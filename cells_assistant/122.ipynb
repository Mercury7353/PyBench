To extract the keywords from the news content, I will first preprocess the text by removing any punctuation, converting the text to lowercase, and then tokenizing the text into words. After that, I will count the frequency of each word and then visualize the word cloud.\n\nLet's start by writing the code to extract the keywords and create a word cloud."

The most frequent words are represented in larger fonts in the word cloud.\n\nThe preprocessing of the news content involved converting the text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and then tokenizing the text into words. After that, I counted the frequency of each word and visualized the word cloud.\n\nAs you can see, some of the prominent keywords in the news content include \"jobs\", \"economy\", \"unemployment\", \"rate\", \"pandemic\", \"economic\", and \"market\".\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you would like to analyze or visualize!"
