One popular tool for image segmentation is the DeepLab model, which is trained to perform semantic image segmentation.\n\nI will use the DeepLab model provided by the TensorFlow library, specifically the \"DeepLabV3\" version. First, I will load the image, apply the DeepLab model to perform image segmentation, and then remove the background based on the segmentation results.\n\nLet's start by loading the image and then applying the DeepLab model for image segmentation."

As a result, I'm unable to directly use the DeepLab model provided by TensorFlow for image segmentation.\n\nA possible alternative would be to use a different library or service that provides image segmentation functionality. One such option is the RemoveBG API, which is capable of removing the background from an image. However, since the access to internet is disabled, I'm unable to use this API directly.\n\nIf you have access to the TensorFlow library, I can provide the code to perform image segmentation with the DeepLab model. Alternatively, if access to an external API is possible, you could use the RemoveBG API to remove the background from the image.\n\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed!"
