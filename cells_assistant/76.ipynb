Now, I will proceed with summarizing the paper and identifying its main contributions based on the extracted content.\n\nLet's summarize the paper and identify its main contributions.\n\n1. Summarization of the Paper:\n   The paper, titled \"WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct,\" appears to focus on enhancing mathematical reasoning for large language models (LLMs) through a technique called Reinforced Evol-Instruct. The authors are affiliated with Microsoft and the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n2. Main Contributions of the Paper (based on the extracted content):\n   - The paper introduces a method called \"Reinforced Evol-Instruct\" as a means to empower mathematical reasoning for large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.\n   - The authors highlight the remarkable performance of large language models and propose their approach as a means to enhance mathematical reasoning within these models.\n   - The proposed method aims to address the challenge of mathematical reasoning within LLMs, which is a significant area of interest in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\n\nThis appears to be the initial summary and main contributions based on the content extracted from the PDF. If there are specific details or sections of the paper that need to be included in the summary, please let me know."
