This suggests that creating content related to entertainment, music, or people and blogs may have a higher chance of gaining popularity on YouTube due to the larger number of channels in these categories.\n\nNext, let's examine the relationship between the number of subscribers, video views, and the country of the YouTube channels to gain insights into potential strategies for gaining popularity."

From the plot, we can see that channels with a higher number of subscribers also tend to have a higher number of video views, which is expected as popular channels attract more views.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of channels across different countries is visible in the plot, and we can observe that channels from different countries vary in terms of subscribers and video views.\n\nNow, our analysis has provided some insights into the types of videos that could potentially gain popularity. It appears that creating content related to \"Entertainment,\" \"Music,\" or \"People & Blogs\" could be a good starting point. Additionally, focusing on creating engaging and high-quality content to attract subscribers and views is essential.\n\nIf you have specific ideas for video content, I can provide further analysis or guidance based on those ideas.
