Now, let's analyze the periodicity of these functions.\n\nThe sine and cosine functions are both periodic with a period of 2\u03c0. This means that the functions repeat their values every 2\u03c0 units along the x-axis. In other words, after every interval of 2\u03c0, the functions start to repeat the same pattern of values.\n\nThis periodic behavior is a key characteristic of trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine, and it has important applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and signal processing."
