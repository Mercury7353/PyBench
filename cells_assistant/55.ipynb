This suggests that the novel may involve a lot of action or suspense. Additionally, recurring phrases like \"\u5f53\u7136\" (of course), \"\u679c\u7136\" (sure enough), and \"\u53ea\u662f\" (just) indicate that there may be elements of certainty and doubt in the storyline.\n\nBased on the word frequency analysis, it seems that the novel may be themed around action, suspense, and uncertainty in the plot. However, to better understand the overall theme, it would be helpful to have more context or a broader analysis of the content."
