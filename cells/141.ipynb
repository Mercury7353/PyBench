You can give the code and get the execution result of your code.

This demo includes the basic elements of the game such as a bird sprite, ground movement, and collision detection. However, it is very basic and does not include the full gameplay experience of Flappy Bird, such as scoring, multiple obstacles, and sound effects.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <style>\n        #game {\n            position: relative;\n            width: 334px;\n            height: 588px;\n            background: #000;\n            overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        #bird {\n            position: absolute;\n            left: 50px;\n            top: 50px;\n            width: 24px;\n            height: 24px;\n            background: #0A0A0A;\n            transition: top 0.1s ease;\n        }\n        #ground {\n            position: absolute;\n            bottom: 0;\n            width: 334px;\n            height: 118px;\n            background: #46C647;\n            background-repeat: repeat;\n        }\n    </style>\n    <script>\n        var bird = document.getElementById('bird');\n        var ground = document.getElementById('ground');\n        var jumpHeight = 17;\n        var gravity = .5;\n        var score = 0;\n\n        function jump() {\n            var y = parseInt(bird.style.top);\n            if (y >= 5) {\n                y -= jumpHeight;\n            } else {\n                y = 510;\n            }\n            bird.style.top = y + \"px\";\n            setInterval(down, 10);\n        }\n\n        function down() {\n            var y = parseInt(bird.style.top);\n            y += gravity;\n            bird.style.top = y + \"px\";\n            if (y >= 510) {\n                y = 510;\n                gravity = 0.5;\n            } else if (y <= 5) {\n                y = 5;\n                gravity = 1;\n            }\n            bird.style.top = y + \"px\";\n            checkCollision();\n        }\n\n        function checkCollision() {\n            if (bird.offsetTop >= ground.offsetTop - 24) {\n                alert('Game Over!');\n                bird.style.top = '50px';\n                gravity = 0.5;\n                score = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {\n            if (event.keyCode === 32) { // Spacebar\n                jump();\n            }\n        });\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game\">\n        <div id=\"bird\"></div>\n        <div id=\"ground\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <p id=\"score\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 10px; font-size: 20px;\">Score: 0</p>\n    <script>\n        setInterval(incrementScore, 500);\n        function incrementScore() {\n            score++;\n            document.getElementById('score').innerText = 'Score: ' + score;\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nTo play the game, open the HTML file in a web browser and use the spacebar to make the bird jump. The game will end when the bird collides with the ground, and the score will be reset.\n\nPlease note that this demo is meant to be simple and does not include many of the features of a fully-featured Flappy Bird game. To create a complete game, you would typically use a game engine or library, add more complex game logic, and possibly include graphics and sound effects."
