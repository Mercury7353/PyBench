Once I have this information, I can proceed with analyzing the distribution of citations across countries.\n\nFor identifying outliers in citation counts, a common approach is to use statistical methods such as calculating z-scores or using interquartile range (IQR). Depending on how the data is structured and distributed, one method may be more appropriate than another.\n\nAfter dealing with citations and their outliers, I'll move on to count countries for each region. This requires understanding how regions are represented in the dataset (e.g., if there's a specific column for regions) and then performing a group-by operation based on that column.\n\nThis Step Todo: Load the Excel file \"./data/AI Country rank 1996-2021.xlsx\" using pandas to inspect its structure.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED):"
