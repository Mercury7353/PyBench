The Poisson process generates noise that is proportional to the brightness of the image. We can use the `np.random.poisson` function to generate the noise and then add it to the image. The intensity of the noise is controlled by a lambda parameter that is proportional to the image pixel values. \n\nThis Step Todo: Generate Poisson noise based on the image pixel values and add it to the image.\n\nCode:\n\n<|execute_start|>"
