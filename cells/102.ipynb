The Canny edge detector is a multi-stage algorithm that involves blurring the image to remove noise, finding the intensity gradient of the image, applying non-maximum suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection, and applying double threshold to determine potential edges. Finally, edge tracking by hysteresis is applied to detect the edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.\n\nThis Step Todo: Load the image from the given path, convert it to grayscale, and apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve edge detection.\n\nAction: Write the code to load the image, convert it to grayscale, and apply Gaussian blur.\n\n<|execute_start|>"
