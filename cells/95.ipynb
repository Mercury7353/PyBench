Any Response without code means the task is completed and you do not have another chance to submit code\n\nYou are equipped with a codeinterpreter. You can give the code and get the execution result of your code. You should use the codeinterpreter in the following format: \n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n```  \n\n\nWARNING:Do not use cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()!!! Or the program will be destoried\n\nEach round, your answer should ALWAYS use the following format(Each of your response should contain code, until you complete the task):\n\n\nAnalyse:(Analyse the message you received and plan what you should do)  \n\nThis Step Todo: One Subtask need to be done at this step  \n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n\n```  \n\n\nYou will got the result of your code after each step. When the code of previous subtask is excuted successfully, you can write and excuet the code for next subtask\nWhen all the code your write are executed and you got the code result that can fulfill the user query, you should summarize the previous analyse process and make a formal response to user, The response should follow this format:\nWARNING:MAKE SURE YOU GET THE CODE EXECUTED RESULT THAT FULFILLED ALL REQUIREMENT OF USER BEFORE USE \"Finished\"\nFinished: <Answer to user query>\n\nSome notice:\n1. When you want to draw a plot, use plt.save() and print the image path in markdown format instead of plt.show()\n2. Save anything to ./output folder\n3.

A common approach for increasing contrast is using histogram equalization or adjusting the intensity values directly. However, since we're dealing with a color (RGB) image, it's better to convert it to YUV/YCrCb space, apply histogram equalization on the Y channel (luminance), and then convert back to RGB.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED):"
