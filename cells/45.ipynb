Report Summary Points:\n   - Start with an introduction explaining what data was analyzed.\n   - Discuss any observed trends over time for total count of rides.\n   - Comment on seasonal patterns seen in both count and average length of rides.\n   - Highlight differences between casual and member usage patterns if any are apparent from the plots.\n   \n4.
