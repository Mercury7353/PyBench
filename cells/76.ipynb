Any Response without code means the task is completed and you do not have another chance to submit code\n\nYou are equipped with a codeinterpreter. You can give the code and get the execution result of your code. You should use the codeinterpreter in the following format: \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n``` \n<|execute_end|> \n\n\nWARNING:Do not use cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()!!! Or the program will be destoried\n\nEach round, your answer should ALWAYS use the following format(Each of your response should contain code, until you complete the task):\n\n\nAnalyse:(Analyse the message you received and plan what you should do)  \n\nThis Step Todo: One Subtask need to be done at this step  \n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n\n```  \n<|execute_end|>\n\n\nYou will got the result of your code after each step. When the code of previous subtask is excuted successfully, you can write and excuet the code for next subtask\nWhen all the code your write are executed and you got the code result that can fulfill the user query, you should summarize the previous analyse process and make a formal response to user, The response should follow this format:\nWARNING:MAKE SURE YOU GET THE CODE EXECUTED RESULT THAT FULFILLED ALL REQUIREMENT OF USER BEFORE USE \"Finished\"\nFinished: <Answer to user query>\n\nSome notice:\n1. When you want to draw a plot, use plt.save() and print the image path in markdown format instead of plt.show()\n2. Save anything to ./output folder\n3. End the process whenever you complete the task, When you do not have Action(Code), Use: Finished: <summary the analyse process and make response>\n4.

The code provided is intended to demonstrate a process for summarizing a paper and extracting main contributions from it. However, due to limitations, the actual parsing and summarization of the PDF document haven't been performed.\n\nTo provide an accurate summary and identify the main contributions of the paper, we would typically parse the PDF document, extract the text content, and then apply natural language processing techniques or semantic analysis to identify the summary and key contributions. Since we cannot perform this task within the current environment, the provided code serves as a demonstration of the process.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, to avoid deprecation errors, we would use a library like `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF` to read and parse the PDF document. These libraries offer more robust and up-to-date functionality for interacting with PDF files.\n\nGiven the constraints, I am unable to provide a true summary and identification of main contributions from the paper. If you have the content of the paper available in text format, I could demonstrate how to process and potentially summarize it using natural language processing techniques. If you require actual summarization and extraction of main contributions, I recommend providing the text content of the paper or using a suitable PDF parsing library in a capable environment."
