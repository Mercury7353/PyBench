After correcting this and obtaining the counts for each gender type (Men and Women), both having equal occurrences in this dataset, I proceeded to draw a pie chart illustrating this distribution. The resulting pie chart has been saved successfully and displays an equal split between Men and Women's sales data from Wisconsin."
