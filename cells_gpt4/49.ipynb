After ensuring there were no missing values, we prepared the dataset by selecting features (excluding the target variable \"Close\") and splitting it into training and test sets. Initially, an attempt to train a Linear Regression model resulted in an error due to non-numeric data present in the features. We resolved this by excluding non-numeric columns before re-training the model. The trained Linear Regression model was then evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), resulting in a Test MSE of 0.017432705668276597, indicating how well the model performed on unseen data. This completes the task of training a model to predict stock prices based on historical stock data provided.\n"
