This value represents the average squared difference between the predicted ranks and the actual ranks.\n\nThis Step Todo: Since we have successfully preprocessed the data, trained a model, and obtained an MSE for its performance, we can now summarize our process and provide a response to the user.\n\nFinished: I have explored your dataset containing world university rankings for 2023, handled missing values by imputation with means for numerical columns, converted non-numeric rank entries into numeric format by handling ranges and outliers such as '1501+' or '201\u2013250', scaled features using standardization, and then trained a Linear Regression model to predict university ranks based on these features. The performance of this model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which resulted in an MSE score of approximately 513.32 on test data. This indicates that there is room for improvement; further feature engineering or trying different models could potentially lead to better predictions.\n"
