The process started by loading the CSV to understand its structure and identify the relevant column ('description') for text extraction. After concatenating all news descriptions into one large string, I used `CountVectorizer` to extract significant keywords while excluding common English stop words. Finally, these keywords were utilized to generate a word cloud image that visually represents the frequency of keyword occurrences within the news content. The generated word cloud was saved as an image in the output folder (`./output/entertainment_wordcloud.png`)."
