Both functions exhibit their characteristic wave patterns, with peaks and troughs at regular intervals. From the graph, it is evident that both sine and cosine have a period of \\(2\\pi\\) radians, meaning they repeat their values every \\(2\\pi\\) radians along the x-axis. This confirms their periodic nature with a fundamental frequency of \\(\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\) Hz in time domain representation if we consider x-axis as time in seconds.\nYou can view the generated plot by accessing this file path: `./output/sin_cos_plot.png`."
