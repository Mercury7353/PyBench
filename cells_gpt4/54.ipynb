Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is generally applied to numerical datasets where the goal is dimensionality reduction or classification, and it requires a target variable (class labels). This type of textual data cannot be directly used in LDA without preprocessing.\n\nThis Step Todo: Since we have text data, I will need to clarify whether the user wants to perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (also abbreviated as LDA but different from Linear Discriminant Analysis), which can be applied on text, or if there was some misunderstanding about the nature of the dataset and what kind of LDA was intended.\n\nSince I cannot ask for clarification, I will assume that we are looking at a case of confusion between Linear Discriminant Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation due to their shared abbreviation. Given this assumption, I'll proceed by extracting features from the text using TF-IDF vectorization which can then be used in topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation.\n\nCode:"
