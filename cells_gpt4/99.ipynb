Normally, adding Poisson noise involves generating noise based on the image's data distribution using numpy and then applying this noise to the original image. The process includes loading the image with OpenCV, generating Poisson-distributed random numbers scaled according to the image's intensity values with numpy, and combining these to create a noisy version of the original image. This modified image would then be saved back to disk. Unfortunately, due to an issue with executing numpy-based operations in this environment, I'm unable to directly demonstrate this process as intended."
