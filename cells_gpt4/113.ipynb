You can give the code and get the execution result of your code. You should use the codeinterpreter in the following format: \n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n```  \n\n\nWARNING:Do not use cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()!!!

To achieve this, I plan to use the OpenCV library for handling images and videos along with PIL (Python Imaging Library) for reading the GIF file frame by frame. The steps include:\n1. Load the GIF file using PIL and extract each frame.\n2. Initialize an OpenCV VideoWriter object with appropriate codec, FPS, and dimensions based on the extracted frames.\n3. Write each extracted frame into the video file using VideoWriter.\n4.
