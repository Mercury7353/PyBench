The first image has a shape of (1920, 1080, 3), while the second image has a shape of (385, 512, 3). To resolve this, we need to resize the images to have the same dimensions before concatenating them.\n\nThis Step Todo: Debug the code by checking the dimensions and types of the resized images before concatenating them.\n\nCode:\n<|execute_start|>"
