Guided by the scaling laws, we introduce DeepSeek LLM,\na project dedicated to advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective.\nTo support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2\ntrillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised \ufb01ne-tuning (SFT)\nand direct preference optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the\ncreation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM\n67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B across a range of benchmarks, especially in the domains of code,\nmathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that our DeepSeek\nLLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5.\n*Authors are ordered alphabetically by the last name.arXiv:2401.02954v1  [cs.CL]  5 Jan 2024Contents\n1 Introduction 3\n2 Pre-Training 4\n2.1 Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.2 Architecture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.3 Hyperparameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.4 Infrastructures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3 Scaling Laws 7\n3.1 Scaling Laws for Hyperparameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n3.2 Estimating Optimal Model and Data Scaling . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n"
