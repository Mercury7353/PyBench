However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath , which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM3and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM .\n1 Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signiﬁcant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1–4], coding [ 5–13] and math [ 14–19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further ﬁne-\ntuning with speciﬁc instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta’s series of Llama [ 4,20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [ 21], StarCoder [ 12], Alpaca [ 22],\nVicuna [ 23], and WizardLM [ 24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25–35].\n⇤Equal contribution.

Self-Consistency [ 34] also achieves remarkable perfor-\nmance on many reasoning benchmarks, which generates several possible answers from the model\nand selects the correct one based on majority vote [ 35]. In recent, [ 36] ﬁnds that process supervision\nwith reinforcement learning signiﬁcantly outperforms outcome supervision for solving challenging\nMATH problems.\nInspired by Evol-Instruct and Process-supervised Reinforcement Learning, this work aims to enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of the SOTA open-source LLM, Llama-2 [ 20]. As shown in the\nFigure 1, we propose a new method named Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which could ﬁrstly generate\ndiverse math instructions data by math-speciﬁc Evol-Instruct , then we train an instruction reward\nmodel (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM) [ 16,36–41], the former indicates the\nquality of the evolved instruction and the later receives feedback for each step in the solution. The\nbrand-new Evol-Instruct method includes two downward evolution and upward evolution progress to\nproduce the grade school math and challenging math respectively. Initially, we re-generate, ﬁlter and\nﬁnetune the original math instruction data from GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43]. Immediately, we train\nthe Llama-2 models to obtain the reward models and our WizardMath .\nWe perform experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k [ 42] and\nMATH [ 43], the results demonstrate that our WizardMath outperforms all other open-source LLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. Speciﬁcally, WizardMath observe a substantial improvement\nin pass@1 with an increase of +24.8 (81.6. vs. 56.8) on GSM8k, and +9.2 (22.7 vs. 13.5) on MATH.\nNotably, our model even also signiﬁcantly surpasses OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.55, Anthropic’s Claude\nInstant-1 [39], and Google’s PaLM-2 [44] in terms of pass@1 on GSM8k.\nThe main contributions of this work are as following:\n•We introduce WizardMath model, which enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities for\nopen-source pretrained large language model Llama-2 [20].\n2•We propose a new method, Reinforced Evol-Instruct , alongside Evol-Instruct and Reinforce-\nment Learning, for improving LLM reasoning performance.\n•WizardMath surpasses all other open-source LLMs by a substantial margin in terms of math-\nematical reasoning, including Llama-2 70B [ 20], Llama-1 65B [ 4], Falcon-40B [ 21], MPT-\n30B8, Baichuan-13B Chat9and ChatGLM2 12B [ 45] on both GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43].\n•WizardMath signiﬁcantly outperforms various main closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT5,\nGPT-3.5, Claude Instant [39], PaLM-2 [44], PaLM-1 [7] and Minerva[15] on GSM8k.\n2 Method\nIn this section, we elaborate on the details of our WizardMath . Following WizardLM and PRMs[ 36],\nwe propose Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which integrates the Evol-Instruct and reinforced process\nsupervision method to evolve GSM8k and MATH, and ﬁne-tune the pre-trained Llama-2 with the\nevolved data and reward models.\nAs shown in the Figure 1, our methods apply three steps:\n1.Supervised ﬁne-tuning.\n2.Training instruction reward model, and process-supervised reward model.\n3.Active Evol-Instruct, and PPO training.\n2.1 Supervised ﬁne-tuning\nFollowing InstructGPT[ 2], we also ﬁrstly ﬁne tune the base with supervised instruction-response\npairs, which contains:\n1.To make the parsing of each step easier, we few-shot re-generate 15k answers for GSM8k\nand MATH with an Alpha version of WizardLM 70B model to produce solutions in a\nstep-by-step format, then ﬁnd out those with a correct answer, and use this data to ﬁnetune\nbase Llama model.\n2.To enhance the model’s ability to adhere to the neural and diverse instructions, we also\nsample 1.5k open-domain conversations from WizardLM’s training data, then merge it with\nabove math corpus as the ﬁnal SFT training data.\n2.2 Evol-Instruct principles for math\nMotivated by the Evol-Instruct [ 24] method proposed by WiazrdLM and its effective application\non WizardCoder [ 13], this work attempts to make math instructions with various complexities and\ndiversity to enhance the pre-trained LLMs. Speciﬁcally, we adapt Evol-Instruct to a new paradigm\nincluding two evolution lines:\n1.Downward evolution: It enhances instructions by making the questions easier. For example\ni): revising high difﬁculty questions to lower difﬁculty, or ii) producing a new and easier\nquestion with another different topic.\n2.Upward evolution: Derived from original Evol-Instruct method, it deepens and generates\nnew and harder questions by i) adding more constraints, ii) concretizing, iii) increasing\nreasoning.\n2.3 Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nInspired by InstructGPT[ 2] and PRMs[ 36], we train two reward models to predict the quality of the\ninstructions and the correctness of each step in the answer respectively:\n1.Instruction Reward Model (IRM): This model aims to judge the quality of the evolved\ninstructions on three aspects: i) Deﬁnition, ii) Precision, and iii) Integrity. To produce\nthe ranking list training data of IRM, for each instruction, we ﬁrstly use ChatGPT and\n3\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finished: \n\nThe paper titled \"WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct\" presents a method to enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of math.

    对于金棺中这个人，他是生是死，实在引不起青樱过多的悲喜。他，不过是自己夫君的父亲，王朝的先帝，甚至，遗弃了自己表姑母的男人。\\n  \\n        想到这里，青樱不觉打了个寒噤，又隐隐有些欢喜。一朝王府成潜龙府邸，自己的夫君君临天下，皆是拜这个男人之死所赐。这样的念头一转，青樱悄然抬眸望向别的妻妾格格——不，如今都是妃嫔了，只是名分未定而已。\\n  \\n        青樱一凛，复又低眉顺眼按着位序跪在福晋身后，身后是与她平起平坐的高晞月，一样的浑身缟素，一样的梨花带雨，不胜哀戚。\\n  \\n        忽然，前头微微有些骚动起来，有侍女低声惊呼起来：“主子娘娘晕过去了！”\\n  \\n        青樱跪在前头，立时膝行上前，跟着扶住晕过去的富察氏。高晞月也跟着上来，惶急道：“主子娘娘跪了一夜，怕是累着了。快去通报皇上和太后。”\\n  \\n        这个时候，太后和皇上都已疲乏，早在别宫安置了。青樱看了晞月一眼，朗声向众人道：“主子娘娘伤心过度，快扶去偏殿休息。素心，你是伺候主子娘娘的人，你去通报一声，说这边有咱们伺候就是了，不必请皇上和太后两宫再漏夜赶来。”\\n  \\n        晞月横了青樱一眼，不欲多言。青樱亦懒得和她争辩，先扶住了富察氏，等着眼明手快的小太监抬了软轿来，一齐拥着富察氏进了偏殿。\\n  \\n        晞月意欲跟进伺候，青樱身姿一晃，侧身拦住，轻声道：“这里不能没有人主持，太后和太妃们都去歇息了，主子娘娘和我进去，姐姐就是位分最高的侧福晋。”\\n  \\n        晞月眼眸如波，朝着青樱浅浅一漾，温柔的眼眸中闪过一丝不驯，她柔声细语：“妹妹与我都是侧福晋，我怎敢不随侍在主子娘娘身边？”她顿一顿，“而且，主子娘娘醒来，未必喜欢看见妹妹。”\\n  \\n        青樱笑而不语，望着她淡然道：“姐姐自然是明白的。”\\n  \\n        晞月微微咬一咬唇：“我希望自己永远都能明白。”\\n  \\n        她退后两步，复又跪下，朝着先帝的金棺哀哀痛哭，仿似清雨梨花，低下柔枝，无限凄婉。\\n  \\n        青樱在转入帘幕之前望了她一眼，亦不觉叹然，怎么会有这样的女人？轻柔得如同一团薄雾轻云，连伤心亦是，美到让人不忍移目。\\n  \\n        青樱转到偏殿中，素心和莲心已经将富察氏扶到榻上躺着，一边一个替富察氏擦着脸扑着扇子。青樱连忙吩咐了随侍的太监，叮嘱道：“立刻打了热水来，虽在九月里，别让主子娘娘擦脸着了凉。莲心，你伺候主子娘娘用些温水，仔细别烫着了。”说罢又吩咐自己的侍女，“惢心，你去开了窗透气，那么多人闷着，只怕娘娘更难受。太医已经去请了吧？”\\n  \\n        惢心连忙答应：“是。已经打发人悄悄去请了。”\\n  \\n        素心闻言，不觉双眉微挑，问道：“主子娘娘身子不适，怎么请个太医还要鬼鬼祟祟的？”\\n  \\n        青樱含笑转脸：“姑娘不知道，不是鬼鬼祟祟的。而是方才高姐姐的话说坏了。”\\n  \\n        素心颇为不解，更是疑心：“说坏了？”\\n  \\n        青樱不欲与她多言，便走前几步看着太监们端了热水进来，惢心侧身在素心身边，温和而不失分寸：“方才月福晋说，主子娘娘是累着了才晕倒的……”\\n  \\n        素心还欲再问，富察氏已经悠悠醒转，轻嗽着道：“糊涂！”\\n  \\n        莲心一脸欢欣，替富察氏抚着心口道：“主子娘娘要不要再喝些水？哭了一夜也该润润喉咙了。”\\n  \\n        富察氏慢慢喝了一口水，便是不适也不愿乱了鬓发，顺手一抚，才慢慢坐直身子，叱道：“糊涂！还不请侧福晋坐下。”\\n  \\n        青樱闻得富察氏醒转，早已垂首侍立一边，恭声道：“主子娘娘醒了。”\\n  \\n        富察氏笑笑：“主子娘娘？这个称呼只有皇后才受得起，皇上还未行册封礼，这个称呼是不是太早了？”\\n  \\n        青樱不卑不亢：“主子娘娘明鉴。皇上已在先帝灵前登基，虽未正式册封皇后，可主子娘娘是皇上结发，自然是名正言顺的皇后。如今再称福晋不妥，直呼皇后却也没有旨意，只好折中先唤了主子娘娘。”青樱见富察氏只是不做声，便行了大礼，“主子娘娘万福金安。”\\n  \\n        富察氏也不叫起来，只是悠悠叹息了一声：“这样说来，我还叫你侧福晋，却是委屈你了。”\\n  \\n        青樱低着头：“侧福晋与格格受封妃嫔，皆由主子娘娘统领六宫裁决封赏。妾身此时的确还是侧福晋，主子娘娘并未委屈妾身。”\\n  \\n        富察氏笑了一笑，细细打量着青樱：“青樱，你就这般滴水不漏，一丝错缝儿也没有么？”\\n  \\n        青樱越发低头，柔婉道：“妾身没有过错得以保全，全托赖主子娘娘教导顾全。”\\n  \\n        富察氏凝神片刻，温和道：“起来吧。”又问，“素心，是月福晋在外头看着吧？”\\n  \\n        素心忙道：“是。”\\n  \\n        富察氏扫了殿中一眼，叹了口气：“是青福晋安排的吧？果然事事妥帖。”她见素心有些不服，看向青樱道，“你做得甚好，月福晋说我累了……唉，我当为后宫命妇表率，怎可在众人面前累晕了？只怕那些爱兴风作浪的小人，要在后头嚼舌根说我托懒不敬先帝呢。来日太后和皇上面前，我怎么担待得起？”\\n  \\n        青樱颔首：“妾身明白，主子娘娘是为先帝爷驾崩伤心过度才晕倒的。高姐姐也只是关心情切，才会失言。”\\n  \\n        富察氏微微松了口气：“总算你还明白事理。”她目光在青樱身上悠悠一荡，“只是，你处事一定要如此滴水不漏么？”\\n  \\n        青樱低声：“妾身伺候主子，不敢不尽心。”\\n  \\n        富察氏似赞非赞：“到底是乌拉那拉氏的后人，细密周到。”\\n  \\n        青樱隐隐猜到富察氏所指，只觉后背一凉，越发不敢多言。\\n  \\n        富察氏望着她，一言不发。青樱只觉得气闷难过，这样沉默相对，比在潜邸时妻妾间偶尔或明或暗的争斗更难过。\\n  \\n        空气如胶凝一般，莲心适时端上一碗参汤：“主子喝点参汤提提神，太医就快来了。”\\n  \\n        富察氏接过参汤，拿银匙慢慢搅着，神色稳如泰山：“如今进了宫，好歹也是一家人，你就不去看看景仁宫那位吗？”\\n  \\n        青樱道：“先帝驾崩，太后未有懿旨放景仁宫娘娘出宫行丧礼，妾身自然不得相见。”\\n  \\n        富察氏微微一笑，搁下参汤：“有缘，自然会相见的。”\\n  \\n        青樱越发不能接口。富察氏何曾见过她如此样子，心中微微得意，脸上气色也好看了些。\\n  \\n        二人正沉默着，外头击掌声连绵响起，正是皇帝进来前侍从通报的暗号，提醒着宫人们尽早预备着。\\n  \\n        果然皇帝先进来了。富察氏气息一弱，低低唤道：“皇上……”\\n  \\n        青樱行礼：“皇上万福金安。”\\n  \\n        皇帝也不看她，只抬了抬手，随口道：“起来吧。”\\n  \\n        青樱起身退到门外，扬一扬脸，殿中的宫女太监也跟了出来。\\n  \\n        皇帝快步走到榻边，按住富察氏的手：“琅，叫你受累了。”\\n  \\n        富察氏眼中泪光一闪，柔情愈浓：“是臣妾无能，叫皇上担心了。”\\n  \\n        皇帝温声道：“你生了永琏与和敬之后身子一直弱，如今既要主持丧仪，又要看顾后宫诸事，是让你劳累了。”\\n  \\n        富察氏有些虚弱，低低道：“晞月和青樱两位妹妹，很能帮着臣妾。”\\n  \\n        皇帝拍拍她的手背：“那就好。”皇帝指一指身后，“朕听说你不适，就忍不住来了，正好也催促太医过来，给你仔细瞧瞧。”\\n  \\n        富察氏道：“多谢皇上关爱。”\\n  \\n        青樱在外头侍立，一时也不敢走远，只想着皇帝的样子，方才惊鸿一瞥，此刻倒是清清楚楚印在了脑子里。\\n  \\n        因着居丧，皇帝并未剃发去须，两眼也带着血丝，想是没睡好。想到此节，青樱不觉心疼，悄声向惢心道：“皇上累着了，怕是虚火旺，你去炖些银耳莲子羹，每日送去皇上宫里。记着，要悄悄儿的。”\\n  \\n        惢心答应着退下。恰巧皇帝带了人出来，青樱复又行礼：“恭送皇上，皇上万安。”\\n  \\n        皇帝瞥了随侍一眼，那些人何等聪明，立刻站在原地不动，如泥胎木偶一般。皇帝上前两步，青樱默然跟上。皇帝方悄然道：“朕是不是难看了？”\\n  \\n        青樱想笑，却不敢做声，只得咬唇死死忍住。二人对视一眼，青樱道：“皇上保重。”\\n  \\n        皇帝正好也说：“青樱，你保重。”\\n  \\n        青樱心中一动，不觉痴痴望着皇帝。皇帝回头看一眼，亦是柔情：“朕还要去前头，你别累着自己。”\\n  \\n        青樱道了声“是”。见皇帝走远了，御驾的随侍也紧紧跟上，只觉心头骤暖，慢慢微笑出来。\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n第二章 自处\\n\\n  \\n        外头的月光乌蒙蒙的，暗淡得不见任何光华，青樱低低说：“怕是要下雨了呢。”\\n  \\n        惢心关切道：“小主站在廊檐下吧，万一掉下雨珠子来，怕凉着了您。”\\n  \\n        正巧素心引着太医出来，太医见了青樱，打了个千儿道：“给小主请安。”\\n  \\n        青樱点点头：“起来吧。主子娘娘凤体无恙吧？”\\n  \\n        太医忙道：“主子娘娘万安，只是操持丧仪连日辛劳，又兼伤心过度，才会如此。只须养几日，就能好了。”\\n  \\n        青樱客气道：“有劳太医了。”\\n  \\n        素心道：“太医快请吧，娘娘还等着你的方子和药呢。”\\n  \\n        太医诺诺答应了，素心转过脸来，朝着青樱一笑，话也客气了许多：“回小主的话，主子娘娘要在里头歇息了，怕今夜不能再去大殿主持丧仪。主子娘娘说了，一切有劳小主了。”\\n  \\n        青樱听她这样说，知是富察氏知晓晞月不堪重用，只管托赖了自己应对，忙道：“请主子娘娘安心养息。”\\n  \\n        青樱回到殿中，满殿缟素之下的哭泣声已经微弱了许多，大约跪哭了一日，凭谁也都累了。青樱吩咐殿外的宫女：“几位年长的宗亲福晋怕挨不得熬夜之苦，你们去御膳房将炖好的参汤拿来请福晋们饮些，若还有支持不住的，就请到偏殿歇息，等子时大哭时再请过来。”\\n  \\n        宫女们都答应着下去了，晞月在内殿瞧见，脸上便有些不悦。青樱进来，便道：“方才要妹妹替主子娘娘主持一切，实在是辛苦妹妹了。”\\n  \\n        晞月也不做声，只淡淡道：“你一句一句妹妹叫得好生顺口，其实论年岁算，我还虚长了你七岁呢。”\\n  \\n        青樱知她所指，只是在潜邸之中，她原是位序第一的侧福晋，名分分明，原不在年纪上。当下也不理会，只微微笑道：“是么？”\\n  \\n        晞月见她不以为意，不觉隐隐含怒，别过脸去不肯再和她说话。\\n  \\n        过了一个时辰，便是大哭的时候了。合宫寂静，人人忍着困意提起了精神，生怕哀哭不力，便落了个“不敬先帝”的罪名。执礼太监高声喊道：“举哀——”众人等着嫔妃们领头跪下，便可放声大哭了。\\n  \\n        因着富察氏不在，青樱哀哀哭了起来，正预备第一个跪下去。谁知站在她身侧一步的晞月抢先跪了下去，哀哀恸哭起来。\\n  \\n        晞月原本声音柔美，一哭起来愈加清婉悠亮，颇有一唱三叹之效，十分哀戚。连远远站在外头伺候的杂役小太监们，亦不觉心酸起来。\\n  \\n        按着在潜邸的位分次序，便该是晞月在青樱之后，谁知晞月横刺里闯到了青樱前头放声举哀，事出突然，众人一时都愣在了那里。\\n  \\n        潜邸的格格苏绿筠更是张口结舌，忍不住轻声道：“月福晋，这……青福晋的位次，是在您之上啊。”\\n  \\n        晞月根本不理会苏氏的话，只纹丝不动，跪着哭泣。\\n  \\n        青樱当众受辱，心中暗自生怒，只硬生生忍着不做声。惢心已经变了脸色，正要上前说话，青樱暗暗拦住，看了跟在身后的格格苏绿筠一眼，慢慢跪了下去。\\n  \\n        绿筠会意，即刻随着青樱跪下，身后的格格们一个跟着一个，然后是亲贵福晋、诰命夫人、宫女太监，随着晞月举起右手侧耳伏身行礼，齐声哭了起来。\\n  \\n        哀痛声声里，青樱盯着晞月举起的纤柔手腕，半露在重重缟素衣袖间的一串翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯在烛火中透着莹然如春水的光泽，刺得她双目发痛。青樱随着礼仪俯下身体，看着自己手腕上一模一样的镯子，死死地咬住了嘴唇。\\n  \\n        待到礼毕，已子时过半，晞月先起身环视众人，道了声：“今日暂去歇息，明日行礼，请各位按时到来。”如此，众人依序退去，青樱扶着酸痛的双膝起身，扶了惢心的手，一言不发就往外走。\\n  \\n        格格苏绿筠一向胆小怕事，默然撇开侍女的手，紧紧跟了过来。\\n  \\n        青樱心中有气，出了殿门连软轿都不坐，脚下越走越快，直走到了长街深处。终于，惢心亦忍不住，唤道：“小主，小主歇歇脚吧。”\\n  \\n        青樱缓缓驻足，换了口气，才隐隐觉得脚下酸痛。一回头却见绿筠鬓发微蓬，娇喘吁吁，才知自己情急之下走得太快，连绿筠跟在身后也没发觉。\\n  \\n        青樱不觉苦笑，柔声道：“你生下三阿哥才三个多月，这样跟着我疾走，岂不伤了身子？”青樱见她身姿孱孱，愈加不忍，“是我不好，没察觉你跟着我来了。”\\n  \\n        绿筠怯怯：“侧福晋言重了，我的身子不相干。倒是今日……高姐姐如此失礼，可怎生是好？”\\n  \\n        青樱正要说话，却见潜邸格格金玉妍坐在软轿上翩跹而来。\\n  \\n        金玉妍下了软轿，扶着侍女的手走近，笑吟吟道：“怎生是好？这样的大事，总有皇上和主子娘娘知道的时候，何况还有太后呢。侧福晋今日受的委屈，还怕没得报仇么？”\\n  \\n        青樱和缓道：“自家姐妹，有什么报仇不报仇的，玉妍妹妹言重了。”\\n  \\n        金玉妍福了一福，又与苏绿筠见了平礼，方腻声道：“妹妹也觉得奇怪，高姐姐一向温柔可人，哪怕从前在潜邸中也和侧福晋置气，却也不至如此。难道一进宫中，人人的脾气都见长了么？”\\n  \\n        绿筠忙道：“何人脾气见长了？玉妍妹妹得皇上宠爱，可以随口说笑，咱们却不敢。”\\n  \\n        玉妍媚眼如丝，轻俏道：“姐姐说到宠爱二字，妹妹就自愧不如了。现放着侧福晋呢，皇上对侧福晋才是万千宠爱。”她故作沉吟，“哎呀！难道高姐姐是想着，进了紫禁城，侧福晋会与景仁宫那位一家团聚，会失幸于皇上和太后，才会如此不敬？”\\n  \\n        青樱略略正色：“先帝驾崩，正是国孝家孝于一身的时候，这会子说什么宠爱不宠爱的，是不是错了时候？”\\n  \\n        绿筠忙收了神色，恭身站在一旁。玉妍托着腮，笑盈盈道：“侧福晋好气势，只是这样的气势，若是方才能对着高姐姐发一发，也算让高姐姐知道厉害了呢。”玉妍屈膝道，“夜深人困倦，才进宫就有这样的好戏，日后还怕会少么？妹妹先告辞，养足了精神等着看呢。”\\n  \\n        玉妍扬长而去，绿筠看她如此，不觉皱了皱眉。\\n  \\n        青樱劝道：“罢了。你不是不知道金玉妍的性子，虽说是和你一样的格格位分，在潜邸的资历也不如你，但她是朝鲜宗室的女儿，先帝特赐了皇上的，咱们待她总要客气些，无须和她生气。”\\n  \\n        绿筠愁眉不展：“姐姐说得是，我何尝不知道呢？如今皇上为了她的身份好听些，特特又指了上驷院的三保大人做她义父，难怪她更了不得了。”\\n  \\n        青樱安慰道：“我知道你与她住一块儿，难免有些不顺心。等皇上册封了六宫，迟早会给你们安置更好的宫殿。你放心，你才生了三阿哥，她总越不过你去的。”\\n  \\n        绿筠忧心忡忡地看着青樱：“月福晋在皇上面前最温柔、善解人意，如今一进宫，连她也变了性子，还有什么是不能的？”绿筠望着长街甬道，红墙高耸，直欲压人而下，不觉瑟缩了细柔的肩，“常道紫禁城怨魂幽心，日夜作祟，难道变人心性，就这般厉害么？”\\n  \\n        这样乌深的夜，月光隐没，连星子也不见半点。只见殿脊重重叠叠如远山重峦，有倾倒之势，更兼宫中处处点着大丧的白纸灯笼，如鬼火点点，来往皆白衣素裳，当真凄凄如鬼魅之地。\\n  \\n        青樱握了握绿筠的手，温和道：“子不语怪力乱神。绿筠你好歹还痴长我几岁，怎么倒来吓我呢？何况高晞月的温柔，那是对着皇上，可从不是对着我们。”\\n  \\n        绿筠闻言，亦不觉含笑。\\n  \\n        青樱望着这陌生的紫禁城，淡然道：“你我虽都是紫禁城的儿媳，常常入宫请安，可真正住在这里，却也还是头一回。至于这里是否有怨魂幽心，我想，变人心性，总是人比鬼更厉害些吧。”\\n  \\n        毕竟劳碌终日，二人言罢也就散去了。\\n  \\n        晞月回到宫中，已觉得困倦难当。晞月在和合福仙梨木桌边坐下，立时有宫女端了红枣燕窝上来，恭声道：“小主累了，用点燕窝吧。”\\n  \\n        晞月扬了扬脸示意宫女放下，随手拔下头上几支银簪子递到心腹侍婢茉心手中，口中道：“什么劳什子！暗沉沉的，又重，压得我脑仁疼。”说罢摸着自己腕上碧莹莹的翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯，“还好这镯子是主子娘娘赏的，哪怕守丧也不必摘下。否则整天看着这些黯沉颜色，人也没了生气。”\\n  \\n        茉心接过簪子放在妆台上，又替晞月将鬓边的白色绢花和珍珠压鬓摘下，笑道：“小主天生丽质，哪怕是簪了乌木簪子，也是艳冠群芳。何况这镯子虽然一样都有，小主戴着就是比青福晋好看。”\\n  \\n        晞月瞥她一眼，笑吟吟道：“就会说嘴。艳冠群芳？现放着金玉妍呢，皇上可不是宠爱她芳姿独特？”\\n  \\n        茉心笑：“再芳姿独特也不过是个小国贱女，算什么呢？主子娘娘体弱，苏绿筠性子怯懦，剩下的几个格格侍妾都入不得眼，唯一能与小主平起平坐的，不过一个乌拉那拉青樱。只是如今小主已经作了筏子给她瞧了，看她还能得意多久！”\\n  \\n        晞月慢慢舀了两口燕窝，轻浅笑道：“从前她总仗着是先帝孝敬皇后和景仁宫皇后的表侄女儿，又是先帝和太后指婚给皇上的，得意过了头。如今太后得势，先帝与孝敬皇后都已作古，景仁宫那位反倒成了她的累赘了。想来太后和皇上也不会再敷衍她。”\\n  \\n        茉心替晞月捶着肩道：“可不是么，奴婢瞧主子娘娘也不愿看她。”\\n  \\n        晞月叹口气：“从前虽然都是侧福晋，我又比她年长，可是我进府时才是格格，虽然后来封了侧福晋，可旁人眼里到底觉着我不如她，明里暗里叫我受了多少气？同样这个镯子，原是一对的，偏要我和她一人一个，形单影只的，也不如一对在一起好看。”\\n  \\n        茉心想着自己小主的前程，也颇痛快：“可不是。小主手腕纤细白皙，最适合戴翡翠了。也是她从前得意罢了，如今给了她个下马威，也算让她知道了。侧福晋有什么要紧，要紧的是在后宫的位分、皇上的宠爱。”\\n  \\n        晞月柔婉一笑，嘉许地看了茉心一眼，又不免有些忧心：“我今日在哭灵时这样做，实在冒险。你的消息可确实么？”\\n  \\n        茉心笑道：“小主放一百二十个心，是主子娘娘身边的莲心亲口来告诉奴婢的，说是听见皇上与主子娘娘说的。给莲心一万个胆子，她也不敢撒这样的弥天大谎啊！”\\n  \\n        晞月闭上秀美狭长的凤眼，笑道：“那就好了。”\\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n第三章 风雨\\n\\n  \\n        夜深。\\n  \\n        殿中富察氏正喝药，莲心伺候在旁，接过富察氏喝完的药碗，又递过清水伺候她漱口。方漱了口，素心便奉上蜜饯，道：“这是新腌制的甜酸杏子，主子尝一个，去去嘴里的苦味儿。”\\n  \\n        富察氏吃了一颗，正要合着被子躺下，忽地仿佛听到什么，惊起身来，侧耳凝神道：“是不是永琏在哭？是不是？”\\n  \\n        素心忙道：“主子万安，二阿哥在阿哥所呢，这个时候正睡得香。”\\n  \\n        富察氏似有不信，担心道：“真的？永琏认床，怕生，他夜里又爱哭。”素心道：“就为二阿哥认床，主子不是嘱咐乳母把潜邸时二阿哥睡惯的床挪到了阿哥所么？宫里又足足添了十六个乳母嬷嬷照应，断不会有差池的。”\\n  \\n        富察氏松了口气：“那就好。只是那些乳母嬷嬷，都是靠得住的吧？还有，大阿哥也住在阿哥所……”\\n  \\n        素心微笑：“主子娘娘的安排，哪次不是妥妥帖帖的？大阿哥虽然也住在阿哥所，但和咱们二阿哥怎么能比？”\\n  \\n        富察氏点点头：“大阿哥的生母虽然和我同宗，却这样没福，偏在皇上登基前就过世了，丢下大阿哥孤零零一个。”她婉转看了素心一眼，“你吩咐阿哥所，对大阿哥也要用心看顾，别欺负了这没娘的孩子。”\\n  \\n        素心含笑：“奴婢明白，知道怎么做。”\\n  \\n        富察氏似乎还不安心，有些辗转反侧。莲心放下水墨青花帐帷，苦口婆心劝道：“主子安置吧，睡不了几个时辰又得起来主持丧仪。今夜您不在，大殿里可不知闹成什么样子了呢。”\\n  \\n        富察氏微微一笑，有些疲倦地伏在枕上，一把瀑布似的青丝蜿蜒下柔婉的弧度，如她此刻的语气一般：“是啊。可不知要闹成什么样子呢？尚未册封嫔妃，她们就都按捺不住性子了么？”\\n  \\n        莲心淡然道：“由得她们闹去，只要主子娘娘是皇后，凭谁都闹不起来。”\\n  \\n        富察氏淡淡一笑：“闹不起来？在潜邸时就一个个乌眼鸡似的，如今只怕闹得更厉害吧。”她翻了个身，朝里头睡了，“只是她们耐不住性子爱闹，就由着她们闹去吧。”\\n  \\n        富察氏不再说话，莲心放下帐帘，素心吹熄了灯，只留了一盏亮着，两人悄然退了出去。\\n  \\n        青樱回到宫中，只仿若无事人一般。陪嫁侍婢阿箬满脸含笑迎了上来：“小主辛苦了。奴婢已经准备好热水，伺候小主洗漱。”\\n  \\n        青樱点点头不说话，抬眼见阿箬样样准备精当，一应服侍的宫女捧着金盆栉巾肃立一旁，静默无声，不觉讶异道：“何必这样大费周章？按着潜邸的规矩简单洗漱便是了。”\\n  \\n        阿箬笑盈盈靠近青樱，极力压抑着喜悦之情，一脸隐秘：“自小主入了潜邸，皇上最宠爱的就是您，哪怕是福晋主子也比不上。高小主虽然也是侧福晋，但她起先不过是个格格，后来才被封的侧福晋，如何比得上您尊贵荣耀？”\\n  \\n        惢心淡淡看她一眼：“好端端的，你和小主说起这个做什么？”\\n  \\n        阿箬笑意愈浓，颇为自得：“大阿哥是富察诸瑛格格生的，诸瑛格格早就弃世而去，那就不提。福晋主子生了二阿哥，将来自然是皇后，但得不得宠却难说。苏小主有了三阿哥，却和高小主一样，是汉军旗出身，那可不行了。”\\n  \\n        青樱慢慢拨着鬓角一朵雪白的珠花。银质的护甲触动珠花轻滑有声，指尖却慢慢沁出汗来，连摸着光润的珍珠都觉得艰涩。青樱不动声色：“那又怎样呢？”\\n  \\n        阿箬只顾欢喜，根本未察觉青樱的神色：“所以呀，小主一定'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File

[1]室外跑步凡是参加健身跑步的人，都应注意坚持经常和循序渐进，特别要注意控制运动量。此外，必须学会“自我控制”，这点尤为重要。因为有时跑步的愿望会突然消失，这就需要将“不能跑”还是“不想跑”加以区分。在锻炼初期，跑步的速度以没有不舒服的感觉为限度，跑完的距离以没有吃力的感觉为宜。跑步后可能出现下肢肌肉疼痛，这是正常反应，坚持锻炼几天后这种现象就会消失。为确定自己锻炼水平的等级，参加跑步锻炼三至四个月后可进行一些测验，测验时以12分钟跑完的距离为计算等级的起点。30-39岁年龄组的人，12分钟跑完的距离达不到1.5-1.8公里，说明锻炼水平较差；如能达到1.8-2.6公里，说明锻炼水平为良好；如能超过2.6公里，即达到优秀锻炼水平。在跑步机上跑步40-49岁年龄组的人，锻炼水平较差者每12分钟跑完的距离为1.6公里以内；良好者为1.7-2.4公里；优秀者为2.5公里以上。50岁以上较差、良好和优秀者每12分钟跑完的距离则分别为1.5公里以内、1.6-2.4公里和2.5公里以上。在短期内取得理想结果是不可能的，只有经常锻炼才会提高锻炼水平。如果一周只跑一次，跑的距离再长也没有多少益处。因为在中断跑步的六天里，身体组织已将跑步带来的好处消耗得一干二净。因此，一周内跑步不得少于三次。平常缺乏锻炼的人，一旦决心开始经常性锻炼后，往往运动过量，这样会导致不良后果。根据脉搏数字，不难分析出运动量的大小，及时进行必要的调整。一般来说，跑步5分钟后脉搏跳动不应超过120次/分，跑步10分钟后脉搏跳动不应超过100次/分。如果脉率过速，必须减少运动量或放慢跑步速度。好处减肥1、养成易于燃脂的好体质为什么有的人容易发胖呢，原因就在于平日运动不足，肌力下降，与其此消彼长的脂肪，更是肆无忌惮地积聚起来。一般而言，跑步是一项有氧运动（跑步速度会影响心率，但一般而言认为跑步的心率应控制在有氧心率区间内），通过跑步，我们能提高肌力，令肌肉量适当地恢复正常的水平，同时提高体内的基础代谢水平，加速脂肪的燃烧，养成易瘦体质。2、让身材更紧致年轻跑步不但能燃烧脂肪，如果姿势正确，还能美体塑形，特别是能让下垂的臀部变得圆翘，跑步时摆臂又能锻炼胸廓周围的肌肉，就算瘦也能变得前凸后翘。另外，养成跑步再罪的习惯，可提高体内荷尔蒙分泌，让你的肌肤伸直体态变得更年轻更紧致。3、提高瘦身动力在户外跑跑步，呼吸着新鲜的空气，一来能舒缓平日工作学习的压力，让自己身心放松。二来能活化脑部及内脏机能，使身体变得充满活力。当你时刻感觉舒爽的话，自然就能从容面对所有减肥挑战了，也会变得更有干劲哦，跑步减肥一定要选好鞋和跑道，如果没有条件在合适的跑道上跑，至少鞋一定要够柔软有弹性。膝盖里面的软组织是很脆弱的部位，长期的冲击会磨损它，而且它一旦磨损很难长好。它和骨头不一样，骨头磨损了只要你适当保护恢复还会长回原型，而软组织一旦磨损，很难长回原来的样子，而是乱长，也就是所谓的骨质增生。跑步减肥固然可以增加能量消耗而减轻体重，但也有跑步锻炼后体重非但不降，反而增加的。这是为什么，一、运动量大，饮食量也大。有些人跑步锻炼初期体重下降，坚持一段时间后体重又回升。这是因为跑步在消耗能量物质的同时，还可以刺激消化器官，增进食欲。刚开始尚能控制饮食，使体重下降。一段时间后，由于饥饿难忍，加上减肥的新鲜劲儿已过，索性大饮大食，造成体重增加。二、不能持之以恒。有些人经过一段时间的跑步锻炼后，便因失去兴趣而中止运动。要知道，消化系统的变化比运动系统慢，中止运动后能量消耗明显减少，但胃肠道的吸收功能依然保持“旺盛”状态。此消彼长，体重当然会增加向前是跑步减肥姿势最重要的一个环节。保证向前的动力能防止疲劳后动作的变形，建议进行力量和拉伸练习。跑步者的伸拉练习应该是“动力伸拉”，而不是普通的静力伸拉，因为跑步本身是动力性质的。在跑步之前要按照自己的自身情况制定一套减肥方法，比如说多少分钟内跑多少多少米，要跑多久之类的。这样才能更有效快速的瘦下来。而且运动之前要做热身运动，以防在运动的过程中会受伤之类的。跑步减肥不是跑得越快越好，而是跑步的速度适中，速度要一致。不能忽快忽慢，忽走忽跑的，这样绝对不是正确的方法。慢跑也好加速跑也好，大家都要认真进行，不要跑到一般觉得累的时候就直接放弃，这样可能会让你更胖呢!跑步之后不要立马坐下来，最好再凳跨愚做一个整理运动，或者慢慢的散步几分钟，这样慢慢沉淀细胞让身体有个缓冲过程。跑步减肥的最佳时间：早晨与傍晚早上空气清新，很是有利跑步，迎着和暖的阳光，慢慢地进行跑步，可以神清气爽，让人精神愉悦，能从一早帮你提高机体的新陈代谢，但早上空气湿度较大，空气中附着的颗粒较多，对于呼吸道有疾病的人不适合。傍晚进行跑步减肥，在吃饭前跑步也不错，气温比较适中，跑步也不产生燥热感，对于控制晚餐帮助还很大。跑之前喝杯水在开始跑步的时候，先喝上一杯水，可以补充一下身体在跑步过程中散发的水分，还可以吃1根香蕉，在跑步之后，增加肠胃蠕动，缓解出现的便秘现象。跑步减肥之前，补充水分很有必要，这样能防止在跑步过程中出现的脱水现象。跑累了停下来步行一下跑步减肥运动要循序渐进，千万不要一开始就强烈的运动，要缓慢而来，每周跑2次，每次跑10-15分钟即可。等熟练了以后，在慢慢增加跑步的运动量和运动强度。例如每周跑3次，每次跑20分钟以上，慢慢循序渐进会有更好的减肥效果。预防疾病跑步降低疾病的风险定期跑步能降低以下疾病的风险：乳腺癌25%、白内障35%、胃癌50%、抑郁症19%、严重心脏病发作50%。锻炼肺活量锻炼肺活量当你跑步时，那两片工作辛苦的肺叶肯定也会得到很好的锻炼。当你从15岁开始跑步直到生命尽头，你的心跳次数都是每分钟40-60次。锻炼肺活量骨府懂骼30分钟高强度运动每天30分钟高强度运动是你强健骨骼所需。促进健康提高睡眠质量通过跑步，大脑的供血、供氧量可以提升25%，这样夜晚的睡眠质量也会跟着提高。“通风”作用在跑步的过程中，肺部的容量平均从5.8升上升到6.2升，同时，血液中氧气的携带量也会大大增加。“泵”力大增运动中，心脏跳动的频率和功效都大大提高，心跳、血压和血管壁的弹性也随着升高。促进健康跑步可以促进白血球和热原质的生成，它们能够消除我们体内很多病毒和细菌。保持稳固经常慢跑练习，肌腱、韧带和关节的抗损伤能力会有所加强，减少运动损伤的几率。同时，皮肤、肌肉和结缔组织也可以变得更加牢固。消除紧张感慢跑可以抑制肾上腺素和皮质醇这两种造成紧张的激素的分泌，同时可以释放让人感觉轻松“内啡呔”。保持年轻经常运动，生长激素HGH的分泌增多并且可以使皮肤紧致、延缓衰老。储存能量通过跑步，肌肉肝糖原的储存量从350克上升到600克，同时线粒体的数量也会上升。塑凝影形通过跑步，女性体内的脂肪含量可以减少12%-20%，男性可以减少6%-13%。注意事项播报编辑姿势跑步姿势要合理。上身应挺直并略前倾，双肩放松，双肘自然弯曲，双臂有力的在身体两侧前后摆动。跑步过程中，双足有弹性的全足着地的跑动，步幅无须大，但步频与步幅要基本保持均匀。注意身体重心稳定，不要有大幅度起伏 [2]。呼吸跑步中的呼吸问题很重要。呼吸要有一定节律，用鼻、嘴同时呼吸时，嘴不必张得太大，可将舌卷起，延长空气在口腔里的时间，减少冷空气对呼吸道的刺激。初跑者可采用两步一吸，三步一呼的方式。每一次呼吸要注意尽可能将气体从肺中呼尽，以增大有效的换气量。力量随着年龄的增长，我们的体力和精神承受能力已经下降到如同悬崖的边缘上了。肌蛋白的减少是随年龄增长而出现的典型病症。在老年人中，由于其肌肉力量的下降和身体极度地虚弱，摔倒和骨折是比较常见的。研究表明：力量训练也能有效地减少老年人摔倒的频率及骨折。不管什么年龄的跑步者，很少有人努力去锻炼腿部以外的肌肉。但是，在日常训练中，有规律地安排一系列简单的上身力量练习，将有效地提高训练者的跑步能力。目的是提高肩臂的力量和耐力，以及腹部和背部肌肉的力量。通过合理地利用双臂，跑步者的成绩可以提高近12%。不知道利用双臂的普通的跑步者就很不幸，跑步的距离越长，双臂就越疲劳。增加上臂的力量可通过简单的俯卧撑练习。尽可能地加强跑步的力量，一旦有了一定的耐力基础，加大步幅最简单的方法就是山地跑。有规律的山地跑计划将对日常跑步产生奇效，对比赛成绩更是有显著效果。山地跑可增强跑步者的大腿力量，增强腿部的协调性，更可增强大脑的协调性。对老年跑步者作用更大。在斯坦福大学的调查结果表明：跑山的老年人的骨质密度比那些没参加训练和参加缺乏刺激训练的老年人的要大得多。速度对一个跑步者来讲，有很多方法进行速度训练：到田径场上，重复进行各种各样的短距离跑；做速度游戏；从上坡快速地地跑下来；参加比赛等。速度训练对每个人都是可以的，对老年人得作用更大，因为它在保持步态的同时，也保持了人体良好的生物力学结构，而这两者将随着年龄的增长逐渐消失。许多没跑过步的成年人，认为自己只是适应日复一日的以每英里10分钟的速度慢跑，而不管跑的强度和速度，这是不正确的。提高速度可以通过三种方法：⒈增加步频⒉增大步幅⒊既增加步频又增大步幅第一种方法比第二种方法更可取，步幅的增大会造成步幅过大，进而会引起某些生物力学上的问题和运动损伤。速度训练，尤其是在田径场的速度训练应该是逐渐的（无痛的）提高步频和步幅的训练。重要的是要循序渐进地提高。田径场上的速度训练对于发展速度的感觉是非常重要的，同时也提供了一个改进跑步形式的机会。在田径场上什么是最好的、最简单的训练法呢？休息坚持跑步健身跑步的4个要素中，许多跑步者在训练耐力方面打下了一个良好的基础。有的跑步者把速度与耐力协调得相当好。但是，很少有跑步者认真对待休息这个重要的部分。有足够的证据证明，休息在4个基本的要素中是最主要的因素。跑步给我们带来很多的好处，而这些好处都是我们用代价换来的。在跑步中这个代价就是肌体内肌肉组织的不断被破坏和重组的反复过程。无休止地跑步最终会导致肌肉损伤，在跑步中，我们认为损伤和过度使用的含义相同。而肌肉组织在休息后比原来更加强壮了。为了使我们保持健康，不受损伤，跑得更好，在跑步时需要遵循一些基本的原则。1.每天至少要跑一次，在一天中肌肉有足够多的时间休息，如果一周跑4天，那么不跑的几天，肌肉休息的时间过长，反而没什么效果。2.每周用一些低强度的训练来代替1天或2天的跑步。如在功率自行车上进行有氧、出汗的训练。3.把某些步行活动融入到你的训练之中4.比赛应该少一点。5.在你没有比赛任务而准备维护体能时，应尽量尝试降低运动量，保持成绩和坚持降低训练量。6.有计划地进行深层组织按摩。7.将同样的理论运用到你的日常生活中。我们应该像学习工作一样学习休息和放松这门艺术，这门艺术是值得追求的。通过学习创造性地休息和放松，使我们的身心得到恢复，变的更加强壮。人在跑步时，人体所需氧气需要量随着跑步速度加大而相应增加，为了改变这种情况，需要加快呼吸频率和增加呼吸深度。但是，呼吸频率的加快是有一定限度的，一般最有效的范围是每分钟35～40次。如每分钟最高达到60次，平均一秒钟就要进行一次呼气和吸气，这样势必使呼吸变浅，换气量减少，影响氧气的吸入和二氧化碳的排出，使血液中二氧化碳浓度升高，氧浓度降低。呼吸调整播报编辑呼吸节奏跑步时，有意识地把双脚步伐节奏与呼吸节奏协调起来，一般来说，根据自己体力状况和跑步速度变化，可以采取二步一吸、二步一呼或三步一吸、三步一呼的方法。当呼吸节奏与跑步节奏相适应并形成习惯后，就可避免呼吸急促表浅和节奏紊乱，对加深呼吸的深度极为有利。同时还可减轻呼吸肌的疲劳感和减轻跑步中“极点”出现所带来的不良反应。跑步时采用鼻子吸气。跑步时采用鼻子呼吸并与跑步节奏相协调，能满足体内氧气要求。随着跑步距离和强度加大，氧气需要量增加，改用口鼻吸口呼的呼吸方式，在吸气和呼气时要做到慢、细、长，嘴微张呼气，忌大口快速呼吸或者喘粗气。跑步时呼吸急促，感气憋不畅时，是由于呼气不充分，二氧化碳排出不充分，占据在肺泡之中，限制了氧气的吸入。要想加大呼气量，就用口呼气，并有意识加大呼气的量和呼出的时间。呼吸的主要目的，在于提供人体的氧气需求与排除体内多余的废气。人体安静休息时，每分钟约呼吸10至12次，每次呼吸的量 （潮气量） 约 500ml，也就是说，人体在安静时的每分钟呼吸交换量约5至6公升。尽管每分钟吸入体内的氧气多达1000至1200ml，但是70公斤成人每分钟使用的氧气则只有 300ml左右。人体最大运动时的换气量可以达每分钟 100公升 （约安静时的20倍） ，但是人体的最大氧气摄取量（maximal oxygen uptake）则只有每分钟3000ml。这种呼吸交换量增加，氧气使用率反而降低的现象，似乎说明了呼吸并不是人体耐力运动表现的主要限制因素。尽管呼吸的氧气交换量（外呼吸）比身体组织的氧气交换量（内呼吸）还多，但是对於呼吸循环系统而言，不管是肺部的气体交换、心跳率、心脏每跳输出量、人体的血流分布或静脉的回流等，都不是可以由意识控制的人体运动生理变项。唯有运动时的呼吸方式，才是可以由意识控制的运动生理反应，因此，适当了解跑步时的正确呼吸概念，也是相当有帮助的运动生理知识。状态调整经常有人提出跑步时，随着步伐「2吸1呼」、「2吸2呼」或其它节奏调整的呼吸频率（次数）概念。这种不考虑呼吸交换量大小的原则性说词，是相当错误的跑步呼吸调节概念。事实上，跑步的快慢与呼吸交换量成正比。人体在不同速度下跑步时，每分钟的呼吸交换量可能相差达10倍以上，尽管跑步步伐的快慢也会改变呼吸的次数（频率），但是，绝对不要以为单一个呼吸节奏，就可以完全代表跑步的呼吸调节。人体跑步时的呼吸调节会受到跑步速度的显著影响，尽管两人以相同的速度一起跑步，两人的最佳呼吸节奏（深度与次数）也会有所差异。影响因素人体肺部的气体交换受到呼吸频率（次数）、呼吸深度（潮气量）与死腔大小的影响，因此，到底跑步时要增加呼吸的频率或深度，做为运动时增加呼吸交换量的依据？这个问题的解释与死腔大小有关。所谓死腔代表人体口、鼻、咽喉、气管与支气管等气体通路（约150ml），当吸入的空气通过这些空间时，会保留下死腔大小的空气量，不会进入肺部进行气体交换，因此，尽管安静休息时的每次呼吸量约500ml，但是真正进入肺部进行气体交换的空气量只有350ml，如果以每分钟10次的呼吸次数计算，人体安静休息时的真正肺部气体交换只有3500ml。增加呼吸的深度（每次吸入的空气量），可以显著降低死腔的影响，达成增加肺部气体交换量的目的。特别是随著跑步速度的增快，死腔也会显著增加，如果只以呼吸频率的改变来调节，那么肺部的气体交换效率就不会提升，不利跑步时的氧气增加需求。以口或鼻呼吸如何增加呼吸的深度？是进行跑步呼吸调节的重点。基本上来说，当跑步的速度不是很快，人体的氧气需求量还不高时，以鼻吸气、口吐气的方式，可以获得比较自然的换气调节。此时跑者应尽可能增加鼻子的吸气深度、降低呼吸的频率，以便获得较佳的肺部气体交换效率。当跑步的速度加快后，吸气的深度可以再增加，呼吸的频率也会慢慢提升，若以鼻子吸气的节奏无法达成肺部气体交换的需求（感觉必须以口帮忙吸气）时，表示跑步的速度已经太快，此时放慢跑步的速度，显然比调节呼吸深度或频率还来的重要（呼吸交换量急遽增加，代表无氧代谢增加）。胸式或腹式呼吸以肋骨与胸骨上提扩张胸腔，达成气体进入肺部的呼吸方式，称为胸式呼吸。肋骨与胸骨不动，以横隔膜下缩造成胸腔扩张（腹部突起），达成气体进入肺部的呼吸方式，称为腹式呼吸。事实上，腹式呼吸就是所谓\"气入丹田（下腹部）\"的呼吸调节方式，也是达成增加呼吸深度的有效手段。跑步时采用腹式呼吸的方式来调节，可以显著提升肺部的气体交换效率。活动方式播报编辑穿鞋跑步易于减轻损伤，但容易导致平足穿上运动鞋能够降低地面对足部的冲击，起到缓冲和保护的作用。不仅跑步鞋有这种功能，篮球鞋、足球鞋、网球鞋等都有缓冲作用，而且不同运动鞋根据运动的特定还会加强某一方面的保护作用。比如防滑、弧形设计等。由于运动鞋穿着方便，因此很多人长年累月穿运动鞋。但长期如此，鞋中的宽松环境会导致青少年脚底韧带拉松变长，形成平足。而且运动鞋的透风性不好，极易引发足部皮肤性疾病如足癣、皮炎、湿疹等。光脚跑步能有效运动小腿肌肉、保护脚踝跑步光脚跑步，对环境的要求比较苛刻。人的脚底板跟动物不一样，能光脚外出的范围是有限的，所以，光脚跑步最好是在室内，这样就降低了脚部受伤的几率，只要把室内打扫一下，是可以避免不穿鞋子带来的外部伤害的。然后说说内部伤害。穿着鞋跑步跟不穿鞋跑步，足部用力的地方是不一样的。一般情况下，穿鞋的人习惯脚后跟先着地，但不穿鞋的人下意识的保护脚跟足骨，会习惯性的从头到尾，以前脚掌着地的方式跑步。研究发现，这种跑步方式可以减少疼痛和受伤的可能性，加强小腿部肌肉锻炼，更接近于人类最原始的跑步方式。注意饮食播报编辑前60分钟在锻炼之前，你吃下去的食物是为了提供能量。它将会让你的“油箱”加满，提升大脑能量并专注于锻炼。这时候应该吃高热能食物，来一根能量棒吧，它是由谷物制成的零食，吃起来口感很像蛋卷，能给你带来足够的能量，且让你不觉得太饱也不会觉得太饿。前20分钟如果你在锻炼前只有20分钟时间，液体或高G1值的食物是最合适的。这些快速起效的碳水化合物将有助于减少锻炼时的腹部不适或岔气，同时提供即时的爆发能量。这时候应该吃高维生素食物，开一瓶维生素饮料或者来一块由白面包制成的蜂蜜或者果酱三明治吧。这类食物消化起来很快。前5分钟锻炼前吃零食从来都不是必须的，但如果你的能量不足或不得不在一场长时间会议之后冲向健身房，它能够提供即时的能量补充。这时候你需要少量的高G1的碳水化合物，比如吃一小把葡萄干、杏仁或者枣。后5分钟让人极度疲劳的健身课程耗尽了你存储的肝糖——它是很容易获得的能量来源，存储在你的肌肉中，同时损伤了你的肌肉组织。因此，你的目标是尽可能快的补充这些存储能量，这样你的肌肉才能够被修复并且未接下来的课程做好准备。这时候你需要大量高蛋白质去修复并重建损伤的肌肉组织。后45~60分钟这时候应该多吃一点，研究表明人们应该在运动后两小时内进餐，这时的补给速度是最快的。此时，吃一餐高碳水化合物并含有低脂蛋白质的食物不仅能增加被肌肉消耗的葡萄糖，同时也能满足促成蛋白质进入肌肉，使其修复。这时候你应该吃补充电解质的食物。比如一份搭配了瘦肉酱的意大利面以及一份混合蔬菜。补充因出汗流失的电解质以促进身体对液体的吸收也是很有必要的。锻炼前后播报编辑跑步前人体各内脏器官及四肢从相对静止状态到较紧张活动需要有个适应过程，因此，人在进行跑步前同样要作适当的准备活动，使机体生理机能能够在动的情况下协调地工作。如果跑前不做准备活动，长跑时往往会发生关节韧带、肌腱扭伤。特别是一起身就进行紧张的跑步，更易发生。跑步前一般可做以下几节准备活动：（1）站立，两手叉腰，交替活动踝关节；（2）半蹲，两手扶膝活动膝关节；（3）两腿交替高抬腿，活动髋关节；（4）两手叉腰旋腰，活动腰部；（5）一手扶持，依次前后踢腿、活动髋、膝关节；（6）前后弓箭步压腿；左右压腿，牵扯腿部韧带；（7）上体前后屈以及上肢的轻微活动等。只有正确的姿势才能让你跑得快，效率高，而且不易受伤。消耗脂肪的关键之一是尽量用接近你的无氧界限（无氧阈）的运动强度跑步，而正确的姿势能使你无需浪费额外的能量就能达到这个强度。跑步后1.不蹲坐休息健身运动后若立即蹲坐下来休息，会阻碍下肢血液回流，影响血液循环，加深机体疲劳。该情况多见于那些运动量比较大的活动，如长跑。正确的做法是在每次运动结束后，多做一些放松、整理活动，如慢行，舒腿等。2.不在大汗淋漓时洗冷水浴（或游泳）运动后大汗淋漓时，体表毛细血管扩张，体内热量大量散发。此时若遇冷水则导致毛细血管骤然收缩，易使身体的抵抗力降低，而引起疾病。3.不“省略”整理活动每次运动后感觉心力俱乏时，应适宜的放松，如徒手操、步行、放松按摩等，会有助于消除肌肉的疲劳，快速恢复体力。4.不贪吃冷饮运动时会损失大量热量，急需补充无可非议。但运动后人体消化系统仍处于抑制状态，贪吃大量冷饮，极易引起胃肠痉挛、腹泻、呕吐、并易诱发胃肠道疾病。5.不立即吃饭在运动时，全身的血液进行重新分配，使得胃肠道的蠕动减弱、各种消化腺的分泌也大为减少，若在运动后不经休息立即吃饭，就容易引起人体消化系统的紊乱和功能性失调，易得病.6.不吸烟运动时人的呼吸加速，机体要保证足够的氧气摄入量。如果运动后立即吸烟，将会使肺内含氧量减少，出现胸闷、气喘、呼吸困难、头昏、乏力等现象。7.不宜骤降体温如果室外温度较高，运动后会感到燥热难耐，倘若此时立即走进空调房间或风口纳凉小憩，会打破正常的生理调节机能，使生理功能失调，易得感冒、腹泻、哮喘、风寒痹痛等疾病。8.不宜马上洗热水淋浴健身运动后，体内大量血液分布在四肢及体表，若此时马上洗热水澡，就会增加体表的血流量，引起心脏、大脑供血不足，有发生心、脑血管意外的危险性运动技巧播报编辑落地缓冲如果你有仔细观察过他人跑步，你会发现，很多人都是全脚掌着地，落地时的声音也比较大。正确的动作是在跑步时，腾空脚落地时要中位脚先着地，脚掌就不要着地。这是对于脚踝、膝盖的一种保护，防止骨膜炎的发生。摆臂摆臂是在跑步过程当中，保持身体的平衡性和协调性，使身体更自然的摆动，更符合人体运动的韵律。摆臂时，只要记住前不露肘，后不露手，自然的随着脚步而摆动。抬头挺胸跑步时保持抬头挺胸有助于改善人体的呼吸循环系统以及建立正常的记住状态。因为你在跑步过程中，人体在不断的消耗能量，易出现疲劳状况，这时如果你能用你的意志挺起你的脊梁，那么你要改善驼背状况其实就很简单了。呼吸跑步时的呼吸是深远而悠长的，一般采用鼻吸嘴呼，体力下降较为严重时可以采用嘴吸嘴呼方式。心率慢跑作为一种养生的有氧运动，就要和快速跑区分开来。一般来说，最适合身体锻炼的心率律动次数是：(220-年龄)×60%左右。大家跑步的时候可以适当的测量以下。头与肩头与肩都要保持稳定。头要目视前方，下颚微收但不要低头。跑步时，肩先放松下垂，然后尽可能上耸，停留一下，恢复原来的姿势再重复。臂和手手要微微握住，大小臂屈成约90度，前后自然摆动。要注意向前的手臂不要露肘，向后的手臂不要露出手来。腿用大腿带动小腿，膝关节要朝向脚尖方向，抬到合理的高度后放下再重复。双脚双脚要放松，不要紧缩脚趾，脚抬高到离地10厘米就可放下重复。脚掌落地时前脚掌不要太用力蹬地，以免造成小腿肌肉发达。运动时间播报编辑健身跑步锻炼一般安排在早晨最好，其次是上午7点左右和下午5点左右。中年人由于工作，一般安排在早晨锻炼，一是不与工作发生冲突；二是早晨跑步空气新鲜，新鲜的空气对呼吸系统有好处。另外，人经过睡眠，体力得到恢复，但从生理上讲人仍然存在一定的抑制状态。早晨锻炼，有利于神经的兴奋、振奋精神，促进新陈代谢，对保持充沛的精神和体力投入一天的工作大有好处。也有人认为早上的氧气含量少（植物呼吸作用），空气新鲜只是可吸入颗粒少，而且傍晚人的精神状态最佳，所以应在晚上大约五点至六点进行锻炼。饭前、饭后不宜进行跑步。饭后跑步或跑步后立即进食都会引起胃酸分泌减少，影响对食物的消化，久而久之会引起胃病，一般饭后1个小时后进行锻炼为好，睡前跑步锻炼不好，睡前锻炼会使大脑皮层处于高度兴奋状态，产生多梦或不容易入睡的不良反应。但是，早晨不宜于空腹进行大运动量锻炼，如果健身长跑的距离比较长时，可先喝一小杯糖水或少吃一点点心类的食品。“从理论上来说，黄昏时分，大气内的氧气浓度最高，人的感觉最为灵敏，协调能力最强，体力的发挥和身体的适应能力最强，并且这时血压和心率既低又平稳，确实是适宜锻炼的好时段。”专家说，但是，这并不表示一天中的其他时间就不适合运动。不同的人之间存在明显的个体差异，心肺功能、体质状态不同，其运动时间、运动频次、运动方式也不应千篇一律。应该说，锻炼的最佳时间并不是绝对的，各人之间肯定存在一定的差异。如果有条件的话，专家建议，最好根据健康体检单和自己的作息及饮食规律，咨询一下医生。此外，对于都市中的上班族来说，黄昏时分有的正在加班，有的正在匆匆忙忙往家里赶，正是忙忙碌碌的时候，让他们每天挤出一个小时做运动，非常不现实。其实，对绝大多数正常体质的人来说，只要避开饭前半小时、饭后一小时以及睡觉前一小时内，其他任何时间都可以进行体育锻炼。如果已经养成了晨练的习惯，持之以恒一定也会获益多多，根本没必要改成晚练。运动时间够不够、运动方式适不适合自己，有一个很简单的测量办法：如果运动一段时间后，精神饱满、食欲很好、睡眠质量佳，早起测量脉搏，每分钟跳动次数和以往差不多或变缓，那么恭喜你了，这说明你选择的运动量和运动方式非常适宜;反之，如果运动一段时间之后，经常犯困、睡眠不好，早起测量脉搏，每分钟跳动次数比以往多6次以上，这表示你的运动过量了，应该在医生的指导下进行调整。此外，运动量也切忌一成不变。比如跑步，一开始时间应该短一点，速度慢一点，身体适应一段时间后，再逐渐延长跑步时间、让速度更快一点。男生和女生身体状况有差别，运动项目也切忌雷同。在早上集体锻炼之后，傍晚的安排就应该体现特色和差异性。男生力量比较强，可进行举重、哑铃、篮球、足球等。而女生身体柔韧性好，可安排体操、健身操、单车、游泳等。需要提醒的是，运动并非一定就会健康。对于中小学生来说，每天应保持9～10个小时睡眠。如果为了追求运动效果，一味早起，反而对身体有损。充足的睡眠、均衡的营养再加上适当的运动，只有三者密切结合，才能给人带来健康。此外，早上锻炼之前，一定要吃点流质食物如牛奶、饮料等，切忌空腹上阵。中午要吃好一些，别动不动就吃快餐。运动损伤走跑运动是全民健身中比较普及的运动形式，虽然动作简单，但是同样会产生运动性损伤，如果得不到充分的重视，甚至会造成较为严重的身体损害，达不到健身的目的。常见损伤有：肚子疼肚子疼产生的主要 原因是在正式运动前未进行准备活动，因为心脏惰性大，不能适应运动负荷，引起呼吸肌紊乱“岔气”，或是饭后、饮水后使肠系膜受到过分牵拉。预防：减速，调节呼吸节奏，加深呼吸。同时用手按压，可减轻疼痛。肌肉酸痛小腿肌肉酸痛属于运动过程中的正常生理现象，肌肉收缩产生能量的同时，肌肉内发生一系列变化，三磷酸腺苷、磷酸肌酸、糖原分解放能，若强度过大，血液循环跟不上，氧气供应不足，乳酸堆积，刺激了神经系统，引起了疼痛。处理：热水烫脚、按摩、洗腿。肌肉痉挛俗称腿抽筋，它是一种强直性肌肉收缩不能缓解放松的现象。冬季多发，天冷，未进行准备活动或小腿肌肉受到冷的刺激均会引起肌肉酸痛。处理：保暖、牵引、按摩。胸痛走跑运动中呼吸不均，没有用鼻呼吸，冷气吸入肺，肺血管收缩，血液循环障碍，长时间挺胸跑，胸部持续紧张均会引起胸痛。预防：走跑过程中用鼻呼吸，做好保暖工作。跟腱炎跟腱炎是指跟腱背侧深筋膜和腱组织之间的滑膜层及其结缔组织损伤，造成血液循环障碍，导致腱围及腱组织的损伤性炎症。由于走跑场地不平，过硬，会造成跟腱炎。扁平足，足弓过高，后群肌肌力不足也是主要的发病原因。预防：在鞋跟内加一层软垫，帮助减缓跟腱紧张。足底筋膜炎足底筋膜是一种坚韧及低延展性的纤维组织，它起到了维持足弓的正常弯度的作用，足底筋膜炎患者通常在早上起床或久坐后起来步行时疼痛最为剧烈，行走一段时间后会减轻，因此很多人不注意，继续跑步导致恶化，原因主要是：1.扁平足，2.小腿肌痉挛加重这种损伤。处理：减少跑走的时间。冰敷，避免足趾上翘动作。预防：做伸展运动，进行肌力练习。尿色有变化尿色颜色变深，属于正常生理；尿中出现白色浑浊，是因为体内供应能量的代谢旺盛，磷酸盐排泄增加；尿色变红或酱油色，尿中出现红血球、血红蛋白，肾血液循环障碍，毛细血管通透性增加，即运动性蛋白尿，这种损伤只有在强度较大时才会发生。预防：降低运动强度。被动的危害专家提醒，授人以鱼不如授人以渔，从某种程度上来说，在运动中培养运动兴趣和自我锻炼的能力，这对于中学生们更为重要。研究发现，主动锻炼比被动锻炼的效果要好很多。主动锻炼时，人们心情愉快，内分泌系统运转更好，运动时注意力集中，不容易受伤。而在被动锻炼时，本来就一肚子怨气，情绪和身体对着干，肌肉的协调能力不好，更易导致运动损伤。不适人群跑步是一种简而易行的锻炼方式。适当地参加跑步活动对人们的健康确有许多益处，但是对于某些人来说参加跑步锻炼并不适合。冠心病病人如果在近两个月内曾发生过心前区憋闷疼痛，并放射至左肩胛，不能跑步；平时做轻微的家务，或上一层楼就沉得胸痛、胸闷、气促心慌的人也不宜去跑步；有严重心脏瓣膜病者，如风湿性心脏病，病人常感心慌、下肢浮肿等，先天性心脏病病人稍活动就出现唇周发绀、心跳胸痛者，也不宜参加跑步；此外，各种因素所致的心脏扩大、心律不整，以及高血压病人，在服用降压药后，血压仍持续在较高时，都就禁止参加跑步锻炼，以免发生意外。糖尿病病人注射了胰岛素后，不能空腹参加跑步，以免发生低血糖；重症糖尿病病人在没有注射胰岛素时，或发生急性感染发烧时均不能参加跑步，因为此时体内的胰岛素处于最低水平，跑步时运动量较大，不能很好地利用葡萄糖供给能量，而运用脂肪来补充，因此产生大量的脂肪代谢产物－－酮体，可能发生酸中毒。并且肝功能明显损害、活动性肺结核、急性肾炎等患者都应在病情缓解后，才能逐渐恢复跑步锻炼。 [3]跑步应用播报编辑跑步应用帮你记录各种参数，保存跑步轨迹，从而为你量身制定个性化跑步计划，将成为你跑步途中的好伴侣。其他播报编辑保护脚（1） 晨练健身跑尽量选择较松软的场地，最好在运动场中跑道上练习跑步，不要在很坚硬的地面上跑步。（2） 跑步时不要穿硬底鞋，尽量穿鞋底较软较厚的鞋，最好穿运动鞋、胶鞋，没有胶鞋时也可穿布底鞋，但不要穿硬底皮鞋、塑料鞋。（3） 跑步的姿势要科学合理。应足跟先着地，迅速过渡到脚掌，以利于做好缓冲动作，减少着地时的阻力。腿的后蹬要舒展。脚落地时要利用好缓冲力量，不要太猛，这样跑起来使人感到两脚轻巧而富有弹性，还可以减轻脚的负担，既可持久，又可避免伤痛。（4） 跑步时，鞋带不宜系得太紧，否则会妨碍脚部的血液循环。经常用热水泡脚，至少在每次晨练长跑后和每晚睡前要用热水洗脚，可以降低下肢脚部肌肉的粘滞性，增强关节韧带的弹性和伸展性，也可以防止伤痛，这样有利于第二天早上晨练。（5） 参加晨练健身跑前后，要认真做好充分的热身活动和整理活动，特别是下肢髋关节、膝关节、踝关节、肌肉、肌腱、韧带要充分活动开，才能参加晨练健身跑。这些对于保护好脚也是非常重要的。运动三忌专家指出，有些情况下，运动前一定要做好准备，碰上大雾、阴霾天气，应该取消预定的运动计划。运动时应注意以下几点：一忌不做准备运动。在体育锻炼前做些简单的四肢运动，对安全有效的锻炼身体有好处。因为在寒冷的冬天，人体因受寒冷的刺激而使肌肉、韧带的弹性和延展性明显降低，全身关节的灵活性也较夏秋季节差得多。锻炼前不做准备运动，则易引起肌肉、韧带拉伤或关节扭伤，致使锻炼不能正常进行。二忌大雾天气锻炼。雾是由无数微小的水珠组成的，这些水珠中含有大量的尘埃、病原微生物等有害物质。如在雾天进行锻炼，由于呼吸量增加，势必会吸进更多的有毒物质，影响氧的供给，这会引起胸闷、呼吸困难等症状，严重者会引起鼻炎、肺炎、气管炎、结膜炎以及其他病症。三忌不注意保暖。运动时不可忽视保暖，否则会引起伤风感冒。天气冷的时候，可待身体发热后再逐渐减衣，开始锻炼时不必立即脱掉衣服，也不要等大汗淋漓时再脱衣服，否则容易感冒。运动类型长跑长距离跑简称长跑，英文是long-distance running。最初项目为4英里、6英里跑，从19世纪中叶开始，逐渐被5000米跑和10000米跑替代。据记载，现代最早的正式长跑比赛是1847年4月5日在英国伦敦举行的职业比赛，英国的杰克逊以32分35秒0的成绩夺得6英里跑冠军。奥运会比赛项目男、女均为5000米跑和10000米跑。男子项目1912年列入；女子5000米跑1996年列入，10000米跑1988年列入。短跑短跑是田径径赛项目中的一类，一般包括：50米跑、60米跑、100米跑、200米跑，400米跑，4×100米接力跑，4×400米接力跑等几项；其运动特性：是人们同时以最快的速度，在确定的跑道上跑完规定的距离，并以最先跑完者为优胜的项目；在人体机能供能方面，表现为人体以最大限度地发挥人的本能，并以无氧代谢供能的方式供能。中长跑中长跑（middle and long distance race），是中距离跑和长距离跑的简称。属800米以上距离的田径运动项目。中距离跑项目有男、女800米和1500米；长距离跑项目有男子5000米和10000米，女子3000米、5000米和10000米。中长跑是历史悠久且开展普遍的运动项目。在2000多年前的古代奥林匹克运动会上就有中长跑比赛。19世纪，中长跑在英国已盛行，后来世界各国也都相继开展起来。中国从1910年起也有了中长跑的比赛。跑步瘦身在跑步的时候要注意眼睛要直视前方不要老是左摇右摆的晃头，盯着前面的事物给自己动力：我要跑到那里，我要去到哪里。左顾右盼不仅会影响效率，还会让你的心情变得更加糟糕，越跑越失去动力，所以想要跑步减肥的人记住。跑步减肥的时间最好选择在早晨或者傍晚，因为这两个时间段是最适合跑步的时期，而且跑步的时间要按照自身情况而定，不要盲目地给自己定很高的计划，如果完成不了会气馁，会给下次运动减肥造成不好的影响。跑累的时候偶尔可以休息一会，不要休息太久，也不要停下来，要慢走等到休息足够了继续跑，就一直循环着跑步到走路再到跑步这样的规则。而且跑步的时候速度要匀速，不要猛冲猛跑，前面用尽力气之后就没力了。所以跑步的速度要控制好。如果真的坚持不下去的话，要多给自己鼓励打气，不要说一些“我累了”或者“我坚持不下去了”这些话，要多鼓励自己“你还行，我还可以坚持”，一直这样激励着自己也是一种很好的解压和促进方式。新手上路成长任务编辑入门编辑规则本人编辑我有疑问内容质疑在线客服官方贴吧意见反馈投诉建议举报不良信息未通过词条申诉投诉侵权信息封禁查询与解封©2024\\xa0Baidu\\xa0使用百度前必读\\xa0|\\xa0百科协议\\xa0|\\xa0隐私政策\\xa0|\\xa0百度百科合作平台\\xa0|\\xa0京ICP证030173号\\xa0京公网安备11000002000001号'"},
