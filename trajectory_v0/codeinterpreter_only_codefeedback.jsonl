If the keep parameter is not specified, it defaults to 'first', meaning that for each group of duplicated rows, only the first one is kept. \n\nLet's execute this step.\n```python\n# Check for duplicate rows\nduplicates = data.duplicated()\n\n# Print the number of duplicate rows\nprint(duplicates.sum())\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "0\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The dataset does not contain any duplicate rows.

Since there are no duplicates in this dataset, this step is not necessary. However, I will still execute it to demonstrate how it would be done. \n\nThe pandas function 'drop_duplicates()' is used to remove duplicate rows. It returns a DataFrame with duplicate rows removed.

This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the file not existing, being in the wrong format, or having permission issues.\n\nLet's try to debug the issue by checking the file existence and its format. Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport soundfile as sf\nimport os\n\n# Check if the audio files exist\nif not os.path.isfile('Ghostrifter Official - Serenity.mp3') or not os.path.isfile('Ghostrifter Official - Haze.wav'):\n    print(\"One or both of the audio files do not exist.\")\nelse:\n    # Load the audio files\n    try:\n        audio1, sample_rate1 = sf.read('Ghostrifter Official - Serenity.mp3')\n        audio2, sample_rate2 = sf.read('Ghostrifter Official - Haze.wav')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while reading the audio files: {e}\")\n    else:\n        # Check if the sample rates are the same\n        if sample_rate1 != sample_rate2:\n            # Resample the audio files to match the sample rate\n            audio1 = sf.resample(audio1, sample_rate1, sample_rate2)\n            audio2 = sf.resample(audio2, sample_rate2, sample_rate1)\n\n        # Mix the audio files\n        mixed_audio = sf.add(audio1, audio2)\n\n        # Save the mixed audio file\n        sf.write('mixed_audio.wav', mixed_audio, sample_rate1)\n```\n\nThis code will check if the audio files exist and are in the correct format before attempting to read them.
