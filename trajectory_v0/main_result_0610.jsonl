However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath , which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM3and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM .\n1 Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signiﬁcant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1–4], coding [ 5–13] and math [ 14–19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further ﬁne-\ntuning with speciﬁc instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta’s series of Llama [ 4,20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [ 21], StarCoder [ 12], Alpaca [ 22],\nVicuna [ 23], and WizardLM [ 24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25–35].\n⇤Equal contribution.

对于金棺中这个人，他是生是死，实在引不起青樱过多的悲喜。他，不过是自己夫君的父亲，王朝的先帝，甚至，遗弃了自己表姑母的男人。\n  \n        想到这里，青樱不觉打了个寒噤，又隐隐有些欢喜。一朝王府成潜龙府邸，自己的夫君君临天下，皆是拜这个男人之死所赐。这样的念头一转，青樱悄然抬眸望向别的妻妾格格——不，如今都是妃嫔了，只是名分未定而已。\n  \n        青樱一凛，复又低眉顺眼按着位序跪在福晋身后，身后是与她平起平坐的高晞月，一样的浑身缟素，一样的梨花带雨，不胜哀戚。\n  \n        忽然，前头微微有些骚动起来，有侍女低声惊呼起来：“主子娘娘晕过去了！”\n  \n        青樱跪在前头，立时膝行上前，跟着扶住晕过去的富察氏。高晞月也跟着上来，惶急道：“主子娘娘跪了一夜，怕是累着了。快去通报皇上和太后。”\n  \n        这个时候，太后和皇上都已疲乏，早在别宫安置了。青樱看了晞月一眼，朗声向众人道：“主子娘娘伤心过度，快扶去偏殿休息。素心，你是伺候主子娘娘的人，你去通报一声，说这边有咱们伺候就是了，不必请皇上和太后两宫再漏夜赶来。”\n  \n        晞月横了青樱一眼，不欲多言。青樱亦懒得和她争辩，先扶住了富察氏，等着眼明手快的小太监抬了软轿来，一齐拥着富察氏进了偏殿。\n  \n        晞月意欲跟进伺候，青樱身姿一晃，侧身拦住，轻声道：“这里不能没有人主持，太后和太妃们都去歇息了，主子娘娘和我进去，姐姐就是位分最高的侧福晋。”\n  \n        晞月眼眸如波，朝着青樱浅浅一漾，温柔的眼眸中闪过一丝不驯，她柔声细语：“妹妹与我都是侧福晋，我怎敢不随侍在主子娘娘身边？”她顿一顿，“而且，主子娘娘醒来，未必喜欢看见妹妹。”\n  \n        青樱笑而不语，望着她淡然道：“姐姐自然是明白的。”\n  \n        晞月微微咬一咬唇：“我希望自己永远都能明白。”\n  \n        她退后两步，复又跪下，朝着先帝的金棺哀哀痛哭，仿似清雨梨花，低下柔枝，无限凄婉。\n  \n        青樱在转入帘幕之前望了她一眼，亦不觉叹然，怎么会有这样的女人？轻柔得如同一团薄雾轻云，连伤心亦是，美到让人不忍移目。\n  \n        青樱转到偏殿中，素心和莲心已经将富察氏扶到榻上躺着，一边一个替富察氏擦着脸扑着扇子。青樱连忙吩咐了随侍的太监，叮嘱道：“立刻打了热水来，虽在九月里，别让主子娘娘擦脸着了凉。莲心，你伺候主子娘娘用些温水，仔细别烫着了。”说罢又吩咐自己的侍女，“惢心，你去开了窗透气，那么多人闷着，只怕娘娘更难受。太医已经去请了吧？”\n  \n        惢心连忙答应：“是。已经打发人悄悄去请了。”\n  \n        素心闻言，不觉双眉微挑，问道：“主子娘娘身子不适，怎么请个太医还要鬼鬼祟祟的？”\n  \n        青樱含笑转脸：“姑娘不知道，不是鬼鬼祟祟的。而是方才高姐姐的话说坏了。”\n  \n        素心颇为不解，更是疑心：“说坏了？”\n  \n        青樱不欲与她多言，便走前几步看着太监们端了热水进来，惢心侧身在素心身边，温和而不失分寸：“方才月福晋说，主子娘娘是累着了才晕倒的……”\n  \n        素心还欲再问，富察氏已经悠悠醒转，轻嗽着道：“糊涂！”\n  \n        莲心一脸欢欣，替富察氏抚着心口道：“主子娘娘要不要再喝些水？哭了一夜也该润润喉咙了。”\n  \n        富察氏慢慢喝了一口水，便是不适也不愿乱了鬓发，顺手一抚，才慢慢坐直身子，叱道：“糊涂！还不请侧福晋坐下。”\n  \n        青樱闻得富察氏醒转，早已垂首侍立一边，恭声道：“主子娘娘醒了。”\n  \n        富察氏笑笑：“主子娘娘？这个称呼只有皇后才受得起，皇上还未行册封礼，这个称呼是不是太早了？”\n  \n        青樱不卑不亢：“主子娘娘明鉴。皇上已在先帝灵前登基，虽未正式册封皇后，可主子娘娘是皇上结发，自然是名正言顺的皇后。如今再称福晋不妥，直呼皇后却也没有旨意，只好折中先唤了主子娘娘。”青樱见富察氏只是不做声，便行了大礼，“主子娘娘万福金安。”\n  \n        富察氏也不叫起来，只是悠悠叹息了一声：“这样说来，我还叫你侧福晋，却是委屈你了。”\n  \n        青樱低着头：“侧福晋与格格受封妃嫔，皆由主子娘娘统领六宫裁决封赏。妾身此时的确还是侧福晋，主子娘娘并未委屈妾身。”\n  \n        富察氏笑了一笑，细细打量着青樱：“青樱，你就这般滴水不漏，一丝错缝儿也没有么？”\n  \n        青樱越发低头，柔婉道：“妾身没有过错得以保全，全托赖主子娘娘教导顾全。”\n  \n        富察氏凝神片刻，温和道：“起来吧。”又问，“素心，是月福晋在外头看着吧？”\n  \n        素心忙道：“是。”\n  \n        富察氏扫了殿中一眼，叹了口气：“是青福晋安排的吧？果然事事妥帖。”她见素心有些不服，看向青樱道，“你做得甚好，月福晋说我累了……唉，我当为后宫命妇表率，怎可在众人面前累晕了？只怕那些爱兴风作浪的小人，要在后头嚼舌根说我托懒不敬先帝呢。来日太后和皇上面前，我怎么担待得起？”\n  \n        青樱颔首：“妾身明白，主子娘娘是为先帝爷驾崩伤心过度才晕倒的。高姐姐也只是关心情切，才会失言。”\n  \n        富察氏微微松了口气：“总算你还明白事理。”她目光在青樱身上悠悠一荡，“只是，你处事一定要如此滴水不漏么？”\n  \n        青樱低声：“妾身伺候主子，不敢不尽心。”\n  \n        富察氏似赞非赞：“到底是乌拉那拉氏的后人，细密周到。”\n  \n        青樱隐隐猜到富察氏所指，只觉后背一凉，越发不敢多言。\n  \n        富察氏望着她，一言不发。青樱只觉得气闷难过，这样沉默相对，比在潜邸时妻妾间偶尔或明或暗的争斗更难过。\n  \n        空气如胶凝一般，莲心适时端上一碗参汤：“主子喝点参汤提提神，太医就快来了。”\n  \n        富察氏接过参汤，拿银匙慢慢搅着，神色稳如泰山：“如今进了宫，好歹也是一家人，你就不去看看景仁宫那位吗？”\n  \n        青樱道：“先帝驾崩，太后未有懿旨放景仁宫娘娘出宫行丧礼，妾身自然不得相见。”\n  \n        富察氏微微一笑，搁下参汤：“有缘，自然会相见的。”\n  \n        青樱越发不能接口。富察氏何曾见过她如此样子，心中微微得意，脸上气色也好看了些。\n  \n        二人正沉默着，外头击掌声连绵响起，正是皇帝进来前侍从通报的暗号，提醒着宫人们尽早预备着。\n  \n        果然皇帝先进来了。富察氏气息一弱，低低唤道：“皇上……”\n  \n        青樱行礼：“皇上万福金安。”\n  \n        皇帝也不看她，只抬了抬手，随口道：“起来吧。”\n  \n        青樱起身退到门外，扬一扬脸，殿中的宫女太监也跟了出来。\n  \n        皇帝快步走到榻边，按住富察氏的手：“琅，叫你受累了。”\n  \n        富察氏眼中泪光一闪，柔情愈浓：“是臣妾无能，叫皇上担心了。”\n  \n        皇帝温声道：“你生了永琏与和敬之后身子一直弱，如今既要主持丧仪，又要看顾后宫诸事，是让你劳累了。”\n  \n        富察氏有些虚弱，低低道：“晞月和青樱两位妹妹，很能帮着臣妾。”\n  \n        皇帝拍拍她的手背：“那就好。”皇帝指一指身后，“朕听说你不适，就忍不住来了，正好也催促太医过来，给你仔细瞧瞧。”\n  \n        富察氏道：“多谢皇上关爱。”\n  \n        青樱在外头侍立，一时也不敢走远，只想着皇帝的样子，方才惊鸿一瞥，此刻倒是清清楚楚印在了脑子里。\n  \n        因着居丧，皇帝并未剃发去须，两眼也带着血丝，想是没睡好。想到此节，青樱不觉心疼，悄声向惢心道：“皇上累着了，怕是虚火旺，你去炖些银耳莲子羹，每日送去皇上宫里。记着，要悄悄儿的。”\n  \n        惢心答应着退下。恰巧皇帝带了人出来，青樱复又行礼：“恭送皇上，皇上万安。”\n  \n        皇帝瞥了随侍一眼，那些人何等聪明，立刻站在原地不动，如泥胎木偶一般。皇帝上前两步，青樱默然跟上。皇帝方悄然道：“朕是不是难看了？”\n  \n        青樱想笑，却不敢做声，只得咬唇死死忍住。二人对视一眼，青樱道：“皇上保重。”\n  \n        皇帝正好也说：“青樱，你保重。”\n  \n        青樱心中一动，不觉痴痴望着皇帝。皇帝回头看一眼，亦是柔情：“朕还要去前头，你别累着自己。”\n  \n        青樱道了声“是”。见皇帝走远了，御驾的随侍也紧紧跟上，只觉心头骤暖，慢慢微笑出来。\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n第二章 自处\n\n  \n        外头的月光乌蒙蒙的，暗淡得不见任何光华，青樱低低说：“怕是要下雨了呢。”\n  \n        惢心关切道：“小主站在廊檐下吧，万一掉下雨珠子来，怕凉着了您。”\n  \n        正巧素心引着太医出来，太医见了青樱，打了个千儿道：“给小主请安。”\n  \n        青樱点点头：“起来吧。主子娘娘凤体无恙吧？”\n  \n        太医忙道：“主子娘娘万安，只是操持丧仪连日辛劳，又兼伤心过度，才会如此。只须养几日，就能好了。”\n  \n        青樱客气道：“有劳太医了。”\n  \n        素心道：“太医快请吧，娘娘还等着你的方子和药呢。”\n  \n        太医诺诺答应了，素心转过脸来，朝着青樱一笑，话也客气了许多：“回小主的话，主子娘娘要在里头歇息了，怕今夜不能再去大殿主持丧仪。主子娘娘说了，一切有劳小主了。”\n  \n        青樱听她这样说，知是富察氏知晓晞月不堪重用，只管托赖了自己应对，忙道：“请主子娘娘安心养息。”\n  \n        青樱回到殿中，满殿缟素之下的哭泣声已经微弱了许多，大约跪哭了一日，凭谁也都累了。青樱吩咐殿外的宫女：“几位年长的宗亲福晋怕挨不得熬夜之苦，你们去御膳房将炖好的参汤拿来请福晋们饮些，若还有支持不住的，就请到偏殿歇息，等子时大哭时再请过来。”\n  \n        宫女们都答应着下去了，晞月在内殿瞧见，脸上便有些不悦。青樱进来，便道：“方才要妹妹替主子娘娘主持一切，实在是辛苦妹妹了。”\n  \n        晞月也不做声，只淡淡道：“你一句一句妹妹叫得好生顺口，其实论年岁算，我还虚长了你七岁呢。”\n  \n        青樱知她所指，只是在潜邸之中，她原是位序第一的侧福晋，名分分明，原不在年纪上。当下也不理会，只微微笑道：“是么？”\n  \n        晞月见她不以为意，不觉隐隐含怒，别过脸去不肯再和她说话。\n  \n        过了一个时辰，便是大哭的时候了。合宫寂静，人人忍着困意提起了精神，生怕哀哭不力，便落了个“不敬先帝”的罪名。执礼太监高声喊道：“举哀——”众人等着嫔妃们领头跪下，便可放声大哭了。\n  \n        因着富察氏不在，青樱哀哀哭了起来，正预备第一个跪下去。谁知站在她身侧一步的晞月抢先跪了下去，哀哀恸哭起来。\n  \n        晞月原本声音柔美，一哭起来愈加清婉悠亮，颇有一唱三叹之效，十分哀戚。连远远站在外头伺候的杂役小太监们，亦不觉心酸起来。\n  \n        按着在潜邸的位分次序，便该是晞月在青樱之后，谁知晞月横刺里闯到了青樱前头放声举哀，事出突然，众人一时都愣在了那里。\n  \n        潜邸的格格苏绿筠更是张口结舌，忍不住轻声道：“月福晋，这……青福晋的位次，是在您之上啊。”\n  \n        晞月根本不理会苏氏的话，只纹丝不动，跪着哭泣。\n  \n        青樱当众受辱，心中暗自生怒，只硬生生忍着不做声。惢心已经变了脸色，正要上前说话，青樱暗暗拦住，看了跟在身后的格格苏绿筠一眼，慢慢跪了下去。\n  \n        绿筠会意，即刻随着青樱跪下，身后的格格们一个跟着一个，然后是亲贵福晋、诰命夫人、宫女太监，随着晞月举起右手侧耳伏身行礼，齐声哭了起来。\n  \n        哀痛声声里，青樱盯着晞月举起的纤柔手腕，半露在重重缟素衣袖间的一串翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯在烛火中透着莹然如春水的光泽，刺得她双目发痛。青樱随着礼仪俯下身体，看着自己手腕上一模一样的镯子，死死地咬住了嘴唇。\n  \n        待到礼毕，已子时过半，晞月先起身环视众人，道了声：“今日暂去歇息，明日行礼，请各位按时到来。”如此，众人依序退去，青樱扶着酸痛的双膝起身，扶了惢心的手，一言不发就往外走。\n  \n        格格苏绿筠一向胆小怕事，默然撇开侍女的手，紧紧跟了过来。\n  \n        青樱心中有气，出了殿门连软轿都不坐，脚下越走越快，直走到了长街深处。终于，惢心亦忍不住，唤道：“小主，小主歇歇脚吧。”\n  \n        青樱缓缓驻足，换了口气，才隐隐觉得脚下酸痛。一回头却见绿筠鬓发微蓬，娇喘吁吁，才知自己情急之下走得太快，连绿筠跟在身后也没发觉。\n  \n        青樱不觉苦笑，柔声道：“你生下三阿哥才三个多月，这样跟着我疾走，岂不伤了身子？”青樱见她身姿孱孱，愈加不忍，“是我不好，没察觉你跟着我来了。”\n  \n        绿筠怯怯：“侧福晋言重了，我的身子不相干。倒是今日……高姐姐如此失礼，可怎生是好？”\n  \n        青樱正要说话，却见潜邸格格金玉妍坐在软轿上翩跹而来。\n  \n        金玉妍下了软轿，扶着侍女的手走近，笑吟吟道：“怎生是好？这样的大事，总有皇上和主子娘娘知道的时候，何况还有太后呢。侧福晋今日受的委屈，还怕没得报仇么？”\n  \n        青樱和缓道：“自家姐妹，有什么报仇不报仇的，玉妍妹妹言重了。”\n  \n        金玉妍福了一福，又与苏绿筠见了平礼，方腻声道：“妹妹也觉得奇怪，高姐姐一向温柔可人，哪怕从前在潜邸中也和侧福晋置气，却也不至如此。难道一进宫中，人人的脾气都见长了么？”\n  \n        绿筠忙道：“何人脾气见长了？玉妍妹妹得皇上宠爱，可以随口说笑，咱们却不敢。”\n  \n        玉妍媚眼如丝，轻俏道：“姐姐说到宠爱二字，妹妹就自愧不如了。现放着侧福晋呢，皇上对侧福晋才是万千宠爱。”她故作沉吟，“哎呀！难道高姐姐是想着，进了紫禁城，侧福晋会与景仁宫那位一家团聚，会失幸于皇上和太后，才会如此不敬？”\n  \n        青樱略略正色：“先帝驾崩，正是国孝家孝于一身的时候，这会子说什么宠爱不宠爱的，是不是错了时候？”\n  \n        绿筠忙收了神色，恭身站在一旁。玉妍托着腮，笑盈盈道：“侧福晋好气势，只是这样的气势，若是方才能对着高姐姐发一发，也算让高姐姐知道厉害了呢。”玉妍屈膝道，“夜深人困倦，才进宫就有这样的好戏，日后还怕会少么？妹妹先告辞，养足了精神等着看呢。”\n  \n        玉妍扬长而去，绿筠看她如此，不觉皱了皱眉。\n  \n        青樱劝道：“罢了。你不是不知道金玉妍的性子，虽说是和你一样的格格位分，在潜邸的资历也不如你，但她是朝鲜宗室的女儿，先帝特赐了皇上的，咱们待她总要客气些，无须和她生气。”\n  \n        绿筠愁眉不展：“姐姐说得是，我何尝不知道呢？如今皇上为了她的身份好听些，特特又指了上驷院的三保大人做她义父，难怪她更了不得了。”\n  \n        青樱安慰道：“我知道你与她住一块儿，难免有些不顺心。等皇上册封了六宫，迟早会给你们安置更好的宫殿。你放心，你才生了三阿哥，她总越不过你去的。”\n  \n        绿筠忧心忡忡地看着青樱：“月福晋在皇上面前最温柔、善解人意，如今一进宫，连她也变了性子，还有什么是不能的？”绿筠望着长街甬道，红墙高耸，直欲压人而下，不觉瑟缩了细柔的肩，“常道紫禁城怨魂幽心，日夜作祟，难道变人心性，就这般厉害么？”\n  \n        这样乌深的夜，月光隐没，连星子也不见半点。只见殿脊重重叠叠如远山重峦，有倾倒之势，更兼宫中处处点着大丧的白纸灯笼，如鬼火点点，来往皆白衣素裳，当真凄凄如鬼魅之地。\n  \n        青樱握了握绿筠的手，温和道：“子不语怪力乱神。绿筠你好歹还痴长我几岁，怎么倒来吓我呢？何况高晞月的温柔，那是对着皇上，可从不是对着我们。”\n  \n        绿筠闻言，亦不觉含笑。\n  \n        青樱望着这陌生的紫禁城，淡然道：“你我虽都是紫禁城的儿媳，常常入宫请安，可真正住在这里，却也还是头一回。至于这里是否有怨魂幽心，我想，变人心性，总是人比鬼更厉害些吧。”\n  \n        毕竟劳碌终日，二人言罢也就散去了。\n  \n        晞月回到宫中，已觉得困倦难当。晞月在和合福仙梨木桌边坐下，立时有宫女端了红枣燕窝上来，恭声道：“小主累了，用点燕窝吧。”\n  \n        晞月扬了扬脸示意宫女放下，随手拔下头上几支银簪子递到心腹侍婢茉心手中，口中道：“什么劳什子！暗沉沉的，又重，压得我脑仁疼。”说罢摸着自己腕上碧莹莹的翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯，“还好这镯子是主子娘娘赏的，哪怕守丧也不必摘下。否则整天看着这些黯沉颜色，人也没了生气。”\n  \n        茉心接过簪子放在妆台上，又替晞月将鬓边的白色绢花和珍珠压鬓摘下，笑道：“小主天生丽质，哪怕是簪了乌木簪子，也是艳冠群芳。何况这镯子虽然一样都有，小主戴着就是比青福晋好看。”\n  \n        晞月瞥她一眼，笑吟吟道：“就会说嘴。艳冠群芳？现放着金玉妍呢，皇上可不是宠爱她芳姿独特？”\n  \n        茉心笑：“再芳姿独特也不过是个小国贱女，算什么呢？主子娘娘体弱，苏绿筠性子怯懦，剩下的几个格格侍妾都入不得眼，唯一能与小主平起平坐的，不过一个乌拉那拉青樱。只是如今小主已经作了筏子给她瞧了，看她还能得意多久！”\n  \n        晞月慢慢舀了两口燕窝，轻浅笑道：“从前她总仗着是先帝孝敬皇后和景仁宫皇后的表侄女儿，又是先帝和太后指婚给皇上的，得意过了头。如今太后得势，先帝与孝敬皇后都已作古，景仁宫那位反倒成了她的累赘了。想来太后和皇上也不会再敷衍她。”\n  \n        茉心替晞月捶着肩道：“可不是么，奴婢瞧主子娘娘也不愿看她。”\n  \n        晞月叹口气：“从前虽然都是侧福晋，我又比她年长，可是我进府时才是格格，虽然后来封了侧福晋，可旁人眼里到底觉着我不如她，明里暗里叫我受了多少气？同样这个镯子，原是一对的，偏要我和她一人一个，形单影只的，也不如一对在一起好看。”\n  \n        茉心想着自己小主的前程，也颇痛快：“可不是。小主手腕纤细白皙，最适合戴翡翠了。也是她从前得意罢了，如今给了她个下马威，也算让她知道了。侧福晋有什么要紧，要紧的是在后宫的位分、皇上的宠爱。”\n  \n        晞月柔婉一笑，嘉许地看了茉心一眼，又不免有些忧心：“我今日在哭灵时这样做，实在冒险。你的消息可确实么？”\n  \n        茉心笑道：“小主放一百二十个心，是主子娘娘身边的莲心亲口来告诉奴婢的，说是听见皇上与主子娘娘说的。给莲心一万个胆子，她也不敢撒这样的弥天大谎啊！”\n  \n        晞月闭上秀美狭长的凤眼，笑道：“那就好了。”\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n第三章 风雨\n\n  \n        夜深。\n  \n        殿中富察氏正喝药，莲心伺候在旁，接过富察氏喝完的药碗，又递过清水伺候她漱口。方漱了口，素心便奉上蜜饯，道：“这是新腌制的甜酸杏子，主子尝一个，去去嘴里的苦味儿。”\n  \n        富察氏吃了一颗，正要合着被子躺下，忽地仿佛听到什么，惊起身来，侧耳凝神道：“是不是永琏在哭？是不是？”\n  \n        素心忙道：“主子万安，二阿哥在阿哥所呢，这个时候正睡得香。”\n  \n        富察氏似有不信，担心道：“真的？永琏认床，怕生，他夜里又爱哭。”素心道：“就为二阿哥认床，主子不是嘱咐乳母把潜邸时二阿哥睡惯的床挪到了阿哥所么？宫里又足足添了十六个乳母嬷嬷照应，断不会有差池的。”\n  \n        富察氏松了口气：“那就好。只是那些乳母嬷嬷，都是靠得住的吧？还有，大阿哥也住在阿哥所……”\n  \n        素心微笑：“主子娘娘的安排，哪次不是妥妥帖帖的？大阿哥虽然也住在阿哥所，但和咱们二阿哥怎么能比？”\n  \n        富察氏点点头：“大阿哥的生母虽然和我同宗，却这样没福，偏在皇上登基前就过世了，丢下大阿哥孤零零一个。”她婉转看了素心一眼，“你吩咐阿哥所，对大阿哥也要用心看顾，别欺负了这没娘的孩子。”\n  \n        素心含笑：“奴婢明白，知道怎么做。”\n  \n        富察氏似乎还不安心，有些辗转反侧。莲心放下水墨青花帐帷，苦口婆心劝道：“主子安置吧，睡不了几个时辰又得起来主持丧仪。今夜您不在，大殿里可不知闹成什么样子了呢。”\n  \n        富察氏微微一笑，有些疲倦地伏在枕上，一把瀑布似的青丝蜿蜒下柔婉的弧度，如她此刻的语气一般：“是啊。可不知要闹成什么样子呢？尚未册封嫔妃，她们就都按捺不住性子了么？”\n  \n        莲心淡然道：“由得她们闹去，只要主子娘娘是皇后，凭谁都闹不起来。”\n  \n        富察氏淡淡一笑：“闹不起来？在潜邸时就一个个乌眼鸡似的，如今只怕闹得更厉害吧。”她翻了个身，朝里头睡了，“只是她们耐不住性子爱闹，就由着她们闹去吧。”\n  \n        富察氏不再说话，莲心放下帐帘，素心吹熄了灯，只留了一盏亮着，两人悄然退了出去。\n  \n        青樱回到宫中，只仿若无事人一般。陪嫁侍婢阿箬满脸含笑迎了上来：“小主辛苦了。奴婢已经准备好热水，伺候小主洗漱。”\n  \n        青樱点点头不说话，抬眼见阿箬样样准备精当，一应服侍的宫女捧着金盆栉巾肃立一旁，静默无声，不觉讶异道：“何必这样大费周章？按着潜邸的规矩简单洗漱便是了。”\n  \n        阿箬笑盈盈靠近青樱，极力压抑着喜悦之情，一脸隐秘：“自小主入了潜邸，皇上最宠爱的就是您，哪怕是福晋主子也比不上。高小主虽然也是侧福晋，但她起先不过是个格格，后来才被封的侧福晋，如何比得上您尊贵荣耀？”\n  \n        惢心淡淡看她一眼：“好端端的，你和小主说起这个做什么？”\n  \n        阿箬笑意愈浓，颇为自得：“大阿哥是富察诸瑛格格生的，诸瑛格格早就弃世而去，那就不提。福晋主子生了二阿哥，将来自然是皇后，但得不得宠却难说。苏小主有了三阿哥，却和高小主一样，是汉军旗出身，那可不行了。”\n  \n        青樱慢慢拨着鬓角一朵雪白的珠花。银质的护甲触动珠花轻滑有声，指尖却慢慢沁出汗来，连摸着光润的珍珠都觉得艰涩。青樱不动声色：“那又怎样呢？”\n  \n        阿箬只顾欢喜，根本未察觉青樱的神色：“所以呀，小主一定会被封为仅次于皇后的皇贵妃，位同副后。再不济，总也一定是贵妃之位。若等小主生下皇子，太子之位还指不定是谁的呢……”\n  \n        青樱望着窗外深沉夜色，紫禁城乌漆漆的夜晚让人觉得陌生而不安，檐下的两盏白灯笼更是在夜风中晃得让人发慌。青樱打断阿箬：“好了。有这嘴上的功夫，不如去倒杯茶来我喝。”\n  \n        惢心机警：“小主今日哭久了，怕是口渴得厉害。”\n  \n        阿箬喜滋滋正要离去，青樱忍不住喊住她：“先帝驾崩，你脸上那些喜色给人瞧见，十条命都不够你去抵罪的，还当是在潜邸里么？”\n  \n        阿箬吓得一哆嗦，赶紧收敛神色，诺诺退下。青樱微微蹙眉：“这样沉不住气……惢心，你看着她些，别让她失了分寸惹祸。”\n  \n        惢心点头：“是。阿箬是直肠子，不懂得收敛形色。”\n  \n        青樱扫一眼侍奉的宫人，淡淡道：“我不喜欢那么多人伺候，你们下去，惢心伺候就是。”\n  \n        众人退了出去。\n  \n        青樱叹口气，抚着头坐下。哭得久了，哪怕没有感情投入，都觉得体乏头痛，无奈道：“在潜邸无论怎样，关起门来就那么点子大，皇上宠我，难免下人奴才们也有些失分寸。如今可不一样了，紫禁城这样大，到处都是眼睛耳朵，再这样由着阿箬，可是要不安生。”\n  \n        惢心点头道：“奴婢明白，会警醒宫中所有的口舌，不许行差踏错。”\n  \n        青樱颔首，便由着惢心伺候了浸手，外头小太监道：“启禀小主，海兰小主来了。”\n  \n        因着海兰抱病，今日并未去大殿行哭礼，青樱见她立在门外，便道：“这样夜了怎么还来？着了风寒更不好了，快进来罢。”\n  \n        海兰温顺点了头，进来请了安道：“睡了半宿出了身汗，觉得好多了。听见侧福晋回来，特意来请安，否则心中总是不安。”\n  \n        青樱笑道：“你在我房中住着也有日子了，何必还这样拘束。惢心，扶海兰小主起来坐。”\n  \n        海兰诚惶诚恐道了“不敢”，小心翼翼觑着青樱道：“听闻，今夜高晞月又给姐姐气受了。”\n  \n        青樱“哦”一声：“你身上病着，她们还不让你安生，非把这些话传到你耳朵里来。”\n  \n        海兰慌忙站起：“妾身不敢。”\n  \n        青樱微笑：“我是怕你又操心，养不好身子。”\n  \n        海兰谦恭道：“妾身是跟着小主的屋里人，承蒙小主眷顾，才能在潜邸有一席容身之地，如何敢不为小主分担？”\n  \n        青樱温和道：“你坐下吧，站得急了又头晕。”\n  \n        海兰这才坐下，谦卑道：“在小主面前，妾身不敢不直言。在潜邸时月福晋虽然难免与小主有些龃龉，但从未如此张扬过。事出突然，怕有什么变故。”她抬眼望青樱一眼，低声道，“幸好，小主隐忍。”\n  \n        青樱默然片刻，方道：“高晞月忽然性情大变，连金玉妍都会觉得奇怪。可是只有你，会与我说隐忍二字。”\n  \n        海兰道：“小主聪慧，怎会不知高晞月素日温婉过人，如今分明是要越过小主去。这样公然羞辱小主，本不该纵容她，只是……”\n  \n        “只是情势未明，而且后宫位分未定，真要责罚她，自然有皇上与皇后。再如何受辱，我都不能发作，坏了先帝丧仪。”\n  \n        海兰望着青樱，眼中尽是赞许钦佩之意：“小主顾虑周全。”她欲言又止，似有什么话一时说不出口。青樱与她相处不是一两日了，便道：“有什么话，你尽管说就是。这里没有外人。”\n  \n        海兰绞着绢子，似乎有些不安：“妾身今日本好些了，原想去看望主子娘娘的病情。谁知到了那儿，听娘娘身边的莲心和素心趁着去端药的空儿在说闲话。说月福晋的父亲江南河道总督高斌高大人甚得皇上倚重，皇上是说要给高氏一族抬旗呢？”\n  \n        青樱脑中轰然一响，喃喃道：“抬旗？”\n  \n        海兰脸上的忧色如同一片阴郁的乌云，越来越密：“可不是！妾身虽然低微，但也是秀女出身，这些事知道一星半点。圣祖康熙爷的生母孝康皇太后的佟氏一族就是大清开国以来第一个抬旗的。那可无上荣耀啊！”\n  \n        青樱郁然道：“的确是无上荣耀。高晞月是汉军旗，一旦抬旗，那就是满军旗了。她原本也就是出身上不如我一些，这一来若是真的，可就大大越过我去了。”\n  \n        海兰有些忧心：“人人以为小主在潜邸时受尽恩宠，福泽深厚。如今妾身看来，怕却是招祸多于纳福。还请小主万事小心。”她微微黯然，“这些话不中听……”\n  \n        青樱微微有些动容：“虽然不中听，却是一等一的好话。海兰，多谢你。”\n  \n        海兰眸中一动，温然道：“小主的大恩，妾身永志不忘。妾身先告辞了。”\n  \n        青樱看海兰身影隐没于夜色之中，不觉有些沉吟：“惢心，你瞧海兰这个人……”\n  \n        惢心道：“她在小主身边也有些年，若论恭谨、规矩，再没有比得上她的人了，何况又这样懂事，事事都以小主为先。”\n  \n        青樱凝神想了想：“仿佛是。可真是这样规矩的人，怎会对宫中大小事宜这样留神？”\n  \n        惢心不以为意：“正是因为事事留神，才能谨慎不出错呀。”\n  \n        青樱一笑：“这话虽是说她，你也得好好学着才是。”\n  \n        惢心道：“是。”\n  \n        青樱起身走到妆镜前，由惢心伺候着卸妆：“可惜了，这样的性子，这样的品貌，却只被皇上宠幸过两三回，这么些年，也算委屈她了。”\n  \n        惢心摇头：“小主抬举她了。海兰小主是什么出身？她阿玛额尔吉图是丢了官被革职的员外郎。当年她虽是内务府送来潜邸的秀女，可是这样的身份，不过是在绣房伺候的侍女，若不是皇上偶尔宠幸了她一回，您还求着皇上给了她一个侍妾的名分，才被人称呼一声格格，今日早被皇上丢在脑后了，还不知是什么田地呢。”\n  \n        青樱从镜中看了惢心一眼：“这样的话，别浑说。眼看着皇上要大封潜邸旧人，海兰是一定会有名分的，你再这样说，便是不敬主上了。”\n  \n        惢心有些畏惧：“奴婢知道，宫里比不得府里。”\n  \n        青樱望着窗外深沉如墨的夜色，又念着海兰刚才那番话，慢慢叹了口气。\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n第四章 直言\n\n  \n        这日清晨起来，青樱匆匆梳洗完毕，便去富察氏宫中伺候。为了起居便于主持丧仪诸事，富察琅嬅便一直住在就近的偏殿。\n  \n        青樱去时天色才放亮，素心打了帘子迎了青樱进去，笑道：“青福晋来得好早。主子娘娘才起来呢。”\n  \n        青樱谦和笑道：“我是该早些伺候主子娘娘起身的。”\n  \n        里头帘子掀起，伺候洗漱的宫女捧着栉巾鱼贯而出。青樱知道富察氏洗漱已毕，该伺候梳妆了。\n  \n        素心朝里头轻声道：“主子，青福晋来了。”\n  \n        只闻得温婉一声：“请进来吧。”\n  \n        两边侍女双手掀帘，半曲腰身，低眉颔首迎了青樱进去。青樱不觉暗赞，即便是国丧，富察氏这里的规矩也是丝毫不错。\n  \n        青樱进去时，富察氏正端坐在镜前，由专门的梳头嬷嬷伺候着梳好了发髻。富察氏与皇帝年龄相当，自是端然生姿的华年。简简单单一方青玉无缀饰的扁方，也显得她格外清淡宜人，如一枝迎风的白木兰，素虽素，却是庄静宜人。\n  \n        青樱请了安，富察氏笑着回头：“起来吧。难得你来得早。”\n  \n        青樱起身谢过，富察氏指着镜台上一个个打开的饰盒，道：“丧中不宜珠饰过多，但太清简了也叫人笑话。你向来眼力好，也来替我选选。”\n  \n        青樱笑：“主子娘娘什么好东西没见过？不过是考考妾身眼力罢了。”\n  \n        富察氏微笑不语，青樱拣了一枚点翠银凤含珠的步摇比了比，道：“今日是举哀的最后一日，明日就是正式的登基大典。主子娘娘虽然是素装，也得戴些亮眼的首饰。这步摇凤带翠羽，凤凰的眼珠子也是蓝宝珠子，再配上几朵蓝宝的珍珠花儿，最端雅不过，也还素净。”\n  \n        富察氏向梳头嬷嬷笑道：“还不按青福晋说的做。”\n  \n        青樱退开一步守着，只在旁伺候着递东西。富察氏看在眼里，也不言语。待到梳妆完毕，才慢慢笑说：“好好儿的侧福晋，倒为我做起这些微末功夫，可委屈你了。”\n  \n        青樱忙道：“妾身不敢。”\n  \n        富察氏对着镜子照了又照，笑道：“你配的珠饰，真真是挑不出错处来。若为人处世都能无可挑剔，那也算是福慧双修的人了。”富察氏闭目片刻，正色道，“你这个人，终究是委屈了。”\n  \n        青樱不知富察氏所指，慌忙跪下道：“妾身愚钝，不明娘娘所指，还请娘娘指教。”\n  \n        富察氏看了她两眼，慢慢说：“你怎么嫁进王府成了侧福晋的，你自己清楚。”\n  \n        青樱跪在地上，终究不知该如何说起，只好低头不敢做声。\n  \n        富察氏看她一味低头，慢慢露出笑意，道：“你我姐妹一场，我才这样问你。你这个人，终究是成也萧何，最怕败也萧何。也难怪高氏要处处抢你的风头。”\n  \n        青樱勉强微笑：“妾身与月福晋一同伺候皇上，说不上谁抢了谁的风头。妾身若有不如人的，高姐姐合该指教。”\n  \n        富察氏淡淡笑一声：“指教？从前在王府里，她敢指教你么？如今时移世易，你又该如何自处呢？”\n  \n        青樱闻言，不觉冷汗涔涔，轻声道：“主子娘娘……”\n  \n        富察氏凝视她片刻，又复了往日端雅贤惠的神色，柔声道：“好了。我不过提醒你一句罢了，事情也未必坏到如此地步。”富察氏略略自矜，“到底我也是皇后，皇上的结发嫡妻，若是你安分守己，我也不容高氏再欺负了你去。”\n  \n        青樱听得如此，只得谢恩：“多谢主子娘娘。主子娘娘一向对我和姐姐一视同仁，我能倚仗的，也只有主子娘娘了。”\n  \n        富察氏的目光悠悠在她手腕上一荡，看青樱皓腕上除了一串翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯外，别无其他饰物，不由得暗暗颔首：“你手腕上这串镯子，还是皇上为皇子的时候安南国进贡的珍品，一共只有一对。当时先帝赐给了咱们府里。我想着你和高氏是平起平坐的，便一人一个给了你们。既是让你们彼此间存了亲好之心，也是要你们明白，同为侧福晋，应当不分彼此，不要凡事计较。如今你倒还肯天天戴着，也算不枉了我的一片心。”\n  \n        这一只镯子，原是安南国极稀罕的贡品。安南本出好翡翠，但如这一对的，真真是罕见。一串碧绿翡翠珠颗颗一样大小，通透温润不说，更难得的是竟然均匀得没有半点杂色，碧幽幽的恍若一汪流动的绿水。若拿到阳光下照着，便会出现一纹一纹水波似的莹白光痕，如同孔雀翎羽一般。因这翡翠珠碧色沉沉，所以特配了赤金缠丝花叶护着珠子周身，每颗翡翠珠的两端各用薄薄的莲花状金片裹住，更是一份匠心独运。\n  \n        皇帝当年还是四皇子，得到这对镯子，也是欣喜异常，虽然宠爱两位新婚的侧福晋，但还是送给了嫡福晋富察氏。富察氏体念皇帝的心意，收下不过几天，便转赠给了青樱和晞月。\n  \n        青樱低首，爱惜地抚着镯子，一脸安分随和：“主子娘娘说得是。真是感念娘娘这份心意，所以如娘娘当年的嘱咐，时时戴着，时时警醒。”\n  \n        富察氏柔和道：“你是个懂事的。我看高氏也天天戴着，却也未必记得这层意思了。”她顿一顿，“唉，昨夜高氏僭越，我不是不知，只是从今以后，你也只得让着她了。”青樱心中想着海兰昨夜所言，正要说话，却听富察氏道：“你来之前皇上已经有了口谕，为高氏抬旗，抬的可是镶黄旗，又赐姓高佳氏。大清开国百年，能得皇上亲口抬旗，获此殊荣的，只有高氏一人，且只有正黄和镶黄两旗是天子亲信，这里面的分量，你可掂量清楚了吧？”\n  \n        青樱心中悸动，想要说话，却只惊异得口舌麻木，一个字也说不出来，只得诺诺含笑。\n  \n        富察氏回转头在首饰匣里闲闲挑出一双玲珑蓝宝坠耳环，口中道：“从前府中，你的地位自然比高氏矜贵，如今看来，她竟是要跟你比肩了。唉……你先跪安吧。”\n  \n        青樱慢慢走出富察氏殿中，只觉得口干舌燥，仿佛从未如此烦恼过。连当初……当初被三阿哥弘时回绝羞辱，也不曾如此。\n  \n        她脑中想到“弘时”二字，只觉厌烦，用力摆了摆头，扶了惢心的手慢慢出去。\n  \n        炎夏暑气退散，偶尔一两阵风来，也隐隐有了清凉之气。前头隐约有人说笑着过来，青樱皱了皱眉，正要说话，却见高晞月与金玉妍亲亲热热过来。见了青樱，金玉妍倒还是如常退开半步，屈膝行礼，高晞月却只笑吟吟望着青樱：“妹妹好早啊。”\n  \n        高晞月这般直呼“妹妹”想来是有备而来，潜邸中的身份，如今已是变了。青樱自知情势不同往日，先与晞月见了个平礼，方含笑道：“来得早不如来得巧。主子娘娘梳洗完毕，进去正好呢。”\n  \n        晞月点点头，笑道：“入宫这几日，妹妹都还住得惯么？”\n  \n        青樱道：“劳姐姐费心，一切都好。”\n  \n        晞月颔首：“住得惯就好。我生怕妹妹睡惯了王府的热炕头，不习惯紫禁城的高床大枕，半夜醒来孤零零一个，冷不丁吓一跳呢。”\n  \n        青樱眉心微微一蹙，面上倒还笑着：“高姐姐惯会说笑。皇上为先帝守孝，这些日子都在养心殿住着，难不成姐姐还有皇上做伴么？”\n  \n        晞月居高临下瞥她一眼：“妹妹千伶百俐，以后可算棋逢敌手了。景仁宫的乌拉那拉皇后，大约会和妹妹一样有空，一同闲话家常呢。”她见青樱神色微微尴尬，走近一步低声道，“夹在皇太后和乌拉那拉皇后之间，妹妹与其有空争宠，不如想想，该如何自处是好呢。”\n  \n        说罢，高晞月向玉妍招了招手，亲热道：“杵在那儿做什么？还不跟我进去！”\n  \n        玉妍答了声“是”，瞟了青樱一眼，得意地挽上晞月的手，亲亲热热地进去了。\n  \n        有风贴着面刮过。京中九月的风，原来有如此隐隐透骨的凉意，会吹迷了人的眼睛。\n  \n        惢心待她们进去，扶住青樱的手慢慢往前走，低声愤愤道：“月福晋不过是和您一样的人，受了您的礼也不还礼，她……”\n  \n        青樱淡淡道：“这样的日子，以后多着呢。我若连这点气都受不住，就白和她相处这几年了。”青樱缓一口气，“何况，她到底年长我七岁，我敬她几分，听她教诲，也是应当的。只要她不过分也就是了。”\n  \n        惢心欲言又止，青樱看她一眼：“你想说什么？”\n  \n        惢心低眉顺眼：“小主这样说，也是知道月福晋那个人，不是我们让着，她就能不过分的。”\n  \n        青樱眉毛一挑，沉声道：“知道的事一定要说出来么？讷于言敏于行是你的好处，怎么和阿箬一样心直口快了？”\n  \n        惢心垂首不语，只伸出手来：“奴婢知错。小主，时辰到了，该去先帝灵前行礼了。”\n  \n        这一日灵前哭丧，晞月理所当然跪在青樱之前。富察氏一句言语都没有，反而待高氏比寻常更客气。殿中人最善见风使舵，一时间也改了昨日惊诧之情，待晞月更为恭敬。\n  \n        过了辰时三刻，太妃们一一入殿，与新帝的嫔妃们分列左右两侧，戚戚举哀。殿中人虽多，然而一眼而去，皆是素服银器，白霜霜的一片哀色。仿佛再有魂灵的一个人，也成了那素色中单薄的一点。不过半个时辰，太后乌雅氏扶着福姑姑的手也过来了。因着连日举哀，太后的神色不太好。太后是先帝的熹贵妃，一向深得宠爱，养尊处优，于保养功夫上也十分尽心，四十多岁的人，望之才如三十许之人。如今太后因着心境哀伤，为着先帝驾崩伤心得数日水米未进，整个人顿时枯槁了许多。仿佛那红颜盛时，一朝就花叶伶仃了。\n  \n        琅见太后进殿，忙领着众人行礼如仪。太后微微颔首：“行了。都是为先帝尽心尽孝的时候，也不必那么多规矩了。”\n  \n        琅忙应了声“是”，起身搀住太后。青樱一向与琅入宫觐见最多，便也踏出了一步想去扶住太后。哪知晞月往她手肘一撞，一步上前扶住了太后的另一只手，婉声道：“太后连日来疲倦了，未免哀思伤身，也应当注意凤体。”\n  \n        太后微微颔首，拍一拍晞月手背：“你有心了。”\n  \n        待得太后走近了，青樱才敢抬头看她。从前入宫相见，太后尚且是得宠的贵妃，虽有年轻的宁嫔与谦嫔后来居上，到底也是陪伴先帝多年的可心人，总是脂光水腻的精致妆容，不见丝毫懈怠。如今细细打量去，到底岁月无情，伴着忧伤无声无息地爬过她的皮肤，在她眉梢眼角碾上了细细的痕迹。太后脂粉轻薄的容颜憔悴暗淡，仿佛再好的丝缎，经久了时光，亦染上了轻黄的岁月痕迹，不复光洁平滑，只剩下脆薄易碎的小心。\n  \n        因着先帝去世，太后的装扮也素淡了许多。服丧的白袍底下露着银底缎子绣白色竹叶的素服，最清淡哀戚的颜色，袖口落着精致绵密的玄色并深青二色丝线捻了银线错丝绣的缠枝佛手花。散缀于发髻上的玉钿色泽光华，越发衬得一把青丝里藏不住的白发如刺眼的蓬草，一丝丝扎着人的眼睛。\n  \n        青樱心下恻然，随着太后与琅跪在灵前，凄凄然哀哭不已。\n  \n        哭灵的日子虽然乏倦，但真当自己是竖在灵前的一支烛台，或是被金丝细绳扎进了素白帷幔，时光倒也过得快了许多。\n  \n        到了午膳时分，因着绿筠诞育三阿哥永璋未久，太后特意准了她回去照看。绿筠感激万分，立刻去了。便由着琅、晞月和青樱到偏殿侍奉太后用午膳。\n  \n        太后的午膳本是要回寿康宫中用的。本朝的规矩，新帝不能与先帝嫔妃同居东西六宫。所以先帝过世，匆忙将六宫中一众遗妃都挪去了寿康宫中安置。太后也暂居在寿康宫正殿，并未搬去本应由太后独居的慈宁宫中。而这一日，本是为先帝举哀的最后一日，太后不愿车辇劳动，情愿多些时候为先帝尽哀，便嘱咐了御膳房将午膳挪在了偏殿。\n  \n        琅本打算趁着中午用膳去看看二阿哥永琏，但太后在此，本着孝道，她也尽心侍奉，一丝不错。一时间膳食上来，琅添饭，晞月布菜，青樱舀汤，伺候的人虽多，但一丝咳嗽声也不闻，静得如无人一般。\n  \n        太后见琅服侍在侧，不觉问：“二阿哥和三公主都还年幼，怎么你不回宫照拂，还要留在这里伺候哀家？”\n  \n        琅端然一笑：“太后有所不知，臣妾为了能尽心照拂好后宫诸事，按着祖宗规矩，已经将二阿哥送去阿哥所由嬷嬷照拂了。”\n  \n        太后微微一惊，似是颇为意外：“怎么？你不自己先照拂他两天，也不怕他住不惯阿哥所？”\n  \n        琅眉目恬静，仿佛安然承受：“本朝的家法，一旦生下阿哥公主，若有旨意，低位的嫔妃所出交给高位的嫔妃抚养；若无旨意，则一律交由阿哥所的嬷嬷们照管，以免母子过于情深，既不能安心伺候皇上，也误了再诞育皇嗣的机会。臣妾不敢不以身作则，所以二阿哥和大阿哥都送去了。”\n  \n        太后凝神片刻，缓声道：“那是难为你了。如此说来，苏氏的三阿哥也不宜留在身边教养了。福珈，吩咐下去，命格格苏氏尽快将三阿哥挪去阿哥所，也好让她专心伺候皇帝。”\n  \n        福姑姑答应了一声，吩咐下去，又转回太后身边伺候。\n  \n        太后用膳的规矩，一向是先饮一碗汤。青樱见桌上一道火腿鲜笋汤，雪白笋片配着鲜红火腿，汤汁金灿，引得人颇有胃口，便用如意头银勺舀了一勺在碗中，又夹了笋片递到太后身前放下。\n  \n        太后喝了一口，微微颔首：“论到汤饮，没有比上好的金华火腿配了笋片更吊鲜味的了。这汤鲜是鲜，笋片也做得嫩，只是鲜味都在前头了，后头的菜再好，总也觉得食之无味了。”\n  \n        伺候太后的福姑姑是经年的老嬷嬷了，忙笑道：“太后一向是喜欢这个汤的。但连日来为先帝哀思伤神，本就茶饭无味。如今鲜味一过嘴，后面怕更吃不下了。”\n  \n        青樱吓了一跳，忙跪下道：“臣妾只惦记着太后素日喜欢，竟未察觉太后当下的胃口，实在是臣妾的过失了。”\n  \n        晞月看青樱如此，忍不住冷笑一声，只作壁上观。\n  \n        琅亦道：“光是汤也罢了。笋片虽鲜嫩，但多食伤胃，于太后是不相宜的。”\n  \n        太后摆摆手，倦怠道：“算了。你也是一份孝心，是哀家自己没胃口罢了。”太后瞟一眼桌上的膳食，懒懒道，“叫人撤下去吧。哀家看了也没胃口。”\n  \n        晞月无声冷笑，徐徐道：“妹妹好一份孝心，太后这些日子饮食清减，好不容易用些午膳，才喝一口汤就被妹妹败了胃口。今日下午还有好几个时辰的哀仪，妹妹是打算让太后饿着身子熬在那儿么？”\n  \n        青樱咬了咬唇，忙跪下磕了头道：“还请太后恕罪，臣妾一时有失，不想连累了太后凤体。太后要责罚臣妾都无怨无悔，但请太后保养身体，多进一些吧。”\n  \n        太后神思懒懒，并不欲进食。琅见状，忙舀了一碗熬得极稠的粥来，拿银匙舀了轻轻吹着，递到太后手中：“太后再不想用膳，也请为了先帝着想，进一碗粥吧。”\n  \n        太后扬眸看了一眼，又懒懒闭上眼睛，厌道：“哀家没有胃口。”\n  \n        福姑姑微微蹙眉，轻声道：“主子娘娘，太后这几日胃口不好，顶多进一些熬得极薄的粥水，这么厚稠的粥，太后实在是没胃口吃。”\n  \n        琅并不气馁，笑吟吟道：“这种熬粥的米是御田里新进的，粒粒饱满，晶莹剔透，吃上去口感微甜，柔软却有嚼劲，最适合熬得稠稠的，却入口即化。皇上这几日伤心先帝驾崩，又忙着前朝的事情，也是没有胃口。儿臣嘱咐了御膳房做这样的粥，皇上倒能吃几口。”\n  \n        太后这才点点头：“你是皇帝的结发妻子，是该多多关心皇帝，免他操劳。”她顿一顿，“罢了，皇帝都在努力加餐饭，哀家再伤心，也得用一点了。就尝尝吧。”\n  \n        琅喜不自禁，看太后吃了两口，倒还落胃，便也放心些。晞月殷勤布菜，尽拣些清淡小菜，倒也看着太后将小半碗粥都喝了。\n  \n        琅方才露了几丝笑意，柔声道：“青樱妹妹的汤是鲜，配着淡粥小菜也能入口了，若是后面的菜还是浓鲜，那才真伤了胃口呢。”\n  \n        太后回味片刻：“你们有心了。只是哀家喝着，这粥里有股淡淡的姜味，吃下去倒是暖胃，稍稍舒服些。”\n  \n        琅意料之外，实在不知，忙看了身后伺候的御膳房太监一眼，便问：“是什么缘故？”\n  \n        太监打了个千儿，躬身答道：“娘娘的嘱咐是用御田新进的米做粥，但皇上从前儿夜里便有些胃寒。青樱小主知道了，特意吩咐奴才们加了少许嫩姜在粥里，可以温胃暖气。皇上用了一直觉得不错，所以今儿给太后进的粥也是如法炮制。”\n  \n        太后轻叹一声，见青樱还是跪着，便道：“我的儿！这才是用心用足了。”她看了青樱一眼，吩咐道，“在外头跪着，在哀家这里也跪着，也不怕伤了膝盖皇帝心疼，起来吧。”\n  \n        青樱这才敢谢恩起身。太后扶了扶鬓边的银累丝珍珠凤钗，道：“哀家还想喝点汤，你选一碗给哀家吧。”\n  \n        青樱不敢再轻举妄动，仔细斟酌了，才选了一碗“紫参雪鸡汤”舀了给太后。太后才看了一眼，眼圈便有些红了：“怎么选了这个汤？”\n  \n        青樱谨慎道：“紫参提气，雪鸡补身，适宜太后凤体。而且先帝在时，臣妾侍奉先帝与太后用膳，便听先帝嘱咐过此汤适宜太后饮用。如今请太后再饮，只当是请太后顾念先帝苦心，善自保养。”\n  \n        太后凝神片刻，拈过绢子拭泪道：“先帝在时，是最喜欢这道汤的，总说能提神补气，也常嘱咐哀家喝。如今看着，只是触景伤情罢了。何况先帝才走，这满桌的膳食，多半是荤腥，哀家哪里能入口？罢了吧。”\n  \n        这几句话虽不是拒绝用膳，但比方才更严重，青樱只觉得耳后根一阵比一阵烫，烧得头皮发痛，且御膳的汤饮，为怕凉了，都是拿紫铜吊子暖在那儿的。青樱捧着一碗滚烫的汤在手\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finished:

We provide a detailed description of our approach to ﬁne-tuning and safety\nimprovements of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 in order to enable the community to build on our work and\ncontribute to the responsible development of LLMs.\n⇤Equal contribution, corresponding authors: {tscialom, htouvron}@meta.com\n†Second author\nContributions for all the authors can be found in Section A.1.Contents\n1 Introduction 3\n2 Pretraining 5\n2.1 Pretraining Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.2 Training Details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.3 L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Pretrained Model Evaluation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3 Fine-tuning 8\n3.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n3.4 RLHF Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4 Safety 20\n4.1 Safety in Pretraining . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n4.3 Red Teaming . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse: The code executed successfully and extracted the text from the PDF file.

Guided by the scaling laws, we introduce DeepSeek LLM,\na project dedicated to advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective.\nTo support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2\ntrillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT)\nand direct preference optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the\ncreation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM\n67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B across a range of benchmarks, especially in the domains of code,\nmathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that our DeepSeek\nLLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5.\n*Authors are ordered alphabetically by the last name.\narXiv:2401.02954v1  [cs.CL]  5 Jan 2024\nContents\n1\nIntroduction\n3\n2\nPre-Training\n4\n2.1\nData . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4\n2.2\nArchitecture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5\n2.3\nHyperparameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5\n2.4\nInfrastructures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n6\n3\nScaling Laws\n7\n3.1\nScaling Laws for Hyperparameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n8\n3.2\nEstimating Optimal Model and Data Scaling\n. . . . . . . . . . . . \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse: The extracted text from the PDF file contains information about the DeepSeek LLM project, including its development and evaluation results.
