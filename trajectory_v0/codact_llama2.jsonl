The moving average helps to smooth out the short-term fluctuations in the data and reveal the longer-term trend. We can calculate the moving average using different time periods such as 50-day, 200-day, or 500-day moving average.\n\nAnother approach is to draw trend lines on the stock price data. A trend line is a graph that connects two or more data points to show the general direction of the data. By analyzing the slope of the trend line, we can determine whether the stock price is trending upward or downward.\n\nSeasonality analysis can also be used to identify the patterns in the stock price data. Seasonality refers to the tendency of the stock price to follow a repeating cycle of highs and lows throughout the year. By analyzing the seasonality of the stock price, we can identify the best time of the year to buy or sell the stock.\n\nTo analyze the trend of the stock price, we can use various statistical tools and techniques such as moving averages, trend lines, and seasonality analysis.
