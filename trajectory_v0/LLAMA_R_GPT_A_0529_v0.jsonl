However, it's crucial to look at longer-term trends to make a decision.\n\nThe moving averages provide a clearer picture of these trends. If the most recent prices are above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, this typically indicates a bullish trend suggesting that holding onto your shares might be beneficial as prices may continue to rise. Conversely, if prices are below these averages, it could indicate a bearish trend suggesting potential declines ahead.\n\nWithout seeing the very latest part of the chart due to format limitations here, I recommend reviewing whether Google's current price is above or below these key moving averages before making your final decision.
