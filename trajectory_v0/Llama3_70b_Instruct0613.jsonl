See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html You can find a list of all estimators that handle NaN values at the following page: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse: The error occurs because the K-Means algorithm does not accept missing values encoded as NaN.

However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath , which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM3and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM .\n1 Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signiﬁcant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1–4], coding [ 5–13] and math [ 14–19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further ﬁne-\ntuning with speciﬁc instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta’s series of Llama [ 4,20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [ 21], StarCoder [ 12], Alpaca [ 22],\nVicuna [ 23], and WizardLM [ 24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25–35].\n⇤Equal contribution. Work done during the internship of Luo at Microsoft Research.\n†Corresponding author: caxu@microsoft.com and shifeng.chen@siat.ac.cn\n3We are working with our legal team to review and publicly release the code and data in accordance with\nour policy.\nPreprint.

Self-Consistency [ 34] also achieves remarkable perfor-\nmance on many reasoning benchmarks, which generates several possible answers from the model\nand selects the correct one based on majority vote [ 35]. In recent, [ 36] ﬁnds that process supervision\nwith reinforcement learning signiﬁcantly outperforms outcome supervision for solving challenging\nMATH problems.\nInspired by Evol-Instruct and Process-supervised Reinforcement Learning, this work aims to enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of the SOTA open-source LLM, Llama-2 [ 20]. As shown in the\nFigure 1, we propose a new method named Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which could ﬁrstly generate\ndiverse math instructions data by math-speciﬁc Evol-Instruct , then we train an instruction reward\nmodel (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM) [ 16,36–41], the former indicates the\nquality of the evolved instruction and the later receives feedback for each step in the solution. The\nbrand-new Evol-Instruct method includes two downward evolution and upward evolution progress to\nproduce the grade school math and challenging math respectively. Initially, we re-generate, ﬁlter and\nﬁnetune the original math instruction data from GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43]. Immediately, we train\nthe Llama-2 models to obtain the reward models and our WizardMath .\nWe perform experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k [ 42] and\nMATH [ 43], the results demonstrate that our WizardMath outperforms all other open-source LLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. Speciﬁcally, WizardMath observe a substantial improvement\nin pass@1 with an increase of +24.8 (81.6. vs. 56.8) on GSM8k, and +9.2 (22.7 vs. 13.5) on MATH.\nNotably, our model even also signiﬁcantly surpasses OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.55, Anthropic’s Claude\nInstant-1 [39], and Google’s PaLM-2 [44] in terms of pass@1 on GSM8k.\nThe main contributions of this work are as following:\n•We introduce WizardMath model, which enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities for\nopen-source pretrained large language model Llama-2 [20].\n2•We propose a new method, Reinforced Evol-Instruct , alongside Evol-Instruct and Reinforce-\nment Learning, for improving LLM reasoning performance.\n•WizardMath surpasses all other open-source LLMs by a substantial margin in terms of math-\nematical reasoning, including Llama-2 70B [ 20], Llama-1 65B [ 4], Falcon-40B [ 21], MPT-\n30B8, Baichuan-13B Chat9and ChatGLM2 12B [ 45] on both GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43].\n•WizardMath signiﬁcantly outperforms various main closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT5,\nGPT-3.5, Claude Instant [39], PaLM-2 [44], PaLM-1 [7] and Minerva[15] on GSM8k.\n2 Method\nIn this section, we elaborate on the details of our WizardMath . Following WizardLM and PRMs[ 36],\nwe propose Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which integrates the Evol-Instruct and reinforced process\nsupervision method to evolve GSM8k and MATH, and ﬁne-tune the pre-trained Llama-2 with the\nevolved data and reward models.\nAs shown in the Figure 1, our methods apply three steps:\n1.Supervised ﬁne-tuning.\n2.Training instruction reward model, and process-supervised reward model.\n3.Active Evol-Instruct, and PPO training.\n2.1 Supervised ﬁne-tuning\nFollowing InstructGPT[ 2], we also ﬁrstly ﬁne tune the base with supervised instruction-response\npairs, which contains:\n1.To make the parsing of each step easier, we few-shot re-generate 15k answers for GSM8k\nand MATH with an Alpha version of WizardLM 70B model to produce solutions in a\nstep-by-step format, then ﬁnd out those with a correct answer, and use this data to ﬁnetune\nbase Llama model.\n2.To enhance the model’s ability to adhere to the neural and diverse instructions, we also\nsample 1.5k open-domain conversations from WizardLM’s training data, then merge it with\nabove math corpus as the ﬁnal SFT training data.\n2.2 Evol-Instruct principles for math\nMotivated by the Evol-Instruct [ 24] method proposed by WiazrdLM and its effective application\non WizardCoder [ 13], this work attempts to make math instructions with various complexities and\ndiversity to enhance the pre-trained LLMs. Speciﬁcally, we adapt Evol-Instruct to a new paradigm\nincluding two evolution lines:\n1.Downward evolution: It enhances instructions by making the questions easier. For example\ni): revising high difﬁculty questions to lower difﬁculty, or ii) producing a new and easier\nquestion with another different topic.\n2.Upward evolution: Derived from original Evol-Instruct method, it deepens and generates\nnew and harder questions by i) adding more constraints, ii) concretizing, iii) increasing\nreasoning.\n2.3 Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nInspired by InstructGPT[ 2] and PRMs[ 36], we train two reward models to predict the quality of the\ninstructions and the correctness of each step in the answer respectively:\n1.Instruction Reward Model (IRM): This model aims to judge the quality of the evolved\ninstructions on three aspects: i) Deﬁnition, ii) Precision, and iii) Integrity. To produce\nthe ranking list training data of IRM, for each instruction, we ﬁrstly use ChatGPT and\n3\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse: The task is to summarize the paper \"WizardMath\" and identify its main contributions.\n\nThis Step Todo: Analyze the paper and extract the main ideas and contributions.\n\nCode: Not needed for this step.\n\nThe paper \"WizardMath\" presents a new method called Reinforced Evol-Instruct to enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).

 \n    』\n\n------章节内容开始-------\n后宫·如懿传1 第一章 灵前\n\n  \n        云板声连叩不断，哀声四起，仿若云雷闷闷盘旋在头顶，叫人窒闷而敬畏。国有大丧，天下知。\n  \n        青樱俯身于众人之间，叩首，起身，俯身，叩首，眼中的泪麻木地流着，仿若永不干涸的泉水，却没有一滴，是真真正正发自内心的悲恸。\n  \n        对于金棺中这个人，他是生是死，实在引不起青樱过多的悲喜。他，不过是自己夫君的父亲，王朝的先帝，甚至，遗弃了自己表姑母的男人。\n  \n        想到这里，青樱不觉打了个寒噤，又隐隐有些欢喜。一朝王府成潜龙府邸，自己的夫君君临天下，皆是拜这个男人之死所赐。这样的念头一转，青樱悄然抬眸望向别的妻妾格格——不，如今都是妃嫔了，只是名分未定而已。\n  \n        青樱一凛，复又低眉顺眼按着位序跪在福晋身后，身后是与她平起平坐的高晞月，一样的浑身缟素，一样的梨花带雨，不胜哀戚。\n  \n        忽然，前头微微有些骚动起来，有侍女低声惊呼起来：“主子娘娘晕过去了！”\n  \n        青樱跪在前头，立时膝行上前，跟着扶住晕过去的富察氏。高晞月也跟着上来，惶急道：“主子娘娘跪了一夜，怕是累着了。快去通报皇上和太后。”\n  \n        这个时候，太后和皇上都已疲乏，早在别宫安置了。青樱看了晞月一眼，朗声向众人道：“主子娘娘伤心过度，快扶去偏殿休息。素心，你是伺候主子娘娘的人，你去通报一声，说这边有咱们伺候就是了，不必请皇上和太后两宫再漏夜赶来。”\n  \n        晞月横了青樱一眼，不欲多言。青樱亦懒得和她争辩，先扶住了富察氏，等着眼明手快的小太监抬了软轿来，一齐拥着富察氏进了偏殿。\n  \n        晞月意欲跟进伺候，青樱身姿一晃，侧身拦住，轻声道：“这里不能没有人主持，太后和太妃们都去歇息了，主子娘娘和我进去，姐姐就是位分最高的侧福晋。”\n  \n        晞月眼眸如波，朝着青樱浅浅一漾，温柔的眼眸中闪过一丝不驯，她柔声细语：“妹妹与我都是侧福晋，我怎敢不随侍在主子娘娘身边？”她顿一顿，“而且，主子娘娘醒来，未必喜欢看见妹妹。”\n  \n        青樱笑而不语，望着她淡然道：“姐姐自然是明白的。”\n  \n        晞月微微咬一咬唇：“我希望自己永远都能明白。”\n  \n        她退后两步，复又跪下，朝着先帝的金棺哀哀痛哭，仿似清雨梨花，低下柔枝，无限凄婉。\n  \n        青樱在转入帘幕之前望了她一眼，亦不觉叹然，怎么会有这样的女人？轻柔得如同一团薄雾轻云，连伤心亦是，美到让人不忍移目。\n  \n        青樱转到偏殿中，素心和莲心已经将富察氏扶到榻上躺着，一边一个替富察氏擦着脸扑着扇子。青樱连忙吩咐了随侍的太监，叮嘱道：“立刻打了热水来，虽在九月里，别让主子娘娘擦脸着了凉。莲心，你伺候主子娘娘用些温水，仔细别烫着了。”说罢又吩咐自己的侍女，“惢心，你去开了窗透气，那么多人闷着，只怕娘娘更难受。太医已经去请了吧？”\n  \n        惢心连忙答应：“是。已经打发人悄悄去请了。”\n  \n        素心闻言，不觉双眉微挑，问道：“主子娘娘身子不适，怎么请个太医还要鬼鬼祟祟的？”\n  \n        青樱含笑转脸：“姑娘不知道，不是鬼鬼祟祟的。而是方才高姐姐的话说坏了。”\n  \n        素心颇为不解，更是疑心：“说坏了？”\n  \n        青樱不欲与她多言，便走前几步看着太监们端了热水进来，惢心侧身在素心身边，温和而不失分寸：“方才月福晋说，主子娘娘是累着了才晕倒的……”\n  \n        素心还欲再问，富察氏已经悠悠醒转，轻嗽着道：“糊涂！”\n  \n        莲心一脸欢欣，替富察氏抚着心口道：“主子娘娘要不要再喝些水？哭了一夜也该润润喉咙了。”\n  \n        富察氏慢慢喝了一口水，便是不适也不愿乱了鬓发，顺手一抚，才慢慢坐直身子，叱道：“糊涂！还不请侧福晋坐下。”\n  \n        青樱闻得富察氏醒转，早已垂首侍立一边，恭声道：“主子娘娘醒了。”\n  \n        富察氏笑笑：“主子娘娘？这个称呼只有皇后才受得起，皇上还未行册封礼，这个称呼是不是太早了？”\n  \n        青樱不卑不亢：“主子娘娘明鉴。皇上已在先帝灵前登基，虽未正式册封皇后，可主子娘娘是皇上结发，自然是名正言顺的皇后。如今再称福晋不妥，直呼皇后却也没有旨意，只好折中先唤了主子娘娘。”青樱见富察氏只是不做声，便行了大礼，“主子娘娘万福金安。”\n  \n        富察氏也不叫起来，只是悠悠叹息了一声：“这样说来，我还叫你侧福晋，却是委屈你了。”\n  \n        青樱低着头：“侧福晋与格格受封妃嫔，皆由主子娘娘统领六宫裁决封赏。妾身此时的确还是侧福晋，主子娘娘并未委屈妾身。”\n  \n        富察氏笑了一笑，细细打量着青樱：“青樱，你就这般滴水不漏，一丝错缝儿也没有么？”\n  \n        青樱越发低头，柔婉道：“妾身没有过错得以保全，全托赖主子娘娘教导顾全。”\n  \n        富察氏凝神片刻，温和道：“起来吧。”又问，“素心，是月福晋在外头看着吧？”\n  \n        素心忙道：“是。”\n  \n        富察氏扫了殿中一眼，叹了口气：“是青福晋安排的吧？果然事事妥帖。”她见素心有些不服，看向青樱道，“你做得甚好，月福晋说我累了……唉，我当为后宫命妇表率，怎可在众人面前累晕了？只怕那些爱兴风作浪的小人，要在后头嚼舌根说我托懒不敬先帝呢。来日太后和皇上面前，我怎么担待得起？”\n  \n        青樱颔首：“妾身明白，主子娘娘是为先帝爷驾崩伤心过度才晕倒的。高姐姐也只是关心情切，才会失言。”\n  \n        富察氏微微松了口气：“总算你还明白事理。”她目光在青樱身上悠悠一荡，“只是，你处事一定要如此滴水不漏么？”\n  \n        青樱低声：“妾身伺候主子，不敢不尽心。”\n  \n        富察氏似赞非赞：“到底是乌拉那拉氏的后人，细密周到。”\n  \n        青樱隐隐猜到富察氏所指，只觉后背一凉，越发不敢多言。\n  \n        富察氏望着她，一言不发。青樱只觉得气闷难过，这样沉默相对，比在潜邸时妻妾间偶尔或明或暗的争斗更难过。\n  \n        空气如胶凝一般，莲心适时端上一碗参汤：“主子喝点参汤提提神，太医就快来了。”\n  \n        富察氏接过参汤，拿银匙慢慢搅着，神色稳如泰山：“如今进了宫，好歹也是一家人，你就不去看看景仁宫那位吗？”\n  \n        青樱道：“先帝驾崩，太后未有懿旨放景仁宫娘娘出宫行丧礼，妾身自然不得相见。”\n  \n        富察氏微微一笑，搁下参汤：“有缘，自然会相见的。”\n  \n        青樱越发不能接口。富察氏何曾见过她如此样子，心中微微得意，脸上气色也好看了些。\n  \n        二人正沉默着，外头击掌声连绵响起，正是皇帝进来前侍从通报的暗号，提醒着宫人们尽早预备着。\n  \n        果然皇帝先进来了。富察氏气息一弱，低低唤道：“皇上……”\n  \n        青樱行礼：“皇上万福金安。”\n  \n        皇帝也不看她，只抬了抬手，随口道：“起来吧。”\n  \n        青樱起身退到门外，扬一扬脸，殿中的宫女太监也跟了出来。\n  \n        皇帝快步走到榻边，按住富察氏的手：“琅，叫你受累了。”\n  \n        富察氏眼中泪光一闪，柔情愈浓：“是臣妾无能，叫皇上担心了。”\n  \n        皇帝温声道：“你生了永琏与和敬之后身子一直弱，如今既要主持丧仪，又要看顾后宫诸事，是让你劳累了。”\n  \n        富察氏有些虚弱，低低道：“晞月和青樱两位妹妹，很能帮着臣妾。”\n  \n        皇帝拍拍她的手背：“那就好。”皇帝指一指身后，“朕听说你不适，就忍不住来了，正好也催促太医过来，给你仔细瞧瞧。”\n  \n        富察氏道：“多谢皇上关爱。”\n  \n        青樱在外头侍立，一时也不敢走远，只想着皇帝的样子，方才惊鸿一瞥，此刻倒是清清楚楚印在了脑子里。\n  \n        因着居丧，皇帝并未剃发去须，两眼也带着血丝，想是没睡好。想到此节，青樱不觉心疼，悄声向惢心道：“皇上累着了，怕是虚火旺，你去炖些银耳莲子羹，每日送去皇上宫里。记着，要悄悄儿的。”\n  \n        惢心答应着退下。恰巧皇帝带了人出来，青樱复又行礼：“恭送皇上，皇上万安。”\n  \n        皇帝瞥了随侍一眼，那些人何等聪明，立刻站在原地不动，如泥胎木偶一般。皇帝上前两步，青樱默然跟上。皇帝方悄然道：“朕是不是难看了？”\n  \n        青樱想笑，却不敢做声，只得咬唇死死忍住。二人对视一眼，青樱道：“皇上保重。”\n  \n        皇帝正好也说：“青樱，你保重。”\n  \n        青樱心中一动，不觉痴痴望着皇帝。皇帝回头看一眼，亦是柔情：“朕还要去前头，你别累着自己。”\n  \n        青樱道了声“是”。见皇帝走远了，御驾的随侍也紧紧跟上，只觉心头骤暖，慢慢微笑出来。\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n第二章 自处\n\n  \n        外头的月光乌蒙蒙的，暗淡得不见任何光华，青樱低低说：“怕是要下雨了呢。”\n  \n        惢心关切道：“小主站在廊檐下吧，万一掉下雨珠子来，怕凉着了您。”\n  \n        正巧素心引着太医出来，太医见了青樱，打了个千儿道：“给小主请安。”\n  \n        青樱点点头：“起来吧。主子娘娘凤体无恙吧？”\n  \n        太医忙道：“主子娘娘万安，只是操持丧仪连日辛劳，又兼伤心过度，才会如此。只须养几日，就能好了。”\n  \n        青樱客气道：“有劳太医了。”\n  \n        素心道：“太医快请吧，娘娘还等着你的方子和药呢。”\n  \n        太医诺诺答应了，素心转过脸来，朝着青樱一笑，话也客气了许多：“回小主的话，主子娘娘要在里头歇息了，怕今夜不能再去大殿主持丧仪。主子娘娘说了，一切有劳小主了。”\n  \n        青樱听她这样说，知是富察氏知晓晞月不堪重用，只管托赖了自己应对，忙道：“请主子娘娘安心养息。”\n  \n        青樱回到殿中，满殿缟素之下的哭泣声已经微弱了许多，大约跪哭了一日，凭谁也都累了。青樱吩咐殿外的宫女：“几位年长的宗亲福晋怕挨不得熬夜之苦，你们去御膳房将炖好的参汤拿来请福晋们饮些，若还有支持不住的，就请到偏殿歇息，等子时大哭时再请过来。”\n  \n        宫女们都答应着下去了，晞月在内殿瞧见，脸上便有些不悦。青樱进来，便道：“方才要妹妹替主子娘娘主持一切，实在是辛苦妹妹了。”\n  \n        晞月也不做声，只淡淡道：“你一句一句妹妹叫得好生顺口，其实论年岁算，我还虚长了你七岁呢。”\n  \n        青樱知她所指，只是在潜邸之中，她原是位序第一的侧福晋，名分分明，原不在年纪上。当下也不理会，只微微笑道：“是么？”\n  \n        晞月见她不以为意，不觉隐隐含怒，别过脸去不肯再和她说话。\n  \n        过了一个时辰，便是大哭的时候了。合宫寂静，人人忍着困意提起了精神，生怕哀哭不力，便落了个“不敬先帝”的罪名。执礼太监高声喊道：“举哀——”众人等着嫔妃们领头跪下，便可放声大哭了。\n  \n        因着富察氏不在，青樱哀哀哭了起来，正预备第一个跪下去。谁知站在她身侧一步的晞月抢先跪了下去，哀哀恸哭起来。\n  \n        晞月原本声音柔美，一哭起来愈加清婉悠亮，颇有一唱三叹之效，十分哀戚。连远远站在外头伺候的杂役小太监们，亦不觉心酸起来。\n  \n        按着在潜邸的位分次序，便该是晞月在青樱之后，谁知晞月横刺里闯到了青樱前头放声举哀，事出突然，众人一时都愣在了那里。\n  \n        潜邸的格格苏绿筠更是张口结舌，忍不住轻声道：“月福晋，这……青福晋的位次，是在您之上啊。”\n  \n        晞月根本不理会苏氏的话，只纹丝不动，跪着哭泣。\n  \n        青樱当众受辱，心中暗自生怒，只硬生生忍着不做声。惢心已经变了脸色，正要上前说话，青樱暗暗拦住，看了跟在身后的格格苏绿筠一眼，慢慢跪了下去。\n  \n        绿筠会意，即刻随着青樱跪下，身后的格格们一个跟着一个，然后是亲贵福晋、诰命夫人、宫女太监，随着晞月举起右手侧耳伏身行礼，齐声哭了起来。\n  \n        哀痛声声里，青樱盯着晞月举起的纤柔手腕，半露在重重缟素衣袖间的一串翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯在烛火中透着莹然如春水的光泽，刺得她双目发痛。青樱随着礼仪俯下身体，看着自己手腕上一模一样的镯子，死死地咬住了嘴唇。\n  \n        待到礼毕，已子时过半，晞月先起身环视众人，道了声：“今日暂去歇息，明日行礼，请各位按时到来。”如此，众人依序退去，青樱扶着酸痛的双膝起身，扶了惢心的手，一言不发就往外走。\n  \n        格格苏绿筠一向胆小怕事，默然撇开侍女的手，紧紧跟了过来。\n  \n        青樱心中有气，出了殿门连软轿都不坐，脚下越走越快，直走到了长街深处。终于，惢心亦忍不住，唤道：“小主，小主歇歇脚吧。”\n  \n        青樱缓缓驻足，换了口气，才隐隐觉得脚下酸痛。一回头却见绿筠鬓发微蓬，娇喘吁吁，才知自己情急之下走得太快，连绿筠跟在身后也没发觉。\n  \n        青樱不觉苦笑，柔声道：“你生下三阿哥才三个多月，这样跟着我疾走，岂不伤了身子？”青樱见她身姿孱孱，愈加不忍，“是我不好，没察觉你跟着我来了。”\n  \n        绿筠怯怯：“侧福晋言重了，我的身子不相干。倒是今日……高姐姐如此失礼，可怎生是好？”\n  \n        青樱正要说话，却见潜邸格格金玉妍坐在软轿上翩跹而来。\n  \n        金玉妍下了软轿，扶着侍女的手走近，笑吟吟道：“怎生是好？这样的大事，总有皇上和主子娘娘知道的时候，何况还有太后呢。侧福晋今日受的委屈，还怕没得报仇么？”\n  \n        青樱和缓道：“自家姐妹，有什么报仇不报仇的，玉妍妹妹言重了。”\n  \n        金玉妍福了一福，又与苏绿筠见了平礼，方腻声道：“妹妹也觉得奇怪，高姐姐一向温柔可人，哪怕从前在潜邸中也和侧福晋置气，却也不至如此。难道一进宫中，人人的脾气都见长了么？”\n  \n        绿筠忙道：“何人脾气见长了？玉妍妹妹得皇上宠爱，可以随口说笑，咱们却不敢。”\n  \n        玉妍媚眼如丝，轻俏道：“姐姐说到宠爱二字，妹妹就自愧不如了。现放着侧福晋呢，皇上对侧福晋才是万千宠爱。”她故作沉吟，“哎呀！难道高姐姐是想着，进了紫禁城，侧福晋会与景仁宫那位一家团聚，会失幸于皇上和太后，才会如此不敬？”\n  \n        青樱略略正色：“先帝驾崩，正是国孝家孝于一身的时候，这会子说什么宠爱不宠爱的，是不是错了时候？”\n  \n        绿筠忙收了神色，恭身站在一旁。玉妍托着腮，笑盈盈道：“侧福晋好气势，只是这样的气势，若是方才能对着高姐姐发一发，也算让高姐姐知道厉害了呢。”玉妍屈膝道，“夜深人困倦，才进宫就有这样的好戏，日后还怕会少么？妹妹先告辞，养足了精神等着看呢。”\n  \n        玉妍扬长而去，绿筠看她如此，不觉皱了皱眉。\n  \n        青樱劝道：“罢了。你不是不知道金玉妍的性子，虽说是和你一样的格格位分，在潜邸的资历也不如你，但她是朝鲜宗室的女儿，先帝特赐了皇上的，咱们待她总要客气些，无须和她生气。”\n  \n        绿筠愁眉不展：“姐姐说得是，我何尝不知道呢？如今皇上为了她的身份好听些，特特又指了上驷院的三保大人做她义父，难怪她更了不得了。”\n  \n        青樱安慰道：“我知道你与她住一块儿，难免有些不顺心。等皇上册封了六宫，迟早会给你们安置更好的宫殿。你放心，你才生了三阿哥，她总越不过你去的。”\n  \n        绿筠忧心忡忡地看着青樱：“月福晋在皇上面前最温柔、善解人意，如今一进宫，连她也变了性子，还有什么是不能的？”绿筠望着长街甬道，红墙高耸，直欲压人而下，不觉瑟缩了细柔的肩，“常道紫禁城怨魂幽心，日夜作祟，难道变人心性，就这般厉害么？”\n  \n        这样乌深的夜，月光隐没，连星子也不见半点。只见殿脊重重叠叠如远山重峦，有倾倒之势，更兼宫中处处点着大丧的白纸灯笼，如鬼火点点，来往皆白衣素裳，当真凄凄如鬼魅之地。\n  \n        青樱握了握绿筠的手，温和道：“子不语怪力乱神。绿筠你好歹还痴长我几岁，怎么倒来吓我呢？何况高晞月的温柔，那是对着皇上，可从不是对着我们。”\n  \n        绿筠闻言，亦不觉含笑。\n  \n        青樱望着这陌生的紫禁城，淡然道：“你我虽都是紫禁城的儿媳，常常入宫请安，可真正住在这里，却也还是头一回。至于这里是否有怨魂幽心，我想，变人心性，总是人比鬼更厉害些吧。”\n  \n        毕竟劳碌终日，二人言罢也就散去了。\n  \n        晞月回到宫中，已觉得困倦难当。晞月在和合福仙梨木桌边坐下，立时有宫女端了红枣燕窝上来，恭声道：“小主累了，用点燕窝吧。”\n  \n        晞月扬了扬脸示意宫女放下，随手拔下头上几支银簪子递到心腹侍婢茉心手中，口中道：“什么劳什子！暗沉沉的，又重，压得我脑仁疼。”说罢摸着自己腕上碧莹莹的翡翠珠缠丝赤金莲花镯，“还好这镯子是主子娘娘赏的，哪怕守丧也不必摘下。否则整天看着这些黯沉颜色，人也没了生气。”\n  \n        茉心接过簪子放在妆台上，又替晞月将鬓边的白色绢花和珍珠压鬓摘下，笑道：“小主天生丽质，哪怕是簪了乌木簪子，也是艳冠群芳。何况这镯子虽然一样都有，小主戴着就是比青福晋好看。”\n  \n        晞月瞥她一眼，笑吟吟道：“就会说嘴。艳冠群芳？现放着金玉妍呢，皇上可不是宠爱她芳姿独特？”\n  \n        茉心笑：“再芳姿独特也不过是个小国贱女，算什么呢？主子娘娘体弱，苏绿筠性子怯懦，剩下的几个格格侍妾都入不得眼，唯一能与小主平起平坐的，不过一个乌拉那拉青樱。只是如今小主已经作了筏子给她瞧了，看她还能得意多久！”\n  \n        晞月慢慢舀了两口燕窝，轻浅笑道：“从前她总仗着是先帝孝敬皇后和景仁宫皇后的表侄女儿，又是先帝和太后指婚给皇上的，得意过了头。如今太后得势，先帝与孝敬皇后都已作古，景仁宫那位反倒成了她的累赘了。想来太后和皇上也不会再敷衍她。”\n  \n        茉心替晞月捶着肩道：“可不是么，奴婢瞧主子娘娘也不愿看她。”\n  \n        晞月叹口气：“从前虽然都是侧福晋，我又比她年长，可是我进府时才是格格，虽然后来封了侧福晋，可旁人眼里到底觉着我不如她，明里暗里叫我受了多少气？同样这个镯子，原是一对的，偏要我和她一人一个，形单影只的，也不如一对在一起好看。”\n  \n        茉心想着自己小主的前程，也颇痛快：“可不是。小主手腕纤细白皙，最适合戴翡翠了。也是她从前得意罢了，如今给了她个下马威，也算让她知道了。侧福晋有什么要紧，要紧的是在后宫的位分、皇上的宠爱。”\n  \n        晞月柔婉一笑，嘉许地看了茉心一眼，又不免有些忧心：“我今日在哭灵时这样做，实在冒险。你的消息可确实么？”\n  \n        茉心笑道：“小主放一百二十个心，是主子娘娘身边的莲心亲口来告诉奴婢的，说是听见皇上与主子娘娘说的。给莲心一万个胆子，她也不敢撒这样的弥天大谎啊！”\n  \n        晞月闭上秀美狭长的凤眼，笑道：“那就好了。”\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n第三章 风雨\n\n  \n        夜深。\n  \n        殿中富察氏正喝药，莲心伺候在旁，接过富察氏喝完的药碗，又递过清水伺候她漱口。方漱了口，素心便奉上蜜饯，道：“这是新腌制的甜酸杏子，主子尝一个，去去嘴里的苦味儿。”\n  \n        富察氏吃了一颗，正要合着被子躺下，忽地仿佛听到什么，惊起身来，侧耳凝神道：“是不是永琏在哭？是不是？”\n  \n        素心忙道：“主子万安，二阿哥在阿哥所呢，这个时候正睡得香。”\n  \n        富察氏似有不信，担心道：“真的？永琏认床，怕生，他夜里又爱哭。”素心道：“就为二阿哥认床，主子不是嘱咐乳母把潜邸时二阿哥睡惯的床挪到了阿哥所么？宫里又足足添了十六个乳母嬷嬷照应，断不会有差池的。”\n  \n        富察氏松了口气：“那就好。只是那些乳母嬷嬷，都是靠得住的吧？还有，大阿哥也住在阿哥所……”\n  \n        素心微笑：“主子娘娘的安排，哪次不是妥妥帖帖的？大阿哥虽然也住在阿哥所，但和咱们二阿哥怎么能比？”\n  \n        富察氏点点头：“大阿哥的生母虽然和我同宗，却这样没福，偏在皇上登基前就过世了，丢下大阿哥孤零零一个。”她婉转看了素心一眼，“你吩咐阿哥所，对大阿哥也要用心看顾，别欺负了这没娘的孩子。”\n  \n        素心含笑：“奴婢明白，知道怎么做。”\n  \n        富察氏似乎还不安心，有些辗转反侧。莲心放下水墨青花帐帷，苦口婆心劝道：“主子安置吧，睡不了几个时辰又得起来主持丧仪。今夜您不在，大殿里可不知闹成什么样子了呢。”\n  \n        富察氏微微一笑，有些疲倦地伏在枕上，一把瀑布似的青丝蜿蜒下柔婉的弧度，如她此刻的语气一般：“是啊。可不知要闹成什么样子呢？尚未册封嫔妃，她们就都按捺不住性子了么？”\n  \n        莲心淡然道：“由得她们闹去，只要主子娘娘是皇后，凭谁都闹不起来。”\n  \n        富察氏淡淡一笑：“闹不起来？在潜邸时就一个个乌眼鸡似的，如今只怕闹得更厉害吧。”她翻了个身，朝里头睡了，“只是她们耐不住性子爱闹，就由着她们闹去吧。”\n  \n        富察氏不再说话，莲心放下帐帘，素心吹熄了灯，只留了一盏亮着，两人悄然退了出去。\n  \n        青樱回到宫中，只仿若无事人一般。陪嫁侍婢阿箬满脸含笑迎了上来：“小主辛苦了。奴婢已经准备好热水，伺候小主洗漱。”\n  \n        青樱点点头不说话，抬眼见阿箬样样准备精当，一应服侍的宫女捧着金盆栉巾肃立一旁，静默无声，不觉讶异道：“何必这样大费周章？按着潜邸的规矩简单洗漱便是了。”\n  \n        阿箬笑盈盈靠近青樱，极力压抑着喜悦之情，一脸隐秘：“自小主入了潜邸，皇上最宠爱的就是您，哪怕是福晋主子也比不上。高小主虽然也是侧福晋，但她起先不过是个格格，后来才被封的侧福晋，如何比得上您尊贵荣耀？”\n  \n        惢心淡淡看她一眼：“好端端的，你和小主说起这个做什么？”\n  \n        阿箬笑意愈浓，颇为自得：“大阿哥是富察诸瑛格格生的，诸瑛格格早就弃世而去，那就不提。福晋主子生了二阿哥，将来自然是皇后，但得不得宠却难说。苏小主有了三阿哥，却和高小主一样，是汉军旗出身，那可不行了。”\n  \n        青樱慢慢拨着鬓角一朵雪白的珠花。银质的护甲触动珠花轻滑有声，指尖却慢慢沁出汗来，连摸着光润的珍珠都觉得艰涩。青樱不动声色：“那又怎样呢？”\n  \n        阿箬只顾欢喜，根本未察觉青樱的神色：“所以呀，小主一定\n"}], "index": "77", "category1": "文档处理\n（pandoc）", "category2": "总结摘要", "category3": "提取文本+总结摘要/分析", "user": "读一下这篇小说的前1万字，告诉我这篇小说讲了什么", "file_paths": ["./data/如懿传.txt"],

Human raters compared model generations on ~4k\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts.\nThe 95% conﬁdence intervals for this evaluation are between\n1% and 2%. More details in Section 3.4.2. While reviewing\nthese results, it is important to note that human evaluations\ncan be noisy due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity\nof the review guidelines, subjectivity of individual raters,\nand the inherent di\u0000culty of comparing generations.\nFigure 2: Win-rate % for helpfulness and\nsafety between commercial-licensed base-\nlines and L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , according to GPT-\n4. To complement the human evaluation, we\nused a more capable model, not subject to\nour own guidance. Green area indicates our\nmodel is better according to GPT-4. To remove\nties, we used win/ (win +loss). The orders in\nwhich the model responses are presented to\nGPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\ncomplex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of ﬁelds, including in specialized\ndomains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n(Ho\u0000mann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily ﬁne-tuned to align with human\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require signiﬁcant costs in\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and ﬁne-tuned LLMs, L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 and\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-speciﬁc data\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our ﬁne-tuning methodology and approach to improving\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce ﬁne-tuned LLMs and\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 andL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , such as\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\n3Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 compared to other open-source and closed-\nsource models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is\nimportant to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the\nprompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these\nsafety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 models.\nWe are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\n1.L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 , an updated version of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 , trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 with\n7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper\nbut are not releasing.§\n2.L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , a ﬁne-tuned version of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net beneﬁt to society. Like all LLMs,\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , developers should perform\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their speciﬁc applications of the model. We provide a responsible use\nguide¶and code examples\u0000to facilitate the safe deployment of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 andL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 . More details of\nour responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3.\nThe remainder of this paper describes our pretraining methodology (Section 2), ﬁne-tuning methodology\n(Section 3), approach to model safety (Section 4), key observations and insights (Section 5), relevant related\nwork (Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).\n‡https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/\n§We are delaying the release of the 34B model due to a lack of time to su\u0000ciently red team.\n¶https://ai.meta.com/llama\n\u0000https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\n4\n\nIntroduction:\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse: The task is to summarize the paper \"LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models\" and identify the main contributions of this work.\n\nThis Step Todo: Summarize the paper and identify the main contributions.\n\nThe paper introduces LLaMA 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

By predicting the next word in continuous text, LLMs undergo\nself-supervised pre-training on massive datasets, enabling them to achieve various purposes and\npossess many abilities, such as novel creation, text summarization, code completion, and more.\nSubsequent developments like supervised ﬁne-tuning and reward modeling have enabled Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to better follow user intentions and instructions. This has endowed\nthem with more versatile conversational capabilities and rapidly expanded their inﬂuence.\nThis wave is sparked with closed products , such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), Claude (An-\nthropic, 2023), and Bard (Google, 2023), which are developed with extensive computational\nresources and substantial annotation costs. These products have signiﬁcantly raised the commu-\nnity’s expectations for the capabilities of open-source LLMs, consequently inspiring a series of\nwork (Bai et al., 2023; Du et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Yang et al., 2023).\nAmong these, the LLaMA series models (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) stand out. It consolidates a\nrange of works to create an efﬁcient and stable architecture, building well-performing models\nranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Consequently, the LLaMA series has become the de facto\nbenchmark for architecture and performance among open-source models.\nFollowing LLaMA, the open-source community has primarily focused on training ﬁxed-size\n(7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B), high-quality models, often neglecting research exploration into LLM\nscaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020). Nonetheless, research on scaling laws is\nof utmost importance, considering that the current open-source models are merely at the initial\nstage of Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) development. In addition, early works (Hoffmann\net al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) reached varying conclusions on the scaling of model and data\nwith increased compute budgets and inadequately addressed hyperparameter discussions. In\nthis paper, we extensively investigate the scaling behavior of language models and apply our\nﬁndings in two widely used large-scale model conﬁgurations, namely 7B and 67B. Our study\naims to lay the groundwork for future scaling of open-source LLMs, paving the way for further\nadvancements in this domain. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst examined the scaling laws of batch size\nand learning rate, and found their trends with model size. Building on this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive study of the scaling laws of the data and model scale, successfully revealing the\noptimal model/data scaling-up allocation strategy and predicting the expected performance\nof our large-scale models. Additionally, during development, we discovered that the scaling\nlaws derived from different datasets show signiﬁcant differences. This suggests that choice\nof dataset remarkably affects the scaling behavior, indicating that caution should be exercised\nwhen generalizing scaling laws across datasets.\nUnder the guidance of our scaling laws, we build from scratch open-source large language\nmodels, and release as much information as possible for community reference. We collect\n2 trillion tokens for pre-training, primarily in Chinese and English. At the model level, we\ngenerally followed the architecture of LLaMA, but replaced the cosine learning rate scheduler\nwith a multi-step learning rate scheduler, maintaining performance while facilitating continual\ntraining. We collected over 1 million instances for supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT) (Ouyang et al.,\n2022) from diverse sources. This paper shares our experiences with different SFT strategies\nand ﬁndings in data ablation techniques. Additionally, we have utilized direct preference\noptimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) to improve the conversational performance of the\nmodel.\n3We conduct extensive evaluations using our base and chat models. The evaluation results\ndemonstrate that DeepSeek LLM surpasses LLaMA-2 70B across various benchmarks, particu-\nlarly in the ﬁelds of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Following SFT and DPO, the DeepSeek\n67B chat model outperforms GPT-3.5 in both Chinese and English open-ended evaluations. This\nhighlights the superior performance of DeepSeek 67B in generating high-quality responses and\nengaging in meaningful conversations in both languages. Furthermore, the safety evaluation\nindicates that DeepSeek 67B Chat can provide harmless responses in practice.\nIn the rest of this paper, we ﬁrst introduce our pre-training basic concepts of DeepSeek\nLLM in Section 2, including the composition of data, model architecture, infrastructure, and\nhyperparameters. In Section 3, we provide a detailed explanation of the scaling laws we have\ndiscovered and its implications. Additionally, we discuss the rationale behind our selection of\npre-training hyperparameters, taking into account the insights gained from the scaling laws\nanalysis. In Section 4, we discuss our ﬁne-tuning methodology, encompassing the composition\nof ﬁne-tuning data and speciﬁc methods during the SFT and DPO stages. We then present\nthe detailed evaluation results of DeepSeek LLM in Section 5, covering both the base and chat\nmodels, as well as their performance in open-ended evaluations and safety evaluations. Finally,\nwe discuss the current limitations and future directions of DeepSeek LLM in Section 6.\n2.Pre-Training\n2.1.Data\nOur main objective is to comprehensively enhance the richness and diversity of the dataset.\nWe have gained valuable insights from reputable sources such as (Computer, 2023; Gao et al.,\n2020; Penedo et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a). To achieve these goals, we have organized our\napproach into three essential stages: deduplication, ﬁltering, and remixing. The deduplication\nand remixing stages ensure a diverse representation of the data by sampling unique instances.\nThe ﬁltering stage enhances the density of information, thereby enabling more efﬁcient and\neffective model training.\nWe adopted an aggressive deduplication strategy, expanding the deduplication scope. Our\nanalysis revealed that deduplicating the entire Common Crawl corpus results in higher removal\nof duplicate instances compared to deduplicating within a single dump. Table 1 illustrates\nthat deduplicating across 91 dumps eliminates four times more documents than a single dump\nmethod.\nDumps Used 1 2 6 12 16 22 41 91\nDeduplication Rate (%) 22.2 46.7 55.7 69.9 75.7 76.3 81.6 89.8\nTable 1 |Deduplication ratios for various Common Crawl dumps.\nIn the ﬁltering stage, we focus on developing robust criteria for document quality assess-\nment. This involves a detailed analysis incorporating both linguistic and semantic evaluations,\nproviding a view of data quality from individual and global perspectives. In the remixing phase,\nwe adjust our approach to address data imbalances, focusing on increasing the presence of\nunderrepresented domains. This adjustment aims to achieve a more balanced and inclusive\ndataset, ensuring that diverse perspectives and information are adequately represented.\nFor our tokenizer, we implemented the Byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BBPE) algorithm\nbased on the tokenizers library (Huggingface Team, 2019).
