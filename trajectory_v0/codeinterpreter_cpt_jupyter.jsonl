厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\n\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\n\n    零零幺。\n\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\n\n    “滴滴滴——”\n\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\n\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\n\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\n\n    “哦呼……”\n\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\n\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\n\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\n\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\n\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\n\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\n\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\n\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\n\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\n\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\n\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\n\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\n\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\n\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\n\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\n\n    ……\n\n    ……\n\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\n\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\n\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\n\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\n\n    “呜——”\n\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\n\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\n\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\n\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\n\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\n\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\n\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\n\n    是在与自己说话么？\n\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\n\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\n\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\n\n    这算是什么问题？\n\n    答案当然是存在。\n\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\n\n    原因也很简单。\n\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\n\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\n\n    顾慎回头。\n\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\n\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\n\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\n\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\n\n    顾慎怔了怔。\n\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\n\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\n\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\n\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\n\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\n\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\n\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\n\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\n\n    “噗嗤。”\n\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\n\n    没有想象中的触碰。\n\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\n\n    “顾慎……”\n\n    “……活下去。”\n\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\n\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\n\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\n\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\n\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\n\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\n\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\n\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\n\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\n\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\n\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\n\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\n\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\n\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\n\n    23点59分。\n\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\n\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\n\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\n\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\n\n    活下去。\n\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\n\n    就在目光掠去之时。\n\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\n\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\n\n    “这位先生。”\n\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\n\n    “您……请讲。”\n\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\n\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\n\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\n\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\n\n    “就在刚刚。”\n\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\n\n    ……\n\n    ……\n\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\n\n===第二章

零零幺===\n\n23点44分。\n\n    空空荡荡的轻轨站，顾慎一边飞奔，一边低头瞥了眼手表。\n\n    还能赶得上末班车么……他有些担忧，但远方立即响起低鸣。\n\n    “轰隆隆——”\n\n    幽暗漆黑隧道里，顷刻间撞出万千缕绚烂光弧，最后一班轻轨列车，缓缓降速，平稳停靠在顾慎面前。\n\n    看到列车，顾慎刚刚松了口气，紧接着又皱起眉头，屏住呼吸。\n\n    厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\n\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\n\n    零零幺。\n\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\n\n    “滴滴滴——”\n\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\n\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\n\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\n\n    “哦呼……”\n\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\n\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\n\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\n\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\n\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\n\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\n\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\n\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\n\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\n\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\n\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\n\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\n\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\n\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\n\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\n\n    ……\n\n    ……\n\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\n\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\n\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\n\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\n\n    “呜——”\n\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\n\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\n\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\n\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\n\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\n\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\n\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\n\n    是在与自己说话么？\n\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\n\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\n\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\n\n    这算是什么问题？\n\n    答案当然是存在。\n\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\n\n    原因也很简单。\n\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\n\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\n\n    顾慎回头。\n\n

“它最后出现在……轻轨13号线，列车最后一段路程很长，它无法下车。”风衣女子看了眼时间，轻声地说：“如果抄近道，能够赶在隧道出口拦住它。”\n\n    魏述早已亲自等候在控制台前，听到13号线的那一刻，立即亲手调取了沿途几条主干道的监控，放慢了倍速，果然看到了那鬼魅如幽灵一般的影子……那道影子撞破闸门，逃脱之后，一路向着大藤市的郊区方向逃窜。\n\n    “你想拦住它，一个人？”魏述皱眉，“抓捕A级逃犯不是小事，我建议你直接求助树先生。”\n\n    “来不及了。老师很忙……如果你能保证后援，那么这件事我能搞定。”南槿望向魏述，冷冷地问道：“更何况，你等得了吗？错失这次机会，下次锁定……可就不知道是什么时候了。”\n\n    这个女人很敏锐。\n\n    魏述神情阴沉，对方说得没错……这是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。\n\n    而且看样子，A-009是铁了心想逃离大藤，今夜之后，想要追捕，无异于大海捞针。\n\n    “那就……行动！你只要能够拦住A-009，我会保障足够的后援！”\n\n    魏述下定决心，同时心\n"}], "index": "55", "category1": "文本挖掘\n（jieba、wordcloud）", "category2": "数据文本挖掘", "category3":

However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath , which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM3and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM .\n1 Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signiﬁcant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1–4], coding [ 5–13] and math [ 14–19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further ﬁne-\ntuning with speciﬁc instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks.

Human raters compared model generations on ~4k\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts.\nThe 95% conﬁdence intervals for this evaluation are between\n1% and 2%. More details in Section 3.4.2. While reviewing\nthese results, it is important to note that human evaluations\ncan be noisy due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity\nof the review guidelines, subjectivity of individual raters,\nand the inherent di\u0000culty of comparing generations.\nFigure 2: Win-rate % for helpfulness and\nsafety between commercial-licensed base-\nlines and L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , according to GPT-\n4. To complement the human evaluation, we\nused a more capable model, not subject to\nour own guidance. Green area indicates our\nmodel is better according to GPT-4. To remove\nties, we used win/ (win +loss). The orders in\nwhich the model responses are presented to\nGPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\ncomplex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of ﬁelds, including in specialized\ndomains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n(Ho\u0000mann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily ﬁne-tuned to align with human\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require signiﬁcant costs in\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and ﬁne-tuned LLMs, L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 and\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-speciﬁc data\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our ﬁne-tuning methodology and approach to improving\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce ﬁne-tuned LLMs and\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 andL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , such as\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\n3Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 compared to other open-source and closed-\nsource models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is\nimportant to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the\nprompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these\nsafety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 models.\nWe are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\n1.L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 , an updated version of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 , trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 with\n7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper\nbut are not releasing.§\n2.L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , a ﬁne-tuned version of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net beneﬁt to society. Like all LLMs,\nL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 , developers should perform\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their speciﬁc applications of the model. We provide a responsible use\nguide¶and code examples\u0000to facilitate the safe deployment of L\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 andL\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000-C\u0000\u0000\u0000 .
