This can provide insights into seasonality or other patterns that might influence the predictive model.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Perform a descriptive statistical analysis\ndescription = weather_data.describe()\n\n# Plotting MaxT and MinT over time\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.plot(weather_data['Date'], weather_data['MaxT'], label='Max Temperature')\nplt.plot(weather_data['Date'], weather_data['MinT'], label='Min Temperature')\nplt.title('Temperature Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature (C)')\nplt.legend()\ntemp_plot_path = './output/temperature_over_time.png'\nplt.savefig(temp_plot_path)\nplt.close()\n\n# Plotting WindSpeed over time\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.plot(weather_data['Date'], weather_data['WindSpeed'], label='Wind Speed', color='orange')\nplt.title('Wind Speed Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Wind Speed (m/s)')\nwind_speed_plot_path = './output/wind_speed_over_time.png'\nplt.savefig(wind_speed_plot_path)\n#plt.show() # Removed as per instructions not to use show()\nprint(f\"![Temperature Over Time]({temp_plot_path})\")\nprint(f\"![Wind Speed Over Time]({wind_speed_plot_path})\")\n\ndescription\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "              MaxT         MinT    WindSpeed    Humidity   Precipitation\ncount  6236.000000  6236.000000  6236.000000  6236.000000    6236.000000\nmean     33.341199    24.734392     2.817957    67.132317       3.425319\nstd       3.267866     3.115697     1.060226    11.310975       8.269220\nmin      21.850000    14.430000     0.490000    30.520000       0.000000\n25%      30.920000    22.400000     2.070000    59.497500       0.000000\n50%      33.030000    25.390000     2.530000    68.245000       0.000000\n75%      35.290000    26.980000     3.390000    75.600000       2.585000\nmax      48.000000    33.000000     7.900000    95.120000     128.300000"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse:\nThe statistical summary provides basic information about the weather data, such as mean, standard deviation, and range for each variable.

Given that we have multiple variables (multivariate time series), I'll choose an appropriate model like Vector AutoRegression (VAR) which can handle this type of data. First, however, it is necessary to check if the data is stationary or not since most time series models require stationarity.\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n\n# Function to perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller test\ndef adf_test(series):\n    result = adfuller(series)\n    labels = ['ADF Test Statistic', 'p-value', '#Lags Used', 'Number of Observations Used']\n    return pd.Series(result[:4], index=labels)\n\n# Apply ADF test on each column except Date\nadf_results = weather_data.drop('Date', axis=1).apply(adf_test)\n\nadf_results\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "NameError: name 'adfuller' is not defined"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse:\nIt seems that the `adfuller` function from the `statsmodels` library is not recognized, which indicates that I may have forgotten to import it or there was an issue with the import statement.\n\nThis Step Todo:\nI will correct the code by ensuring that the `adfuller` function is properly imported from the `statsmodels.tsa.stattools` module and then re-run the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on each weather variable.\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n\n# Function to perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller test\ndef adf_test(series):\n    result = adfuller(series)\n    labels = ['ADF Test Statistic', 'p-value', '#Lags Used', 'Number of Observations Used']\n    return pd.Series(result[:4], index=labels)\n\n# Apply ADF test on each column except Date\nadf_results = weather_data.drop('Date', axis=1).apply(adf_test)\n\nadf_results\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "NameError: name 'adfuller' is not defined"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse:\nThe error persists, indicating that the `adfuller` function is still not being recognized.

The next step will be to prepare the data for time series forecasting by splitting it into training and test sets. Then I'll build a Vector AutoRegression (VAR) model using only the training set.\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.api import VAR\n\n# Splitting data into train and test sets\ntrain_size =

Given the nature of stock market data which can be non-linear and have complex patterns due to various external factors influencing it over time, models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) could be very effective as they are capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.\n\nHowever, implementing an LSTM requires a significant amount of preprocessing including scaling features and reshaping input data into sequences. Considering the complexity and execution constraints within this environment, using Facebook Prophet might be more practical for this task. Prophet is designed for forecasting with daily observations that display patterns on different time scales. It also handles missing data and trend changes well.\n\nBefore proceeding with modeling using Prophet or any other method chosen later based on further analysis or limitations encountered during implementation:\n\n1. Check if there are any duplicate dates.\n2. Ensure no missing values in critical columns ('Date', 'Close') since we'll likely use 'Close' prices for our predictions.\n3.

For simplicity and given typical practices in stock price prediction, I will focus on using 'Close' prices for forecasting future stock prices with Facebook's Prophet model.\n\nBefore training the model, it's important to split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to fit our model, while the test set will help us evaluate its performance on unseen data. We'll reserve the last 20% of observations as our test set.\n\nLet's proceed by splitting our dataset accordingly.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED):\n```python\nfrom fbprophet import Prophet\n\n# Prepare dataframe for Prophet (it requires columns ds and y)\ndf_prophet = google_data.rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Close': 'y'})\n\n# Splitting data into train and test sets (80% train / 20% test)\ntrain_size = int(len(df_prophet) * 0.8)\ntest_size = len(df_prophet) - train_size\ntrain_dataset, test_dataset = df_prophet[0:train_size], df_prophet[train_size:len(df_prophet)]\n\n# Initialize Prophet model\nmodel = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True)\n\n# Fit model with training dataset\nmodel.fit(train_dataset)\n\n# Create dataframe for predictions equal to size of test dataset\nfuture_dates = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=test_size)\n\n# Predict future stock prices\nforecast = model.predict(future_dates)\n\n# Display forecast tail (last few rows) \nforecast.tail()\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fbprophet'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Analyse:\nThe fbprophet module is not installed in the current environment, which prevents us from using Facebook's Prophet model for forecasting.\n\nThis Step Todo:\nSince we cannot use Prophet due to the lack of the required module, I will need to choose an alternative method for time series forecasting. A common and straightforward approach is to use ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which can handle non-stationary data and is well-suited for univariate time series models like stock prices.\n\nBefore applying ARIMA, it's necessary to check if the 'Close' price series is stationary or make it stationary if needed because ARIMA requires a stationary time series.
