In the ad, Karan and Kiara are both dressed like a quintessential Rajinikanth character, wearing shirts, vests, and aviator sunglasses.\\nKaran seems to be having the time of his life delivering the broad performance. One of the most recognisable filmmakers of the country, Karan made a full-fledged acting debut with Anurag Kashyap’s ill-fated 2015 gangster drama Bombay Velvet.

He said in an interview that he is biased towards his old friend Shah Rukh, as he described his ‘irreplaceable’ personality. Shah Rukh delivered the three biggest hits of his career in the same calendar year in 2023, reclaiming his position as the country’s biggest star.\\nKaran has often spoken about the kind of allure that movie stars used to have, and told Forbes that he finds this quality lacking in the actors that have followed. He said, “There is no concept, according to me, of superstardom post the era of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. I feel now there’ll be the age of the actors.”\\nAlso read – After Dharma creative head’s criticism of Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Karan Johar praises 12th Fail: ‘Passed the test with flying colours’\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nKaran said that the idea of celebrity has also evolved, because there are so many different ways in which one can become popular these days. “At one point, celebrity meant a movie star or cricketer. But today, a celebrity can be an Instagrammer or a food vlogger, a fashion influencer or a great author. The lines have blurred. But the nation’s crazy love for Shah Rukh, Salman Aamir, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn… Even Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji, Kajol… When Rani and Kajol came on Koffee with Karan, I could tell the equity they carried because they come from a legacy of 25 years.”\\nKaran added, “Even now, when Rekha walks into an event, heads turn. That’s a movie star. When Aishwarya walks the red carpet at Cannes, when Mr Bachchan is anywhere, they’re movie stars. That mania, that magic is very tough to create in this generation of noise.” Highlighting Shah Rukh, Karan declared, “I don’t think there’s a better conversationalist, a more intelligent mind, a more charming and arresting persona, and an aura that is inexplicable than Shah Rukh Khan. That majestic magnetism only he has. He’s irreplaceable.”\\nKaran said that there will be ‘many actors’ in the future, but ‘there never was and never will be a personality like Shah Rukh Khan’. Karan and Shah Rukh have worked together on films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and My Name is Khan.\\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model.\nWizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH.

A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further ﬁne-\ntuning with speciﬁc instruction data and methods.
