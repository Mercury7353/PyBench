However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model.\nWizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM 3 and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signiÔ¨Åcant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [1‚Äì4], coding [5‚Äì13] and math [14‚Äì19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further Ô¨Åne-\ntuning with speciÔ¨Åc instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta‚Äôs series of Llama [4, 20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [21], StarCoder [12], Alpaca [22],\nVicuna [23], and WizardLM [24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25‚Äì35].\n‚á§\nEqual contribution.
