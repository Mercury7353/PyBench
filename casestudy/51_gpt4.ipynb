Given the nature of stock market data which can be non-linear and have complex patterns due to various external factors influencing it over time, models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) could be very effective as they are capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.\n\nHowever, implementing an LSTM requires a significant amount of preprocessing including scaling features and reshaping input data into sequences. Considering the complexity and execution constraints within this environment, using Facebook Prophet might be more practical for this task. Prophet is designed for forecasting with daily observations that display patterns on different time scales. It also handles missing data and trend changes well.\n\nBefore proceeding with modeling using Prophet or any other method chosen later based on further analysis or limitations encountered during implementation:\n\n1. Check if there are any duplicate dates.\n2. Ensure no missing values in critical columns ('Date', 'Close') since we'll likely use 'Close' prices for our predictions.\n3. Decide whether to use only 'Close' prices or include other features like 'Volume'.\n\nLet's start by checking duplicates in the Date column.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED):"

For simplicity and given typical practices in stock price prediction, I will focus on using 'Close' prices for forecasting future stock prices with Facebook's Prophet model.\n\nBefore training the model, it's important to split the data into a training set and a test set.

A common and straightforward approach is to use ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which can handle non-stationary data and is well-suited for univariate time series models like stock prices.\n\nBefore applying ARIMA, it's necessary to check if the 'Close' price series is stationary or make it stationary if needed because ARIMA requires a stationary time series.

A comparison between observed and predicted values was made for the test dataset. Additionally, a plot illustrating both observed and predicted stock prices over time has been created and saved at `./output/google_stock_price_prediction.png`. The performance of the model was quantified using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which would help in understanding how closely the predictions match actual values. However, these specific error metric results were not provided in this context but can be found within the executed code's output if needed."
