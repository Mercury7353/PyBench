The MAPE gives the average percentage error in the predictions.\n\nWhile the MSE and RMSE are commonly used to evaluate regression models, the MAE and MAPE provide a more interpretable measure of the model's performance. The lower these values, the better the model's performance.\n\nBased on these metrics, the model's predictions are relatively accurate, with a low MAPE of 0.55%. However, it's important to note that stock price prediction is a challenging task, and no model can accurately predict future stock prices with complete certainty."
