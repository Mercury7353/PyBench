Evaluating both agents' solutions based on the provided dimensions:

### Agent 1's Solution Evaluation

- **Reasoning Quality**: 8
  - Agent 1 provided a clear explanation of the process to divide the image into four equal parts horizontally. The reasoning included steps like reading the image, calculating the width of each part, and using numpy to split the image. However, the initial error handling could have been more proactive by checking if the width is divisible by 4 before attempting to split.

- **Code Quality**: 7
  - The code correctly implements the solution described in the reasoning. However, the initial code resulted in a `ValueError` due to the width not being divisible by 4, which was later fixed by resizing the image. The solution could have been more efficient by avoiding resizing if the width was already divisible by 4.

### Agent 2's Solution Evaluation

- **Reasoning Quality**: 6
  - Agent 2's reasoning process covers the necessary steps to divide the image but lacks clarity in explaining the error handling and debugging process. The initial solution approach was somewhat flawed, as concatenating the parts vertically (`cv2.vconcat`) does not match the user's request to divide the image horizontally.

- **Code Quality**: 5
  - The code provided by Agent 2 contains a syntax error due to an unmatched ']', which was pointed out by the user. The debugging process mentioned does not directly address the problem in the code snippet provided for dividing the image into four parts. Additionally, the approach to concatenate image parts vertically does not fulfill the user's request accurately.

### Total Scores

Evaluating both solutions based on the provided dimensions:

### Agent 1's Solution:

**Reasoning Quality: 8/10**
Agent 1 provides a clear explanation of the process to flip an image horizontally using OpenCV. The reasoning includes a step-by-step guide that covers reading the image, flipping it, and saving the flipped image. However, the explanation about displaying the image using `plt.imshow()` and then saving it using `plt.savefig()` might confuse users since the final action should focus on saving the image directly as per the user's request.

**Code Quality: 7/10**
The code is expected to fulfill the user's query by flipping the image and saving it. However, the actual code snippet is not provided in the response, making it difficult to evaluate the correctness fully. The explanation suggests using both `cv2.imwrite()` and `plt.savefig()` for saving the image, which is redundant. Following the user's instructions strictly, `plt.savefig()` should be the preferred method for consistency with the system's requirements.

### Agent 2's Solution:

**Reasoning Quality: 9/10**
Agent 2 provides a detailed explanation of the process, including the use of `cv2.flip()` for flipping the image horizontally. The reasoning is enhanced by the inclusion of converting the image from BGR to RGB color space before saving, which is crucial for correct image representation when using matplotlib. This shows a deeper understanding of the interaction between OpenCV and matplotlib.

**Code Quality: 9/10**
The code correctly implements the user's request by flipping the image and saving it using `plt.savefig()`. The comments before each line of code, especially those with multiple pairs of parentheses, provide additional clarity and ensure that the user understands the purpose and necessity of each operation. The code also adheres to the requirement of saving the processed image without showing it, which aligns with the user's instructions.
