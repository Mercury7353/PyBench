{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is good as it correctly identifies the steps needed to process the dataset, including loading the data, removing null values from a specific column ('name'), and analyzing which type of actors are more likely to win an Oscar. However, Agent1 makes an error by initially trying to remove null values from a non-existent 'actor' column but corrects this mistake after checking the actual column names.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also good. It correctly loads the dataset, checks for null values in all columns, removes rows with any null values (which might be too aggressive), and then analyzes which gender of actors are more likely to win an Oscar. The analysis focuses on gender rather than individual actor names or other attributes.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1’s code quality is decent but has some issues:\n- Initially attempts to drop rows based on a non-existent 'actor' column.\n- Focuses on counting Oscars won by each actor without considering other factors like gender or category.\n- Outputs organizations and producers instead of individual actors due to how it processes the 'name' field.\n\nAgent2’s code quality is better:\n- Correctly identifies columns with null values before cleaning.\n- Removes all rows with any missing value (though this could potentially discard useful data).\n- Analyzes winners based on gender distribution effectively.\n\nFinal Decision: \nConsidering both agents’ performance in terms of passing execution without errors and overall approach towards solving the problem:", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 0, "Agent2": 1}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is straightforward but limited. The agent correctly identifies the need to read the CSV file and group the data by certificate, but it stops there without providing any further analysis or output verification.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is more comprehensive. The agent not only reads and groups the data by certificate but also verifies this grouping by displaying a few rows of grouped data. Additionally, Agent2 extracts unique certificate categories and visualizes the distribution of movies across these categories using a bar plot, which provides a clear overview of the data distribution.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code fulfills part of the user query by reading and grouping the data by certificate. However, it does not provide any output or further analysis to verify that this has been done correctly.\n\nAgent2's code goes beyond just fulfilling the basic requirement; it includes steps for verifying that the grouping was successful (by displaying some rows), extracting unique certificates, and visualizing them in a bar plot saved as an image file. This additional work ensures that all aspects of \"grouping\" are covered comprehensively.\n\nSo overall:\n- Agent1’s solution passes because it successfully groups data.\n- Agent2’s solution passes with higher quality due to its thoroughness in verification and visualization.", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 0, "Agent2": 1}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\\n\\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\\n\\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\\n\\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\\n\\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\\n\\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\\n\\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\\n\\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\\n\\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\\n\\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\\n\\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\\n\\n    “呜——”\\n\\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\\n\\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\\n\\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\\n\\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\\n\\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\\n\\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\\n\\n    是在与自己说话么？\\n\\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\\n\\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\\n\\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    这算是什么问题？\\n\\n    答案当然是存在。\\n\\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\\n\\n    原因也很简单。\\n\\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\\n\\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\\n\\n    顾慎回头。\\n\\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\\n\\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\\n\\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\\n\\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔。\\n\\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\\n\\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\\n\\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\\n\\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\\n\\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\\n\\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\\n\\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\\n\\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\\n\\n    “噗嗤。”\\n\\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\\n\\n    没有想象中的触碰。\\n\\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\\n\\n    “顾慎……”\\n\\n    “……活下去。”\\n\\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\\n\\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\\n\\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\\n\\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\\n\\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\\n\\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\\n\\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\\n\\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\\n\\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\\n\\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\\n\\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\\n\\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\\n\\n    23点59分。\\n\\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\\n\\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\\n\\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\\n\\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\\n\\n    活下去。\\n\\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\\n\\n    就在目光掠去之时。\\n\\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\\n\\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\\n\\n    “这位先生。”\\n\\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\\n\\n    “您……请讲。”\\n\\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\\n\\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\\n\\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\\n\\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\\n\\n    “就在刚刚。”\\n\\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\\n\\n===第二章 答案===\\n\\n“闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    “重复一遍，闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    警报响起的这一夜，大藤市的有些人注定不能安眠。\\n\\n    魏述盯着紧急会议室里闪烁的数十片屏幕，神情紧绷，手中紧攥的那份紧急报告被捏出层层叠叠的褶皱。\\n\\n    他额头青筋鼓起，双拳重重抵在控制台前，无法理解：“闸门怎么会被突破？监狱里那么多的看守者，A-009是怎么逃脱的？”\\n\\n    “大藤市接手A-009才三天，就出现了逃狱事件，紧急报告上说闸门破碎是‘深海’的网络问题……可是‘深海’怎么会出问题？”\\n\\n    魏述转头望向身后：“不论如何，现在它已经逃了。南槿女士，你是负责押送A-009的专员，应该很清楚……这东西逃逸之后的危险吧？我们要尽快将它再次收容关押！”\\n\\n    会议室门口，一位红色长发女子，穿着黑色宽大风衣，此刻双手搭在脑后，正在盘绕长发。\\n\\n    她没有回应魏述，而是平静凝视着那一片片闪烁的屏幕。\\n\\n    数十位工作人员各自负责一片屏幕，每片屏幕都被切割成数十块，从闸门到收容城的所有监控全都被调取出来，但是没人发现异常……闸门破碎的警报传出之后，A-009仿佛就人间蒸发了一般，这片监控网能够捕捉到一只蚊子飞过的痕迹，却无法捕捉到A-009的一根头发。\\n\\n    南槿缓缓盘着长发。\\n\\n

零零幺===\\n\\n23点44分。\\n\\n    空空荡荡的轻轨站，顾慎一边飞奔，一边低头瞥了眼手表。\\n\\n    还能赶得上末班车么……他有些担忧，但远方立即响起低鸣。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    幽暗漆黑隧道里，顷刻间撞出万千缕绚烂光弧，最后一班轻轨列车，缓缓降速，平稳停靠在顾慎面前。\\n\\n    看到列车，顾慎刚刚松了口气，紧接着又皱起眉头，屏住呼吸。\\n\\n    厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\\n\\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\\n\\n    零零幺。\\n\\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\\n\\n    “滴滴滴——”\\n\\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\\n\\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\\n\\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\\n\\n    “哦呼……”\\n\\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\\n\\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\\n\\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\\n\\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\\n\\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\\n\\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\\n\\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\\n\\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\\n\\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\\n\\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\\n\\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\\n\\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\\n\\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\\n\\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\\n\\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\\n\\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\\n\\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\\n\\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\\n\\n    “呜——”\\n\\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\\n\\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\\n\\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\\n\\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\\n\\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\\n\\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\\n\\n    是在与自己说话么？\\n\\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\\n\\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\\n\\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    这算是什么问题？\\n\\n    答案当然是存在。\\n\\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\\n\\n    原因也很简单。\\n\\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\\n\\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\\n\\n    顾慎回头。\\n\\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\\n\\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\\n\\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\\n\\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔。\\n\\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\\n\\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\\n\\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\\n\\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\\n\\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\\n\\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\\n\\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\\n\\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\\n\\n    “噗嗤。”\\n\\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\\n\\n    没有想象中的触碰。\\n\\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\\n\\n    “顾慎……”\\n\\n    “……活下去。”\\n\\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\\n\\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\\n\\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\\n\\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\\n\\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\\n\\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\\n\\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\\n\\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\\n\\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\\n\\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\\n\\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\\n\\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\\n\\n    23点59分。\\n\\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\\n\\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\\n\\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\\n\\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\\n\\n    活下去。\\n\\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\\n\\n    就在目光掠去之时。\\n\\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\\n\\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\\n\\n    “这位先生。”\\n\\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\\n\\n    “您……请讲。”\\n\\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\\n\\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\\n\\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\\n\\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\\n\\n    “就在刚刚。”\\n\\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\\n\\n===第二章 答案===\\n\\n“闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    “重复一遍，闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    警报响起的这一夜，大藤市的有些人注定不能安眠。\\n\\n    魏述盯着紧急会议室里闪烁的数十片屏幕，神情紧绷，手中紧攥的那份紧急报告被捏出层层叠叠的褶皱。\\n\\n    他额头青筋鼓起，双拳重重抵在控制台前，无法理解：“闸门怎么会被突破？监狱里那么多的看守者，A-009是怎么逃脱的？”\\n\\n    “大藤市接手A-009才三天，就出现了逃狱事件，紧急报告上说闸门破碎是‘深海’的网络问题……可是‘深海’怎么会出问题？”\\n\\n    魏述转头望向身后：“不论如何，现在它已经逃了。南槿女士，你是负责押送A-009的专员，应该很清楚……这东西逃逸之后的危险吧？我们要尽快将它再次收容关押！”\\n\\n    会议室门口，一位红色长发女子，穿着黑色宽大风衣，此刻双手搭在脑后，正在盘绕长发。\\n\\n    她没有回应魏述，而是平静凝视着那一片片闪烁的屏幕。\\n\\n    数十位工作人员各自负责一片屏幕，每片屏幕都被切割成数十块，从闸门到收容城的所有监控全都被调取出来，但是没人发现异常……闸门破碎的警报传出之后，A-009仿佛就人间蒸发了一般，这片监控网能够捕捉到一只蚊子飞过的痕迹，却无法捕捉到A-009的一根头发。\\n\\n    南槿缓缓盘着长发。\\n\\n    她的目光变得漆黑，无神，与此同时数十片屏幕，数百幕监控发散的光源，在她眼中骤然变得缓慢。\\n\\n    并不是A-009真的消失了。\\n\\n    它并不具备瞬间移动这样的能力，只是速度太快了，快到……这些寻常的工作人员，如果不放慢倍速，根本无法捕捉到移动轨迹。\\n\\n    注意到南槿眼中光线的变化，魏述神情凝重抬起手，做了个手势，示意手下操作人员安静，不要打扰南槿的观察。\\n\\n    整座会议室鸦雀无声。\\n\\n    最终南槿锁定了一片屏幕，在放慢了接近二十倍的视野中，A-009的影子出现，像是一片群鸦笼罩的阴翳，即便目光沾染，便会觉得心头压抑。\\n\\n    女子目光缓慢顺延，从一片屏幕挪移到另外一片屏幕，同时在脑海地图中，刻画出一条蜿蜒曲折的逃脱轨迹。\\n\\n    凝视过程中，那双无神的瞳孔缓缓流出两行清泪。\\n\\n    “它最后出现在……轻轨13号线，列车最后一段路程很长，它无法下车。”风衣女子看了眼时间，轻声地说：“如果抄近道，能够赶在隧道出口拦住它。”\\n\\n    魏述早已亲自等候在控制台前，听到13号线的那一刻，立即亲手调取了沿途几条主干道的监控，放慢了倍速，果然看到了那鬼魅如幽灵一般的影子……那道影子撞破闸门，逃脱之后，一路向着大藤市的郊区方向逃窜。\\n\\n    “你想拦住它，一个人？”魏述皱眉，“抓捕A级逃犯不是小事，我建议你直接求助树先生。”\\n\\n    “来不及了。老师很忙……如果你能保证后援，那么这件事我能搞定。”南槿望向魏述，冷冷地问道：“更何况，你等得了吗？错失这次机会，下次锁定……可就不知道是什么时候了。”\\n\\n    这个女人很敏锐。\\n\\n    魏述神情阴沉，对方说得没错……这是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。\\n\\n    而且看样子，A-009是铁了心想逃离大藤，今夜之后，想要追捕，无异于大海捞针。\\n\\n    “那就……行动！你只要能够拦住A-009，我会保障足够的后援！”\\n\\n    魏述下定决心，同时心底有些释然，幸好是13号线……这个时间段，这种驶向偏远郊区的轻轨，不会有人乘坐。\\n\\n    “等等……那是什么？”\\n\\n    “放大。”\\n\\n    “再放大。”\\n\\n    魏述忽然看到最后的监控视线中，出现了一个飞奔的黑点。\\n\\n    与此同时，他的头上同时也出现了一串黑线……那段监控图像放大之后，能够模糊看见，画面中一个约莫十七八岁的少年，一路飞奔，赶在轻轨关闭之前，登上了这辆本该驶走的末班列车。\\n\\n    这是哪个倒霉蛋？\\n\\n    “……”魏述望向南槿：“还能救吗？”\\n\\n    风衣女子沉默。\\n\\n    “13号线会经过一段很长的隧道。他至少会和A-009共处……20分钟。”南槿低头看了眼手表，面无表情地说了个冷笑话，“我赶到的时候，应该是热乎的。”\\n\\n    魏述神情复杂，他是阅读过档案的知情人，很清楚与A-009共处20分钟意味着什么。\\n\\n    还能热乎的话，已经不错了。\\n\\n    替这个少年送上默哀。\\n\\n    紧接着，他收敛神情，深吸一口气，将这些杂念抛在脑后，眼下最重要的是指挥接下来的收容工作，他选择了孤注一掷，已经没有退路，今夜必须顺利收容A-009，这样才能将损失降到最小……\\n\\n    “链接‘深海’，开放权限，我需要协助。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音回荡在控制室内。\\n\\n    说到深海两个字的时候，这位负责人眼神不由凝重起来，这次后方呈递的紧急报告认为，A-009脱狱的起因，是深海运转的失误。\\n\\n    魏述实在无法全部相信这份报告。\\n\\n    因为“深海”，这片覆盖串联整座东洲的巨大网络，已经紧密周全地运转了20余年，在过往的数百万起事件运算中，完美完成所有任务，从未出现一次错误……而这一次，他情愿相信是工作人员的误报，事实上每年总有误报，后来也总会被证实是人工失误。\\n\\n    大屏幕上黯淡下来，出现了层层海浪席卷冲刷的等待图，右下角的加载特效很复古，仔细去看，会发现那是一个模糊的，由马赛克拼凑而成的少女，在沙滩上踩着沙粒原地奔跑。\\n\\n    魏述叩着手指，很有耐心地等待。\\n\\n    最终满室生辉，一道清脆悦耳的温柔声音在控制室内响起。\\n\\n    “深海已链接……序号V349708069527，很高兴为您服务。”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    灯光昏暗。\\n\\n    列车颠簸。\\n\\n    这班轻轨，是一条撞向破碎夜幕尽头的长蛇。\\n\\n    而顾慎就在蛇的肚子里，他看到那位高大夫人的双眼了，与正常人截然不同，散发着红光的是两枚蛇一般的竖瞳，细长如剑。\\n\\n    夫人的声音，回荡在轻轨空荡荡的车厢中。\\n\\n    “是的……很显然，您触摸到了。”\\n\\n    而顾慎的回答，紧随其后，他额头有冷汗渗出，声音也在颤抖，但此刻的意识却前所未有的清醒。\\n\\n    一手触摸戒尺，一手攥拢锋刀。\\n\\n    高大礼服女人怔了怔，似乎有些失望。\\n\\n    她停顿了一刹，继续礼貌性地追问：“那么……为什么呢？”\\n\\n    顾慎在昏暗炽光中，紧紧盯住夫人膝前沾染血迹的旧报纸，他试图看清那张报纸上的内容，但光线太暗，无法看清。\\n\\n    顾慎轻声笑道：“夫人……恕我直言，不是每一件事物都能被完美的具象化体现，但当我们触碰更大的领域，我们拥有的，只会比想象中更多。3和4之间已经囊括了无限。”\\n\\n    高大礼服女人蛇形瞳孔中的红芒，隐约闪动了一下。\\n\\n    她动了动嘴唇，似乎笑了。\\n\\n    看到这抹笑，顾慎只觉得毛骨悚然，他保持着相对安全的距离，向前缓缓挪进，那股笼罩心头的压迫感至今没有散去。\\n\\n    他毫不怀疑，自己说错一句话，乃至一个字……都会触发这位礼服女人拔刀的条件。\\n\\n    于是他只能保持沉默，在沉默的宁静中，缓缓靠近女人。\\n\\n    那张报纸，是自己唯一能够了解对方的信息媒介，如果能够看到，或许会有帮助。\\n\\n    可是夫人口中只是轻轻吐出了两个字：“继续。”\\n\\n    “……π是一个无限不循环的常数，这意味着它拥有无止境的精度，而在有限精度的尺子上，没有任何一个点，可以标记出π。”\\n\\n    顾慎一边开口，试图稳住对方，同时缓缓蹲下身子，在逼仄空间中抬头，仰视高大女人，这句话似乎触怒了对方，女人唇角的笑意顷刻间消失，眼神也变得如蛇一般冰冷。\\n\\n    她握住了剔骨刀，整辆轻轨都翻涌冰冷入骨的寒风。\\n\\n    也正是在这一刻，顾慎看到了风中颤抖的报纸，还有猩红的血字……那是一连串的数字符号，还有证明公式。\\n\\n    有些眼熟的。\\n\\n    他在哪见过的。\\n\\n    大脑在疯狂运转。\\n\\n    顾慎回想着自己第一眼看到女人的场景，那时候她在看报纸……神情如痴如醉。\\n\\n    原来，原来如此。\\n\\n    “可即便如此，我依然坚信，在3和4之间，能够触摸π。”\\n\\n    顾慎抬头，声音有些沙哑。\\n\\n    “夫人……至于其中原因，你我都知道的，不是吗？”\\n\\n    “艾伦.图灵。”\\n\\n    在顾慎念出这个人名的时候，高大夫人的身躯显然一震。\\n\\n    她讶异地凝视顾慎。\\n\\n    是的，顾慎找到了“答案”……夫人让自己说下去，不是想听到证明过程，而是想寻求共同的志向。\\n\\n    那张报纸上密密麻麻的数学符号、证明公式，所指向的最终点，也正是高大夫人眼中怀揣狂热所膜拜顶礼的对象。\\n\\n    她想听到的，不过是这个人名而已。\\n\\n    艾伦.图灵。\\n\\n    那位赫赫有名，缔造深海网络的伟大人物，很少有人知道，他也是一位数学家，而在数学的领域中，π在3和4的集合之内，轻易便可触摸。\\n\\n    在物理的领域中，π反倒像是不存在的虚构数字，无法被触碰，更不可被刻度指代。\\n\\n    这个名字说出口后。\\n\\n    轻轨寒冷的风忽然熄灭了。\\n\\n    闪烁的灯光好像也随之熄灭了。\\n\\n    夫人的神情变得柔和起来，她伸出一只手，似乎是想扶起顾慎，但袖中滑出了一枚尺子，那是先前她比划的银色戒尺。\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔，下意识伸手接过尺子。\\n\\n    下一刻——\\n\\n    通过尺子连接的两人分开。\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道。\\n\\n    呜咽狂风灌顶而下，失重感陡然袭来，顾慎不受控制地抛飞，捏着尺子，重重摔在地上。\\n\\n    “咚！”\\n\\n    顾慎面色一变，听到了一声闷响，像是有什么重物狠狠摔在轻轨车厢之上，自己头顶之上，竟被踩出了一对肉眼可见的脚印——\\n\\n    千万蓬火光电弧迸溅。\\n\\n    伴随着刺耳尖锐的轰鸣，一柄长刀，斜着穿透车厢铁皮，无比精准地刺入高大礼服女人的肩头，像是一枚钉子，将高大女人死死钉在车厢一侧。\\n\\n    紧接着第二把刀插入车厢顶部，刀刃旋转，如同切纸，车厢顶部的一大块铁皮脱落，一个披着大风衣的红发女人踏着铁皮轰然降落。\\n\\n    南槿就落在顾慎正前方。\\n\\n    她眯起双眼，回首瞥了眼自己身后搂着衣服跌坐的少年，冷静无比地汇报。\\n\\n    “魏述……那个倒霉蛋还活着。”\\n\\n    倒霉蛋，这个称呼还不错，至少很恰当……顾慎龇牙咧嘴，搂着铁栏杆稳住身子，刚刚那一下太疼了，屁股像是摔成了八瓣。\\n\\n    现在浑身上下的感受，除了疼，就是眩晕。\\n\\n    他小心翼翼将尺子摄在怀中，藏在衣襟内侧，这枚戒尺触摸之时，出乎意料的清凉，让他变得格外清醒。\\n\\n    而被钉在车厢一侧的黑色礼服女人，此刻则是异常愤怒，她伸出一只手，攥向南槿钉在自己体内的长刀，想要将其拔出。\\n\\n    “嗤——”\\n\\n    在她五根手指触摸长刀的一刻，刀刃暴燃，炽亮银光照亮整节车厢！\\n\\n    夫人痛苦尖啸，不得不松开手掌。\\n\\n    那把银刃燃烧着炽烈光火，但光焰也在迅速黯淡——\\n\\n    显然时间有限。\\n\\n    但此时南槿没有动手，而是选择了等待。\\n\\n    她在等待魏述的指示。\\n\\n    电流沙沙。\\n\\n    “转移作战地点，先解救这个叫‘顾慎’的少年。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音响起，一字一句，不带感情：\\n\\n    “不要在列车上与A-009战斗，这是深海给出的最优解。”\\n\\n===第三章 恶战===\\n\\n深海给出的最优解，是先解救这个少年么？\\n\\n    其实听到这个回答，南槿并不觉得意外。\\n\\n    她很清楚，与A-009共处20分钟相安无事，意味着什么……这可是一个危险程度抵达A级的失控者。\\n\\n    能做到这一点，可不是普通的运气好就能解释。\\n\\n    资料上显示，A-009疯狂追寻着某个常人无法理解的真理。\\n\\n    顾慎能和她和平共处，不可能是意外……难道说，这个少年也是个疯子？\\n\\n    来不及多想。\\n\\n    魏述的声音再一次响起：“我将切断这节车厢，接下来你需要带着他脱离。”\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    轻轨在大藤市郊区的夜风中撒野疾驰，一道沉闷的断裂声音响起，这节车厢抛开了与身后其他车厢的连接挂钩，轮毂在剧烈摩擦声中抱紧，由于惯性缘故，整节车厢从底部开始“缓缓”腾空。\\n\\n    南槿面无表情：“抱紧我。”\\n\\n    顾慎：“？？？”\\n\\n    他猛地一个前扑，毫不客气抱住南槿的纤腰，宽大风衣下是一具温热纤细的躯干，顾慎摸到了好几道冰冷硌手的修长轮廓……这个女人腰间还悬挂着三把长短刀。\\n\\n    联想到先前切割列车的寒光，他情不自禁打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    一个颠簸！\\n\\n    列车车厢几乎腾空，两个人踩在车厢底部，以近乎垂直于地面的角度向下滑掠。\\n\\n    南槿速度极快地踏出碎步，完全不像是腰间缠着大汉，因为车厢倒飞掀起之故，此刻的她像是飞檐走壁的一只夜猫，整个世界都被逆转，唯独她保持平衡。\\n\\n    屏息敛神，双手持刀递斩十字。\\n\\n    炽亮的刀芒照破黑暗。\\n\\n    “铛铛铛”三声脆响！\\n\\n    剔骨刀格挡了刀锋！\\n\\n    但夫人喉咙中再一次响起痛苦的低吼，就连顾慎都能看到，那敞开的黑色大礼服中，飘出的那一连串鲜红血珠。\\n\\n    拔刀那一刻，南槿眼瞳中的所有色泽便全都褪去，化为一片冰冷。\\n\\n    她并不贪胜，虽然抵斩之后成功突破，一刀精准扎入高大女士的胸口，但得手便立即回身，千钧一发之际，南槿一只手闪电般掠出，五根手指紧紧攥住顾慎后衣领，在车厢彻底翻滚90度的时候猛地下蹲，重重一靴踩碎钢化玻璃，像是潜游的潜水者向下沉去。\\n\\n    破碎的玻璃，翻滚的电弧，像是深海里漂浮的海草。\\n\\n    而脱轨的车厢则像是一枚上升的潜艇，只是这里是陆地，而不是海洋。\\n\\n    车厢翻滚，从轨道上抛飞，如同落坡巨石，势不可挡地撞击地面，不断碰撞，滑掠出千万蓬绚烂弧光，倾翻前的最后一刻，夜幕中两道身影险而又险地跳出，落在一块草坪之上。\\n\\n    南槿拍了拍风衣灰尘，她目光视线始终紧紧盯着那远方滑出四五百米的破碎车厢，摔出轨道之后，那节车厢没有动静，一片死寂。\\n\\n    烟尘升腾，她没有掉以轻心，而是从腰间拔出第三把长刀，同时冷冷汇报：“目标已救出……A-009仍在车厢里。”\\n\\n    魏述很快给出回复：“封锁周边，后援很快就到，不要让它逃脱。”\\n\\n    南槿轻轻嗯了一声。\\n\\n    “咔嚓……”\\n\\n    视线捕捉到那节车厢在死寂之后，轻微动弹了一下……南槿立即反手握住第四把刀，将其拔出，双手持刀之后，安心了许多，但总觉得身上不太舒服。\\n\\n    南槿低头，发现了原因：“你还要抱到什么时候？”\\n\\n    “可以多抱会么？”某位少年很没有骨气地抱紧大腿，腆着脸皮蹭了蹭，挤出谄媚的笑：“大哥……我好怕啊。”\\n\\n    这副表情，真的是怕么？\\n\\n    明明自己切开车厢的时候，这家伙还和A-009谈笑风生。\\n\\n    “A-009的能力是腐化。”南槿面无表情：“通常情况下……她能够污染肢体接触的物事，包括但不仅限于刀，剑，金属，枪械……还有人。”\\n\\n    顾慎回想列车最后一幕，礼服女人微笑对着自己伸出手的画面，忍不住打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    腐化？\\n\\n    这也太吓人了……自己还接了那把尺子，不会有事吧？\\n\\n    “刚刚的交战，我可不确定，这衣服有没有与它有过接触。”\\n\\n    南槿轻描淡写的一句话，顾慎烫手一般撒开风衣。\\n\\n    “大哥接下来还有一场恶战啊，加油加油……”顾慎一边打气，一边小心翼翼\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Analyse: The

零零幺===\\n\\n23点44分。\\n\\n    空空荡荡的轻轨站，顾慎一边飞奔，一边低头瞥了眼手表。\\n\\n    还能赶得上末班车么……他有些担忧，但远方立即响起低鸣。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    幽暗漆黑隧道里，顷刻间撞出万千缕绚烂光弧，最后一班轻轨列车，缓缓降速，平稳停靠在顾慎面前。\\n\\n    看到列车，顾慎刚刚松了口气，紧接着又皱起眉头，屏住呼吸。\\n\\n    厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\\n\\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\\n\\n    零零幺。\\n\\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\\n\\n    “滴滴滴——”\\n\\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\\n\\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\\n\\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\\n\\n    “哦呼……”\\n\\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\\n\\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\\n\\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\\n\\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\\n\\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\\n\\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\\n\\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\\n\\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\\n\\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\\n\\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\\n\\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\\n\\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\\n\\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\\n\\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\\n\\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\\n\\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\\n\\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\\n\\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\\n\\n    “呜——”\\n\\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\\n\\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\\n\\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\\n\\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\\n\\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\\n\\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\\n\\n    是在与自己说话么？\\n\\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\\n\\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\\n\\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    这算是什么问题？\\n\\n    答案当然是存在。\\n\\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\\n\\n    原因也很简单。\\n\\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\\n\\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\\n\\n    顾慎回头。\\n\\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\\n\\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\\n\\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\\n\\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔。\\n\\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\\n\\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\\n\\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\\n\\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\\n\\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\\n\\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\\n\\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\\n\\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\\n\\n    “噗嗤。”\\n\\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\\n\\n    没有想象中的触碰。\\n\\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\\n\\n    “顾慎……”\\n\\n    “……活下去。”\\n\\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\\n\\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\\n\\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\\n\\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\\n\\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\\n\\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\\n\\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\\n\\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\\n\\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\\n\\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\\n\\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\\n\\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\\n\\n    23点59分。\\n\\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\\n\\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\\n\\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\\n\\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\\n\\n    活下去。\\n\\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\\n\\n    就在目光掠去之时。\\n\\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\\n\\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\\n\\n    “这位先生。”\\n\\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\\n\\n    “您……请讲。”\\n\\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\\n\\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\\n\\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\\n\\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\\n\\n    “就在刚刚。”\\n\\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\\n\\n===第二章 答案===\\n\\n“闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    “重复一遍，闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    警报响起的这一夜，大藤市的有些人注定不能安眠。\\n\\n    魏述盯着紧急会议室里闪烁的数十片屏幕，神情紧绷，手中紧攥的那份紧急报告被捏出层层叠叠的褶皱。\\n\\n    他额头青筋鼓起，双拳重重抵在控制台前，无法理解：“闸门怎么会被突破？监狱里那么多的看守者，A-009是怎么逃脱的？”\\n\\n    “大藤市接手A-009才三天，就出现了逃狱事件，紧急报告上说闸门破碎是‘深海’的网络问题……可是‘深海’怎么会出问题？”\\n\\n    魏述转头望向身后：“不论如何，现在它已经逃了。南槿女士，你是负责押送A-009的专员，应该很清楚……这东西逃逸之后的危险吧？我们要尽快将它再次收容关押！”\\n\\n    会议室门口，一位红色长发女子，穿着黑色宽大风衣，此刻双手搭在脑后，正在盘绕长发。\\n\\n    她没有回应魏述，而是平静凝视着那一片片闪烁的屏幕。\\n\\n    数十位工作人员各自负责一片屏幕，每片屏幕都被切割成数十块，从闸门到收容城的所有监控全都被调取出来，但是没人发现异常……闸门破碎的警报传出之后，A-009仿佛就人间蒸发了一般，这片监控网能够捕捉到一只蚊子飞过的痕迹，却无法捕捉到A-009的一根头发。\\n\\n    南槿缓缓盘着长发。\\n\\n    她的目光变得漆黑，无神，与此同时数十片屏幕，数百幕监控发散的光源，在她眼中骤然变得缓慢。\\n\\n    并不是A-009真的消失了。\\n\\n    它并不具备瞬间移动这样的能力，只是速度太快了，快到……这些寻常的工作人员，如果不放慢倍速，根本无法捕捉到移动轨迹。\\n\\n    注意到南槿眼中光线的变化，魏述神情凝重抬起手，做了个手势，示意手下操作人员安静，不要打扰南槿的观察。\\n\\n    整座会议室鸦雀无声。\\n\\n    最终南槿锁定了一片屏幕，在放慢了接近二十倍的视野中，A-009的影子出现，像是一片群鸦笼罩的阴翳，即便目光沾染，便会觉得心头压抑。\\n\\n    女子目光缓慢顺延，从一片屏幕挪移到另外一片屏幕，同时在脑海地图中，刻画出一条蜿蜒曲折的逃脱轨迹。\\n\\n    凝视过程中，那双无神的瞳孔缓缓流出两行清泪。\\n\\n    “它最后出现在……轻轨13号线，列车最后一段路程很长，它无法下车。”风衣女子看了眼时间，轻声地说：“如果抄近道，能够赶在隧道出口拦住它。”\\n\\n    魏述早已亲自等候在控制台前，听到13号线的那一刻，立即亲手调取了沿途几条主干道的监控，放慢了倍速，果然看到了那鬼魅如幽灵一般的影子……那道影子撞破闸门，逃脱之后，一路向着大藤市的郊区方向逃窜。\\n\\n    “你想拦住它，一个人？”魏述皱眉，“抓捕A级逃犯不是小事，我建议你直接求助树先生。”\\n\\n    “来不及了。老师很忙……如果你能保证后援，那么这件事我能搞定。”南槿望向魏述，冷冷地问道：“更何况，你等得了吗？错失这次机会，下次锁定……可就不知道是什么时候了。”\\n\\n    这个女人很敏锐。\\n\\n    魏述神情阴沉，对方说得没错……这是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。\\n\\n    而且看样子，A-009是铁了心想逃离大藤，今夜之后，想要追捕，无异于大海捞针。\\n\\n    “那就……行动！你只要能够拦住A-009，我会保障足够的后援！”\\n\\n    魏述下定决心，同时心底有些释然，幸好是13号线……这个时间段，这种驶向偏远郊区的轻轨，不会有人乘坐。\\n\\n    “等等……那是什么？”\\n\\n    “放大。”\\n\\n    “再放大。”\\n\\n    魏述忽然看到最后的监控视线中，出现了一个飞奔的黑点。\\n\\n    与此同时，他的头上同时也出现了一串黑线……那段监控图像放大之后，能够模糊看见，画面中一个约莫十七八岁的少年，一路飞奔，赶在轻轨关闭之前，登上了这辆本该驶走的末班列车。\\n\\n    这是哪个倒霉蛋？\\n\\n    “……”魏述望向南槿：“还能救吗？”\\n\\n    风衣女子沉默。\\n\\n    “13号线会经过一段很长的隧道。他至少会和A-009共处……20分钟。”南槿低头看了眼手表，面无表情地说了个冷笑话，“我赶到的时候，应该是热乎的。”\\n\\n    魏述神情复杂，他是阅读过档案的知情人，很清楚与A-009共处20分钟意味着什么。\\n\\n    还能热乎的话，已经不错了。\\n\\n    替这个少年送上默哀。\\n\\n    紧接着，他收敛神情，深吸一口气，将这些杂念抛在脑后，眼下最重要的是指挥接下来的收容工作，他选择了孤注一掷，已经没有退路，今夜必须顺利收容A-009，这样才能将损失降到最小……\\n\\n    “链接‘深海’，开放权限，我需要协助。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音回荡在控制室内。\\n\\n    说到深海两个字的时候，这位负责人眼神不由凝重起来，这次后方呈递的紧急报告认为，A-009脱狱的起因，是深海运转的失误。\\n\\n    魏述实在无法全部相信这份报告。\\n\\n    因为“深海”，这片覆盖串联整座东洲的巨大网络，已经紧密周全地运转了20余年，在过往的数百万起事件运算中，完美完成所有任务，从未出现一次错误……而这一次，他情愿相信是工作人员的误报，事实上每年总有误报，后来也总会被证实是人工失误。\\n\\n    大屏幕上黯淡下来，出现了层层海浪席卷冲刷的等待图，右下角的加载特效很复古，仔细去看，会发现那是一个模糊的，由马赛克拼凑而成的少女，在沙滩上踩着沙粒原地奔跑。\\n\\n    魏述叩着手指，很有耐心地等待。\\n\\n    最终满室生辉，一道清脆悦耳的温柔声音在控制室内响起。\\n\\n    “深海已链接……序号V349708069527，很高兴为您服务。”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    灯光昏暗。\\n\\n    列车颠簸。\\n\\n    这班轻轨，是一条撞向破碎夜幕尽头的长蛇。\\n\\n    而顾慎就在蛇的肚子里，他看到那位高大夫人的双眼了，与正常人截然不同，散发着红光的是两枚蛇一般的竖瞳，细长如剑。\\n\\n    夫人的声音，回荡在轻轨空荡荡的车厢中。\\n\\n    “是的……很显然，您触摸到了。”\\n\\n    而顾慎的回答，紧随其后，他额头有冷汗渗出，声音也在颤抖，但此刻的意识却前所未有的清醒。\\n\\n    一手触摸戒尺，一手攥拢锋刀。\\n\\n    高大礼服女人怔了怔，似乎有些失望。\\n\\n    她停顿了一刹，继续礼貌性地追问：“那么……为什么呢？”\\n\\n    顾慎在昏暗炽光中，紧紧盯住夫人膝前沾染血迹的旧报纸，他试图看清那张报纸上的内容，但光线太暗，无法看清。\\n\\n    顾慎轻声笑道：“夫人……恕我直言，不是每一件事物都能被完美的具象化体现，但当我们触碰更大的领域，我们拥有的，只会比想象中更多。3和4之间已经囊括了无限。”\\n\\n    高大礼服女人蛇形瞳孔中的红芒，隐约闪动了一下。\\n\\n    她动了动嘴唇，似乎笑了。\\n\\n    看到这抹笑，顾慎只觉得毛骨悚然，他保持着相对安全的距离，向前缓缓挪进，那股笼罩心头的压迫感至今没有散去。\\n\\n    他毫不怀疑，自己说错一句话，乃至一个字……都会触发这位礼服女人拔刀的条件。\\n\\n    于是他只能保持沉默，在沉默的宁静中，缓缓靠近女人。\\n\\n    那张报纸，是自己唯一能够了解对方的信息媒介，如果能够看到，或许会有帮助。\\n\\n    可是夫人口中只是轻轻吐出了两个字：“继续。”\\n\\n    “……π是一个无限不循环的常数，这意味着它拥有无止境的精度，而在有限精度的尺子上，没有任何一个点，可以标记出π。”\\n\\n    顾慎一边开口，试图稳住对方，同时缓缓蹲下身子，在逼仄空间中抬头，仰视高大女人，这句话似乎触怒了对方，女人唇角的笑意顷刻间消失，眼神也变得如蛇一般冰冷。\\n\\n    她握住了剔骨刀，整辆轻轨都翻涌冰冷入骨的寒风。\\n\\n    也正是在这一刻，顾慎看到了风中颤抖的报纸，还有猩红的血字……那是一连串的数字符号，还有证明公式。\\n\\n    有些眼熟的。\\n\\n    他在哪见过的。\\n\\n    大脑在疯狂运转。\\n\\n    顾慎回想着自己第一眼看到女人的场景，那时候她在看报纸……神情如痴如醉。\\n\\n    原来，原来如此。\\n\\n    “可即便如此，我依然坚信，在3和4之间，能够触摸π。”\\n\\n    顾慎抬头，声音有些沙哑。\\n\\n    “夫人……至于其中原因，你我都知道的，不是吗？”\\n\\n    “艾伦.图灵。”\\n\\n    在顾慎念出这个人名的时候，高大夫人的身躯显然一震。\\n\\n    她讶异地凝视顾慎。\\n\\n    是的，顾慎找到了“答案”……夫人让自己说下去，不是想听到证明过程，而是想寻求共同的志向。\\n\\n    那张报纸上密密麻麻的数学符号、证明公式，所指向的最终点，也正是高大夫人眼中怀揣狂热所膜拜顶礼的对象。\\n\\n    她想听到的，不过是这个人名而已。\\n\\n    艾伦.图灵。\\n\\n    那位赫赫有名，缔造深海网络的伟大人物，很少有人知道，他也是一位数学家，而在数学的领域中，π在3和4的集合之内，轻易便可触摸。\\n\\n    在物理的领域中，π反倒像是不存在的虚构数字，无法被触碰，更不可被刻度指代。\\n\\n    这个名字说出口后。\\n\\n    轻轨寒冷的风忽然熄灭了。\\n\\n    闪烁的灯光好像也随之熄灭了。\\n\\n    夫人的神情变得柔和起来，她伸出一只手，似乎是想扶起顾慎，但袖中滑出了一枚尺子，那是先前她比划的银色戒尺。\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔，下意识伸手接过尺子。\\n\\n    下一刻——\\n\\n    通过尺子连接的两人分开。\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道。\\n\\n    呜咽狂风灌顶而下，失重感陡然袭来，顾慎不受控制地抛飞，捏着尺子，重重摔在地上。\\n\\n    “咚！”\\n\\n    顾慎面色一变，听到了一声闷响，像是有什么重物狠狠摔在轻轨车厢之上，自己头顶之上，竟被踩出了一对肉眼可见的脚印——\\n\\n    千万蓬火光电弧迸溅。\\n\\n    伴随着刺耳尖锐的轰鸣，一柄长刀，斜着穿透车厢铁皮，无比精准地刺入高大礼服女人的肩头，像是一枚钉子，将高大女人死死钉在车厢一侧。\\n\\n    紧接着第二把刀插入车厢顶部，刀刃旋转，如同切纸，车厢顶部的一大块铁皮脱落，一个披着大风衣的红发女人踏着铁皮轰然降落。\\n\\n    南槿就落在顾慎正前方。\\n\\n    她眯起双眼，回首瞥了眼自己身后搂着衣服跌坐的少年，冷静无比地汇报。\\n\\n    “魏述……那个倒霉蛋还活着。”\\n\\n    倒霉蛋，这个称呼还不错，至少很恰当……顾慎龇牙咧嘴，搂着铁栏杆稳住身子，刚刚那一下太疼了，屁股像是摔成了八瓣。\\n\\n    现在浑身上下的感受，除了疼，就是眩晕。\\n\\n    他小心翼翼将尺子摄在怀中，藏在衣襟内侧，这枚戒尺触摸之时，出乎意料的清凉，让他变得格外清醒。\\n\\n    而被钉在车厢一侧的黑色礼服女人，此刻则是异常愤怒，她伸出一只手，攥向南槿钉在自己体内的长刀，想要将其拔出。\\n\\n    “嗤——”\\n\\n    在她五根手指触摸长刀的一刻，刀刃暴燃，炽亮银光照亮整节车厢！\\n\\n    夫人痛苦尖啸，不得不松开手掌。\\n\\n    那把银刃燃烧着炽烈光火，但光焰也在迅速黯淡——\\n\\n    显然时间有限。\\n\\n    但此时南槿没有动手，而是选择了等待。\\n\\n    她在等待魏述的指示。\\n\\n    电流沙沙。\\n\\n    “转移作战地点，先解救这个叫‘顾慎’的少年。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音响起，一字一句，不带感情：\\n\\n    “不要在列车上与A-009战斗，这是深海给出的最优解。”\\n\\n===第三章 恶战===\\n\\n深海给出的最优解，是先解救这个少年么？\\n\\n    其实听到这个回答，南槿并不觉得意外。\\n\\n    她很清楚，与A-009共处20分钟相安无事，意味着什么……这可是一个危险程度抵达A级的失控者。\\n\\n    能做到这一点，可不是普通的运气好就能解释。\\n\\n    资料上显示，A-009疯狂追寻着某个常人无法理解的真理。\\n\\n    顾慎能和她和平共处，不可能是意外……难道说，这个少年也是个疯子？\\n\\n    来不及多想。\\n\\n    魏述的声音再一次响起：“我将切断这节车厢，接下来你需要带着他脱离。”\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    轻轨在大藤市郊区的夜风中撒野疾驰，一道沉闷的断裂声音响起，这节车厢抛开了与身后其他车厢的连接挂钩，轮毂在剧烈摩擦声中抱紧，由于惯性缘故，整节车厢从底部开始“缓缓”腾空。\\n\\n    南槿面无表情：“抱紧我。”\\n\\n    顾慎：“？？？”\\n\\n    他猛地一个前扑，毫不客气抱住南槿的纤腰，宽大风衣下是一具温热纤细的躯干，顾慎摸到了好几道冰冷硌手的修长轮廓……这个女人腰间还悬挂着三把长短刀。\\n\\n    联想到先前切割列车的寒光，他情不自禁打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    一个颠簸！\\n\\n    列车车厢几乎腾空，两个人踩在车厢底部，以近乎垂直于地面的角度向下滑掠。\\n\\n    南槿速度极快地踏出碎步，完全不像是腰间缠着大汉，因为车厢倒飞掀起之故，此刻的她像是飞檐走壁的一只夜猫，整个世界都被逆转，唯独她保持平衡。\\n\\n    屏息敛神，双手持刀递斩十字。\\n\\n    炽亮的刀芒照破黑暗。\\n\\n    “铛铛铛”三声脆响！\\n\\n    剔骨刀格挡了刀锋！\\n\\n    但夫人喉咙中再一次响起痛苦的低吼，就连顾慎都能看到，那敞开的黑色大礼服中，飘出的那一连串鲜红血珠。\\n\\n    拔刀那一刻，南槿眼瞳中的所有色泽便全都褪去，化为一片冰冷。\\n\\n    她并不贪胜，虽然抵斩之后成功突破，一刀精准扎入高大女士的胸口，但得手便立即回身，千钧一发之际，南槿一只手闪电般掠出，五根手指紧紧攥住顾慎后衣领，在车厢彻底翻滚90度的时候猛地下蹲，重重一靴踩碎钢化玻璃，像是潜游的潜水者向下沉去。\\n\\n    破碎的玻璃，翻滚的电弧，像是深海里漂浮的海草。\\n\\n    而脱轨的车厢则像是一枚上升的潜艇，只是这里是陆地，而不是海洋。\\n\\n    车厢翻滚，从轨道上抛飞，如同落坡巨石，势不可挡地撞击地面，不断碰撞，滑掠出千万蓬绚烂弧光，倾翻前的最后一刻，夜幕中两道身影险而又险地跳出，落在一块草坪之上。\\n\\n    南槿拍了拍风衣灰尘，她目光视线始终紧紧盯着那远方滑出四五百米的破碎车厢，摔出轨道之后，那节车厢没有动静，一片死寂。\\n\\n    烟尘升腾，她没有掉以轻心，而是从腰间拔出第三把长刀，同时冷冷汇报：“目标已救出……A-009仍在车厢里。”\\n\\n    魏述很快给出回复：“封锁周边，后援很快就到，不要让它逃脱。”\\n\\n    南槿轻轻嗯了一声。\\n\\n    “咔嚓……”\\n\\n    视线捕捉到那节车厢在死寂之后，轻微动弹了一下……南槿立即反手握住第四把刀，将其拔出，双手持刀之后，安心了许多，但总觉得身上不太舒服。\\n\\n    南槿低头，发现了原因：“你还要抱到什么时候？”\\n\\n    “可以多抱会么？”某位少年很没有骨气地抱紧大腿，腆着脸皮蹭了蹭，挤出谄媚的笑：“大哥……我好怕啊。”\\n\\n    这副表情，真的是怕么？\\n\\n    明明自己切开车厢的时候，这家伙还和A-009谈笑风生。\\n\\n    “A-009的能力是腐化。”南槿面无表情：“通常情况下……她能够污染肢体接触的物事，包括但不仅限于刀，剑，金属，枪械……还有人。”\\n\\n    顾慎回想列车最后一幕，礼服女人微笑对着自己伸出手的画面，忍不住打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    腐化？\\n\\n    这也太吓人了……自己还接了那把尺子，不会有事吧？\\n\\n    “刚刚的交战，我可不确定，这衣服有没有与它有过接触。”\\n\\n    南槿轻描淡写的一句话，顾慎烫手一般撒开风衣。\\n\\n    “大哥接下来还有一场恶战啊，加油加油……”顾慎一边打气，一边小心翼翼\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Analyse: The

零零幺===\\n\\n23点44分。\\n\\n    空空荡荡的轻轨站，顾慎一边飞奔，一边低头瞥了眼手表。\\n\\n    还能赶得上末班车么……他有些担忧，但远方立即响起低鸣。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    幽暗漆黑隧道里，顷刻间撞出万千缕绚烂光弧，最后一班轻轨列车，缓缓降速，平稳停靠在顾慎面前。\\n\\n    看到列车，顾慎刚刚松了口气，紧接着又皱起眉头，屏住呼吸。\\n\\n    厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\\n\\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\\n\\n    零零幺。\\n\\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\\n\\n    “滴滴滴——”\\n\\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\\n\\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\\n\\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\\n\\n    “哦呼……”\\n\\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\\n\\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\\n\\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\\n\\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\\n\\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\\n\\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\\n\\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\\n\\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\\n\\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\\n\\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\\n\\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\\n\\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\\n\\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\\n\\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\\n\\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\\n\\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\\n\\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\\n\\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\\n\\n    “呜——”\\n\\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\\n\\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\\n\\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\\n\\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\\n\\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\\n\\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\\n\\n    是在与自己说话么？\\n\\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\\n\\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\\n\\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    这算是什么问题？\\n\\n    答案当然是存在。\\n\\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\\n\\n    原因也很简单。\\n\\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\\n\\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\\n\\n    顾慎回头。\\n\\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\\n\\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\\n\\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\\n\\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔。\\n\\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\\n\\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\\n\\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\\n\\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\\n\\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\\n\\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\\n\\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\\n\\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\\n\\n    “噗嗤。”\\n\\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\\n\\n    没有想象中的触碰。\\n\\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\\n\\n    “顾慎……”\\n\\n    “……活下去。”\\n\\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\\n\\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\\n\\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\\n\\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\\n\\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\\n\\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\\n\\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\\n\\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\\n\\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\\n\\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\\n\\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\\n\\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\\n\\n    23点59分。\\n\\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\\n\\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\\n\\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\\n\\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\\n\\n    活下去。\\n\\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\\n\\n    就在目光掠去之时。\\n\\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\\n\\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\\n\\n    “这位先生。”\\n\\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\\n\\n    “您……请讲。”\\n\\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\\n\\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\\n\\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\\n\\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\\n\\n    “就在刚刚。”\\n\\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\\n\\n===第二章 答案===\\n\\n“闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    “重复一遍，闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    警报响起的这一夜，大藤市的有些人注定不能安眠。\\n\\n    魏述盯着紧急会议室里闪烁的数十片屏幕，神情紧绷，手中紧攥的那份紧急报告被捏出层层叠叠的褶皱。\\n\\n    他额头青筋鼓起，双拳重重抵在控制台前，无法理解：“闸门怎么会被突破？监狱里那么多的看守者，A-009是怎么逃脱的？”\\n\\n    “大藤市接手A-009才三天，就出现了逃狱事件，紧急报告上说闸门破碎是‘深海’的网络问题……可是‘深海’怎么会出问题？”\\n\\n    魏述转头望向身后：“不论如何，现在它已经逃了。南槿女士，你是负责押送A-009的专员，应该很清楚……这东西逃逸之后的危险吧？我们要尽快将它再次收容关押！”\\n\\n    会议室门口，一位红色长发女子，穿着黑色宽大风衣，此刻双手搭在脑后，正在盘绕长发。\\n\\n    她没有回应魏述，而是平静凝视着那一片片闪烁的屏幕。\\n\\n    数十位工作人员各自负责一片屏幕，每片屏幕都被切割成数十块，从闸门到收容城的所有监控全都被调取出来，但是没人发现异常……闸门破碎的警报传出之后，A-009仿佛就人间蒸发了一般，这片监控网能够捕捉到一只蚊子飞过的痕迹，却无法捕捉到A-009的一根头发。\\n\\n    南槿缓缓盘着长发。\\n\\n    她的目光变得漆黑，无神，与此同时数十片屏幕，数百幕监控发散的光源，在她眼中骤然变得缓慢。\\n\\n    并不是A-009真的消失了。\\n\\n    它并不具备瞬间移动这样的能力，只是速度太快了，快到……这些寻常的工作人员，如果不放慢倍速，根本无法捕捉到移动轨迹。\\n\\n    注意到南槿眼中光线的变化，魏述神情凝重抬起手，做了个手势，示意手下操作人员安静，不要打扰南槿的观察。\\n\\n    整座会议室鸦雀无声。\\n\\n    最终南槿锁定了一片屏幕，在放慢了接近二十倍的视野中，A-009的影子出现，像是一片群鸦笼罩的阴翳，即便目光沾染，便会觉得心头压抑。\\n\\n    女子目光缓慢顺延，从一片屏幕挪移到另外一片屏幕，同时在脑海地图中，刻画出一条蜿蜒曲折的逃脱轨迹。\\n\\n    凝视过程中，那双无神的瞳孔缓缓流出两行清泪。\\n\\n    “它最后出现在……轻轨13号线，列车最后一段路程很长，它无法下车。”风衣女子看了眼时间，轻声地说：“如果抄近道，能够赶在隧道出口拦住它。”\\n\\n    魏述早已亲自等候在控制台前，听到13号线的那一刻，立即亲手调取了沿途几条主干道的监控，放慢了倍速，果然看到了那鬼魅如幽灵一般的影子……那道影子撞破闸门，逃脱之后，一路向着大藤市的郊区方向逃窜。\\n\\n    “你想拦住它，一个人？”魏述皱眉，“抓捕A级逃犯不是小事，我建议你直接求助树先生。”\\n\\n    “来不及了。老师很忙……如果你能保证后援，那么这件事我能搞定。”南槿望向魏述，冷冷地问道：“更何况，你等得了吗？错失这次机会，下次锁定……可就不知道是什么时候了。”\\n\\n    这个女人很敏锐。\\n\\n    魏述神情阴沉，对方说得没错……这是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。\\n\\n    而且看样子，A-009是铁了心想逃离大藤，今夜之后，想要追捕，无异于大海捞针。\\n\\n    “那就……行动！你只要能够拦住A-009，我会保障足够的后援！”\\n\\n    魏述下定决心，同时心底有些释然，幸好是13号线……这个时间段，这种驶向偏远郊区的轻轨，不会有人乘坐。\\n\\n    “等等……那是什么？”\\n\\n    “放大。”\\n\\n    “再放大。”\\n\\n    魏述忽然看到最后的监控视线中，出现了一个飞奔的黑点。\\n\\n    与此同时，他的头上同时也出现了一串黑线……那段监控图像放大之后，能够模糊看见，画面中一个约莫十七八岁的少年，一路飞奔，赶在轻轨关闭之前，登上了这辆本该驶走的末班列车。\\n\\n    这是哪个倒霉蛋？\\n\\n    “……”魏述望向南槿：“还能救吗？”\\n\\n    风衣女子沉默。\\n\\n    “13号线会经过一段很长的隧道。他至少会和A-009共处……20分钟。”南槿低头看了眼手表，面无表情地说了个冷笑话，“我赶到的时候，应该是热乎的。”\\n\\n    魏述神情复杂，他是阅读过档案的知情人，很清楚与A-009共处20分钟意味着什么。\\n\\n    还能热乎的话，已经不错了。\\n\\n    替这个少年送上默哀。\\n\\n    紧接着，他收敛神情，深吸一口气，将这些杂念抛在脑后，眼下最重要的是指挥接下来的收容工作，他选择了孤注一掷，已经没有退路，今夜必须顺利收容A-009，这样才能将损失降到最小……\\n\\n    “链接‘深海’，开放权限，我需要协助。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音回荡在控制室内。\\n\\n    说到深海两个字的时候，这位负责人眼神不由凝重起来，这次后方呈递的紧急报告认为，A-009脱狱的起因，是深海运转的失误。\\n\\n    魏述实在无法全部相信这份报告。\\n\\n    因为“深海”，这片覆盖串联整座东洲的巨大网络，已经紧密周全地运转了20余年，在过往的数百万起事件运算中，完美完成所有任务，从未出现一次错误……而这一次，他情愿相信是工作人员的误报，事实上每年总有误报，后来也总会被证实是人工失误。\\n\\n    大屏幕上黯淡下来，出现了层层海浪席卷冲刷的等待图，右下角的加载特效很复古，仔细去看，会发现那是一个模糊的，由马赛克拼凑而成的少女，在沙滩上踩着沙粒原地奔跑。\\n\\n    魏述叩着手指，很有耐心地等待。\\n\\n    最终满室生辉，一道清脆悦耳的温柔声音在控制室内响起。\\n\\n    “深海已链接……序号V349708069527，很高兴为您服务。”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    灯光昏暗。\\n\\n    列车颠簸。\\n\\n    这班轻轨，是一条撞向破碎夜幕尽头的长蛇。\\n\\n    而顾慎就在蛇的肚子里，他看到那位高大夫人的双眼了，与正常人截然不同，散发着红光的是两枚蛇一般的竖瞳，细长如剑。\\n\\n    夫人的声音，回荡在轻轨空荡荡的车厢中。\\n\\n    “是的……很显然，您触摸到了。”\\n\\n    而顾慎的回答，紧随其后，他额头有冷汗渗出，声音也在颤抖，但此刻的意识却前所未有的清醒。\\n\\n    一手触摸戒尺，一手攥拢锋刀。\\n\\n    高大礼服女人怔了怔，似乎有些失望。\\n\\n    她停顿了一刹，继续礼貌性地追问：“那么……为什么呢？”\\n\\n    顾慎在昏暗炽光中，紧紧盯住夫人膝前沾染血迹的旧报纸，他试图看清那张报纸上的内容，但光线太暗，无法看清。\\n\\n    顾慎轻声笑道：“夫人……恕我直言，不是每一件事物都能被完美的具象化体现，但当我们触碰更大的领域，我们拥有的，只会比想象中更多。3和4之间已经囊括了无限。”\\n\\n    高大礼服女人蛇形瞳孔中的红芒，隐约闪动了一下。\\n\\n    她动了动嘴唇，似乎笑了。\\n\\n    看到这抹笑，顾慎只觉得毛骨悚然，他保持着相对安全的距离，向前缓缓挪进，那股笼罩心头的压迫感至今没有散去。\\n\\n    他毫不怀疑，自己说错一句话，乃至一个字……都会触发这位礼服女人拔刀的条件。\\n\\n    于是他只能保持沉默，在沉默的宁静中，缓缓靠近女人。\\n\\n    那张报纸，是自己唯一能够了解对方的信息媒介，如果能够看到，或许会有帮助。\\n\\n    可是夫人口中只是轻轻吐出了两个字：“继续。”\\n\\n    “……π是一个无限不循环的常数，这意味着它拥有无止境的精度，而在有限精度的尺子上，没有任何一个点，可以标记出π。”\\n\\n    顾慎一边开口，试图稳住对方，同时缓缓蹲下身子，在逼仄空间中抬头，仰视高大女人，这句话似乎触怒了对方，女人唇角的笑意顷刻间消失，眼神也变得如蛇一般冰冷。\\n\\n    她握住了剔骨刀，整辆轻轨都翻涌冰冷入骨的寒风。\\n\\n    也正是在这一刻，顾慎看到了风中颤抖的报纸，还有猩红的血字……那是一连串的数字符号，还有证明公式。\\n\\n    有些眼熟的。\\n\\n    他在哪见过的。\\n\\n    大脑在疯狂运转。\\n\\n    顾慎回想着自己第一眼看到女人的场景，那时候她在看报纸……神情如痴如醉。\\n\\n    原来，原来如此。\\n\\n    “可即便如此，我依然坚信，在3和4之间，能够触摸π。”\\n\\n    顾慎抬头，声音有些沙哑。\\n\\n    “夫人……至于其中原因，你我都知道的，不是吗？”\\n\\n    “艾伦.图灵。”\\n\\n    在顾慎念出这个人名的时候，高大夫人的身躯显然一震。\\n\\n    她讶异地凝视顾慎。\\n\\n    是的，顾慎找到了“答案”……夫人让自己说下去，不是想听到证明过程，而是想寻求共同的志向。\\n\\n    那张报纸上密密麻麻的数学符号、证明公式，所指向的最终点，也正是高大夫人眼中怀揣狂热所膜拜顶礼的对象。\\n\\n    她想听到的，不过是这个人名而已。\\n\\n    艾伦.图灵。\\n\\n    那位赫赫有名，缔造深海网络的伟大人物，很少有人知道，他也是一位数学家，而在数学的领域中，π在3和4的集合之内，轻易便可触摸。\\n\\n    在物理的领域中，π反倒像是不存在的虚构数字，无法被触碰，更不可被刻度指代。\\n\\n    这个名字说出口后。\\n\\n    轻轨寒冷的风忽然熄灭了。\\n\\n    闪烁的灯光好像也随之熄灭了。\\n\\n    夫人的神情变得柔和起来，她伸出一只手，似乎是想扶起顾慎，但袖中滑出了一枚尺子，那是先前她比划的银色戒尺。\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔，下意识伸手接过尺子。\\n\\n    下一刻——\\n\\n    通过尺子连接的两人分开。\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道。\\n\\n    呜咽狂风灌顶而下，失重感陡然袭来，顾慎不受控制地抛飞，捏着尺子，重重摔在地上。\\n\\n    “咚！”\\n\\n    顾慎面色一变，听到了一声闷响，像是有什么重物狠狠摔在轻轨车厢之上，自己头顶之上，竟被踩出了一对肉眼可见的脚印——\\n\\n    千万蓬火光电弧迸溅。\\n\\n    伴随着刺耳尖锐的轰鸣，一柄长刀，斜着穿透车厢铁皮，无比精准地刺入高大礼服女人的肩头，像是一枚钉子，将高大女人死死钉在车厢一侧。\\n\\n    紧接着第二把刀插入车厢顶部，刀刃旋转，如同切纸，车厢顶部的一大块铁皮脱落，一个披着大风衣的红发女人踏着铁皮轰然降落。\\n\\n    南槿就落在顾慎正前方。\\n\\n    她眯起双眼，回首瞥了眼自己身后搂着衣服跌坐的少年，冷静无比地汇报。\\n\\n    “魏述……那个倒霉蛋还活着。”\\n\\n    倒霉蛋，这个称呼还不错，至少很恰当……顾慎龇牙咧嘴，搂着铁栏杆稳住身子，刚刚那一下太疼了，屁股像是摔成了八瓣。\\n\\n    现在浑身上下的感受，除了疼，就是眩晕。\\n\\n    他小心翼翼将尺子摄在怀中，藏在衣襟内侧，这枚戒尺触摸之时，出乎意料的清凉，让他变得格外清醒。\\n\\n    而被钉在车厢一侧的黑色礼服女人，此刻则是异常愤怒，她伸出一只手，攥向南槿钉在自己体内的长刀，想要将其拔出。\\n\\n    “嗤——”\\n\\n    在她五根手指触摸长刀的一刻，刀刃暴燃，炽亮银光照亮整节车厢！\\n\\n    夫人痛苦尖啸，不得不松开手掌。\\n\\n    那把银刃燃烧着炽烈光火，但光焰也在迅速黯淡——\\n\\n    显然时间有限。\\n\\n    但此时南槿没有动手，而是选择了等待。\\n\\n    她在等待魏述的指示。\\n\\n    电流沙沙。\\n\\n    “转移作战地点，先解救这个叫‘顾慎’的少年。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音响起，一字一句，不带感情：\\n\\n    “不要在列车上与A-009战斗，这是深海给出的最优解。”\\n\\n===第三章 恶战===\\n\\n深海给出的最优解，是先解救这个少年么？\\n\\n    其实听到这个回答，南槿并不觉得意外。\\n\\n    她很清楚，与A-009共处20分钟相安无事，意味着什么……这可是一个危险程度抵达A级的失控者。\\n\\n    能做到这一点，可不是普通的运气好就能解释。\\n\\n    资料上显示，A-009疯狂追寻着某个常人无法理解的真理。\\n\\n    顾慎能和她和平共处，不可能是意外……难道说，这个少年也是个疯子？\\n\\n    来不及多想。\\n\\n    魏述的声音再一次响起：“我将切断这节车厢，接下来你需要带着他脱离。”\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    轻轨在大藤市郊区的夜风中撒野疾驰，一道沉闷的断裂声音响起，这节车厢抛开了与身后其他车厢的连接挂钩，轮毂在剧烈摩擦声中抱紧，由于惯性缘故，整节车厢从底部开始“缓缓”腾空。\\n\\n    南槿面无表情：“抱紧我。”\\n\\n    顾慎：“？？？”\\n\\n    他猛地一个前扑，毫不客气抱住南槿的纤腰，宽大风衣下是一具温热纤细的躯干，顾慎摸到了好几道冰冷硌手的修长轮廓……这个女人腰间还悬挂着三把长短刀。\\n\\n    联想到先前切割列车的寒光，他情不自禁打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    一个颠簸！\\n\\n    列车车厢几乎腾空，两个人踩在车厢底部，以近乎垂直于地面的角度向下滑掠。\\n\\n    南槿速度极快地踏出碎步，完全不像是腰间缠着大汉，因为车厢倒飞掀起之故，此刻的她像是飞檐走壁的一只夜猫，整个世界都被逆转，唯独她保持平衡。\\n\\n    屏息敛神，双手持刀递斩十字。\\n\\n    炽亮的刀芒照破黑暗。\\n\\n    “铛铛铛”三声脆响！\\n\\n    剔骨刀格挡了刀锋！\\n\\n    但夫人喉咙中再一次响起痛苦的低吼，就连顾慎都能看到，那敞开的黑色大礼服中，飘出的那一连串鲜红血珠。\\n\\n    拔刀那一刻，南槿眼瞳中的所有色泽便全都褪去，化为一片冰冷。\\n\\n    她并不贪胜，虽然抵斩之后成功突破，一刀精准扎入高大女士的胸口，但得手便立即回身，千钧一发之际，南槿一只手闪电般掠出，五根手指紧紧攥住顾慎后衣领，在车厢彻底翻滚90度的时候猛地下蹲，重重一靴踩碎钢化玻璃，像是潜游的潜水者向下沉去。\\n\\n    破碎的玻璃，翻滚的电弧，像是深海里漂浮的海草。\\n\\n    而脱轨的车厢则像是一枚上升的潜艇，只是这里是陆地，而不是海洋。\\n\\n    车厢翻滚，从轨道上抛飞，如同落坡巨石，势不可挡地撞击地面，不断碰撞，滑掠出千万蓬绚烂弧光，倾翻前的最后一刻，夜幕中两道身影险而又险地跳出，落在一块草坪之上。\\n\\n    南槿拍了拍风衣灰尘，她目光视线始终紧紧盯着那远方滑出四五百米的破碎车厢，摔出轨道之后，那节车厢没有动静，一片死寂。\\n\\n    烟尘升腾，她没有掉以轻心，而是从腰间拔出第三把长刀，同时冷冷汇报：“目标已救出……A-009仍在车厢里。”\\n\\n    魏述很快给出回复：“封锁周边，后援很快就到，不要让它逃脱。”\\n\\n    南槿轻轻嗯了一声。\\n\\n    “咔嚓……”\\n\\n    视线捕捉到那节车厢在死寂之后，轻微动弹了一下……南槿立即反手握住第四把刀，将其拔出，双手持刀之后，安心了许多，但总觉得身上不太舒服。\\n\\n    南槿低头，发现了原因：“你还要抱到什么时候？”\\n\\n    “可以多抱会么？”某位少年很没有骨气地抱紧大腿，腆着脸皮蹭了蹭，挤出谄媚的笑：“大哥……我好怕啊。”\\n\\n    这副表情，真的是怕么？\\n\\n    明明自己切开车厢的时候，这家伙还和A-009谈笑风生。\\n\\n    “A-009的能力是腐化。”南槿面无表情：“通常情况下……她能够污染肢体接触的物事，包括但不仅限于刀，剑，金属，枪械……还有人。”\\n\\n    顾慎回想列车最后一幕，礼服女人微笑对着自己伸出手的画面，忍不住打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    腐化？\\n\\n    这也太吓人了……自己还接了那把尺子，不会有事吧？\\n\\n    “刚刚的交战，我可不确定，这衣服有没有与它有过接触。”\\n\\n    南槿轻描淡写的一句话，顾慎烫手一般撒开风衣。\\n\\n    “大哥接下来还有一场恶战啊，加油加油……”顾慎一边打气，一边小心翼翼\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Analyse: The

零零幺===\\n\\n23点44分。\\n\\n    空空荡荡的轻轨站，顾慎一边飞奔，一边低头瞥了眼手表。\\n\\n    还能赶得上末班车么……他有些担忧，但远方立即响起低鸣。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    幽暗漆黑隧道里，顷刻间撞出万千缕绚烂光弧，最后一班轻轨列车，缓缓降速，平稳停靠在顾慎面前。\\n\\n    看到列车，顾慎刚刚松了口气，紧接着又皱起眉头，屏住呼吸。\\n\\n    厢门打开，一股铁锈气味扑面而来。\\n\\n    他向后退了两步，打量这辆列车，车厢老旧，外表斑驳生锈，窗口旁用白漆拓写了三个工整的数字：\\n\\n    零零幺。\\n\\n    “没记错的话，大藤市……不是早就淘汰了这种列车么？”\\n\\n    “滴滴滴——”\\n\\n    来不及多想了，擦着车厢厢门关闭的最后时刻，顾慎猫腰弹射，有惊无险挤进车厢。\\n\\n    握住扶手，松了口气。\\n\\n    余光不经意间一瞥。\\n\\n    “哦呼……”\\n\\n    顾慎心跳慢了一拍。\\n\\n    平日里这班轻轨发往偏远郊区，末班车往往没有其他人乘坐，只有自己一人，可是今天……\\n\\n    车厢里还有一个女孩。\\n\\n    顾慎觉得自己心都快化了，这个女孩就坐在自己对面，相隔不到三十公分，杏眼桃腮，长发散落，穿着一件单薄到近乎透明的纯白蕾丝长裙，裸露出粉皙的肩头，大片如雪的肌肤。\\n\\n    那件单薄的裙子很白。\\n\\n    但少女更白，白得有些晃眼。\\n\\n    少女没有穿鞋，轻盈地踮着脚尖踩在车厢地面上……膝盖上躺着一本摊开一半的厚重书籍，安安静静阅读着厚书。\\n\\n    这个女孩太过完美，身上有着一种难以言明的独特气质，不像是现实世界中真实存在的人。看着她，顾慎感觉自己看到了一束光。\\n\\n    安静，柔和，圣洁，空灵。\\n\\n    翻页间隙，少女抬起头。\\n\\n    两人目光相对，顾慎连忙挪开目光，搓着手哈着气，匆忙遮掩自己的失态。\\n\\n    他怀疑自己是在做梦。\\n\\n    这世界上怎么会有这么好看的姑娘？\\n\\n    还有……她穿得这么少，难道不觉得冷么？\\n\\n    真想把自己的外套借给她穿啊。\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    【第二个人……上车了。】\\n\\n    女孩抬头，眼中闪过诧异，而后合上了书籍，认真打量起这个登车少年。\\n\\n    虽然这个少年现在缩在列车角落，搓手哈气，自顾自傻笑，并不知道“上车”这件事这意味着什么。\\n\\n    但她很清楚，这不可能是巧合。\\n\\n    “呜——”\\n\\n    轻轨徐徐发动，电弧迸溅来回冲刷隧道壁面。\\n\\n    这辆列车虽然老旧，但行驶地异常平稳。\\n\\n    窗外电弧弹射的声音，穿透玻璃之后，只剩下喑哑如雨水冲刷的窸窣碎响。\\n\\n    两个人谁也没有说话，就这么保持着安静，如果没有人开口，这班轻轨会穿过幽长隧道，寂静无声地行驶约莫二十分钟，抵达终点站。\\n\\n    但这份平静没有保持太久，很快就被少女的清脆声音打破。\\n\\n    “一个很重要的问题：3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    顾慎以为自己是幻听了。\\n\\n    是在与自己说话么？\\n\\n    他讶异地转头，环顾一圈，看到空空如也的车厢内部，对上了少女认真凝视自己的目光，顾慎伸手指了指自己，少女认真点了点头。\\n\\n    他尴尬笑了笑，对方竟真是在与自己对话。\\n\\n    “3和4之间……存在真实的π吗？”\\n\\n    这算是什么问题？\\n\\n    答案当然是存在。\\n\\n    可是此时，顾慎犹豫了一下，没有直接回答。\\n\\n    原因也很简单。\\n\\n    因为那个女孩直视自己的清澈瞳孔里，倒映着无比认真的波光，这道眼神让顾慎相信……这个看似简单的问题，没有那么简单。\\n\\n    女孩伸出一只手，指向顾慎身后。\\n\\n    顾慎回头。\\n\\n    这辆老旧车厢的内部竟然不知何时，被人刻下了斑驳的壁画……隐约可见那是一把老旧的刻度尺，刻度漫长，不知尽头蔓延到何处，但此刻能够清晰看见的，是上面加粗标记的3和4两个数字。\\n\\n    “如果触摸这把尺子……”\\n\\n    少女伸出一只手，隔空触摸尺子，她的声音变得轻了起来，像是一阵风，席卷车厢，有淡淡的哀伤。\\n\\n    “你能否触摸到π？”\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔。\\n\\n    他忽然明白了这个问题的真正含义，一个无限不循环的数字，一个只存在于理论中的数字。\\n\\n    这个数字的精度是无限的。\\n\\n    而尺子上的精度是有限的。\\n\\n    这把尺子即便放大亿万倍，也永远也不会有一个点，属于精度无限的“π”。\\n\\n    “顾慎……你的答案是什么？”\\n\\n    顾慎有些惘然，她知道自己的名字？\\n\\n    少女伸出的那只手，缓缓摊开，掌心有银色的十字纹路流淌，散发辉光。\\n\\n    看到十字辉光的那一刻，顾慎觉得熟悉而又温暖，像是回到了某场旧梦，他情不自禁做出了同样的动作，少年伸出手，想要与少女五指相扣。\\n\\n    “噗嗤。”\\n\\n    看到这个动作，女孩莞尔一笑。\\n\\n    没有想象中的触碰。\\n\\n    纯白纱裙的少女收手向后退去，一点一点，退到了顾慎视线所及的尽头，少女笑容一点一点消失，最后只剩下凝重和严肃。\\n\\n    “顾慎……”\\n\\n    “……活下去。”\\n\\n    车厢里的风忽而散了。\\n\\n    “轰隆隆隆！”\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道——\\n\\n    笼罩在顾慎头顶的光源瞬间破碎。\\n\\n    如果说这世上真的有白日梦，那么顾慎刚刚所经历的，就是人生十八年来最美妙的一场白日梦，虽然这场白日梦发生在晚上。\\n\\n    但轻轨驶出隧道，美梦破碎。\\n\\n    他陡然觉察到……一切都变了，斑驳的列车在驶出隧道的那一刻，仿佛被无形的力量洗涤冲刷。\\n\\n    轻轨开始震颤，一整节车厢都陷入剧烈震荡中，像是一截弯曲的钢铁蛇身，颠簸起伏，窗外迸溅的电弧在此刻尽数熄灭。\\n\\n    轮毂与铁轨撞击，刺骨入耳的摩擦声绞碎这场美梦。\\n\\n    顾慎毛骨悚然看着眼前的景象。\\n\\n    整节车厢的光线黯淡下来，依旧空空荡荡。\\n\\n    但先前那少女的座位，却被一位身材高大的黑色礼服女人所取代了。\\n\\n    她戴着宽大到足以遮蔽整张面容的礼帽，双手捧着一沓泛黄老旧的报纸，在支离破碎的灯光中阅读，即便是坐着，也几乎与顾慎个头平齐。\\n\\n    如果站起来……恐怕有两米多吧？\\n\\n    23点59分。\\n\\n    低头瞥了眼时间，顾慎面色有些苍白。\\n\\n    自己可能是遭遇某种常规认知无法解释的特异事件了……这节车厢虽然灯光昏暗，但依稀可见，座椅扶手都是崭新的，自己先前随处可见的斑驳，铁锈，全都消失不见。\\n\\n    自己其实是在这样的一间列车中，待了15分钟么？\\n\\n    那个少女所说的每一句话，都烙入脑海中，尤其是最后三个字。\\n\\n    活下去。\\n\\n    顾慎有些头皮发麻，他小心翼翼打量着那位沉浸在阅读报纸中的高大女士，心中感受到了强烈的危险。\\n\\n    就在目光掠去之时。\\n\\n    仿佛是“心有灵犀”一般——\\n\\n    那位给人极大压迫感的黑色礼服女子，缓缓抬起了头，顾慎看到黑暗帽檐下，散发出两道幽暗深邃的真实红芒。\\n\\n    “这位先生。”\\n\\n    黑色礼服女人叠起报纸，抬起头来，很有礼貌地低声发问：“我有一个很重要的问题……想要请教。”\\n\\n    “您……请讲。”\\n\\n    顾慎捏紧十指，深吸一口气，竭力让自己保持平静。\\n\\n    自己的回复似乎不重要。\\n\\n    因为这位夫人，在说完自己的话后，便自顾自取出了一把剔骨刀，搁置在膝前报纸上缓慢擦拭，报纸上多了斑斑血迹。\\n\\n    然后……她敞开礼服，礼服内襟悬吊着一把银色的戒尺，两根涂抹红色甲油的雪白手指，在尺间3和4的刻度之处，来回摩挲着。\\n\\n    “就在刚刚。”\\n\\n    正襟危坐的高大女人另一只手攥拢剔骨刀，侧着头颅，困惑地问：“我是否……触摸到了π？”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    （新书发布，每天两更分别在20点和22点~）\\n\\n===第二章 答案===\\n\\n“闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    “重复一遍，闸门破碎，A-009逃脱。”\\n\\n    警报响起的这一夜，大藤市的有些人注定不能安眠。\\n\\n    魏述盯着紧急会议室里闪烁的数十片屏幕，神情紧绷，手中紧攥的那份紧急报告被捏出层层叠叠的褶皱。\\n\\n    他额头青筋鼓起，双拳重重抵在控制台前，无法理解：“闸门怎么会被突破？监狱里那么多的看守者，A-009是怎么逃脱的？”\\n\\n    “大藤市接手A-009才三天，就出现了逃狱事件，紧急报告上说闸门破碎是‘深海’的网络问题……可是‘深海’怎么会出问题？”\\n\\n    魏述转头望向身后：“不论如何，现在它已经逃了。南槿女士，你是负责押送A-009的专员，应该很清楚……这东西逃逸之后的危险吧？我们要尽快将它再次收容关押！”\\n\\n    会议室门口，一位红色长发女子，穿着黑色宽大风衣，此刻双手搭在脑后，正在盘绕长发。\\n\\n    她没有回应魏述，而是平静凝视着那一片片闪烁的屏幕。\\n\\n    数十位工作人员各自负责一片屏幕，每片屏幕都被切割成数十块，从闸门到收容城的所有监控全都被调取出来，但是没人发现异常……闸门破碎的警报传出之后，A-009仿佛就人间蒸发了一般，这片监控网能够捕捉到一只蚊子飞过的痕迹，却无法捕捉到A-009的一根头发。\\n\\n    南槿缓缓盘着长发。\\n\\n    她的目光变得漆黑，无神，与此同时数十片屏幕，数百幕监控发散的光源，在她眼中骤然变得缓慢。\\n\\n    并不是A-009真的消失了。\\n\\n    它并不具备瞬间移动这样的能力，只是速度太快了，快到……这些寻常的工作人员，如果不放慢倍速，根本无法捕捉到移动轨迹。\\n\\n    注意到南槿眼中光线的变化，魏述神情凝重抬起手，做了个手势，示意手下操作人员安静，不要打扰南槿的观察。\\n\\n    整座会议室鸦雀无声。\\n\\n    最终南槿锁定了一片屏幕，在放慢了接近二十倍的视野中，A-009的影子出现，像是一片群鸦笼罩的阴翳，即便目光沾染，便会觉得心头压抑。\\n\\n    女子目光缓慢顺延，从一片屏幕挪移到另外一片屏幕，同时在脑海地图中，刻画出一条蜿蜒曲折的逃脱轨迹。\\n\\n    凝视过程中，那双无神的瞳孔缓缓流出两行清泪。\\n\\n    “它最后出现在……轻轨13号线，列车最后一段路程很长，它无法下车。”风衣女子看了眼时间，轻声地说：“如果抄近道，能够赶在隧道出口拦住它。”\\n\\n    魏述早已亲自等候在控制台前，听到13号线的那一刻，立即亲手调取了沿途几条主干道的监控，放慢了倍速，果然看到了那鬼魅如幽灵一般的影子……那道影子撞破闸门，逃脱之后，一路向着大藤市的郊区方向逃窜。\\n\\n    “你想拦住它，一个人？”魏述皱眉，“抓捕A级逃犯不是小事，我建议你直接求助树先生。”\\n\\n    “来不及了。老师很忙……如果你能保证后援，那么这件事我能搞定。”南槿望向魏述，冷冷地问道：“更何况，你等得了吗？错失这次机会，下次锁定……可就不知道是什么时候了。”\\n\\n    这个女人很敏锐。\\n\\n    魏述神情阴沉，对方说得没错……这是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。\\n\\n    而且看样子，A-009是铁了心想逃离大藤，今夜之后，想要追捕，无异于大海捞针。\\n\\n    “那就……行动！你只要能够拦住A-009，我会保障足够的后援！”\\n\\n    魏述下定决心，同时心底有些释然，幸好是13号线……这个时间段，这种驶向偏远郊区的轻轨，不会有人乘坐。\\n\\n    “等等……那是什么？”\\n\\n    “放大。”\\n\\n    “再放大。”\\n\\n    魏述忽然看到最后的监控视线中，出现了一个飞奔的黑点。\\n\\n    与此同时，他的头上同时也出现了一串黑线……那段监控图像放大之后，能够模糊看见，画面中一个约莫十七八岁的少年，一路飞奔，赶在轻轨关闭之前，登上了这辆本该驶走的末班列车。\\n\\n    这是哪个倒霉蛋？\\n\\n    “……”魏述望向南槿：“还能救吗？”\\n\\n    风衣女子沉默。\\n\\n    “13号线会经过一段很长的隧道。他至少会和A-009共处……20分钟。”南槿低头看了眼手表，面无表情地说了个冷笑话，“我赶到的时候，应该是热乎的。”\\n\\n    魏述神情复杂，他是阅读过档案的知情人，很清楚与A-009共处20分钟意味着什么。\\n\\n    还能热乎的话，已经不错了。\\n\\n    替这个少年送上默哀。\\n\\n    紧接着，他收敛神情，深吸一口气，将这些杂念抛在脑后，眼下最重要的是指挥接下来的收容工作，他选择了孤注一掷，已经没有退路，今夜必须顺利收容A-009，这样才能将损失降到最小……\\n\\n    “链接‘深海’，开放权限，我需要协助。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音回荡在控制室内。\\n\\n    说到深海两个字的时候，这位负责人眼神不由凝重起来，这次后方呈递的紧急报告认为，A-009脱狱的起因，是深海运转的失误。\\n\\n    魏述实在无法全部相信这份报告。\\n\\n    因为“深海”，这片覆盖串联整座东洲的巨大网络，已经紧密周全地运转了20余年，在过往的数百万起事件运算中，完美完成所有任务，从未出现一次错误……而这一次，他情愿相信是工作人员的误报，事实上每年总有误报，后来也总会被证实是人工失误。\\n\\n    大屏幕上黯淡下来，出现了层层海浪席卷冲刷的等待图，右下角的加载特效很复古，仔细去看，会发现那是一个模糊的，由马赛克拼凑而成的少女，在沙滩上踩着沙粒原地奔跑。\\n\\n    魏述叩着手指，很有耐心地等待。\\n\\n    最终满室生辉，一道清脆悦耳的温柔声音在控制室内响起。\\n\\n    “深海已链接……序号V349708069527，很高兴为您服务。”\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    ……\\n\\n    灯光昏暗。\\n\\n    列车颠簸。\\n\\n    这班轻轨，是一条撞向破碎夜幕尽头的长蛇。\\n\\n    而顾慎就在蛇的肚子里，他看到那位高大夫人的双眼了，与正常人截然不同，散发着红光的是两枚蛇一般的竖瞳，细长如剑。\\n\\n    夫人的声音，回荡在轻轨空荡荡的车厢中。\\n\\n    “是的……很显然，您触摸到了。”\\n\\n    而顾慎的回答，紧随其后，他额头有冷汗渗出，声音也在颤抖，但此刻的意识却前所未有的清醒。\\n\\n    一手触摸戒尺，一手攥拢锋刀。\\n\\n    高大礼服女人怔了怔，似乎有些失望。\\n\\n    她停顿了一刹，继续礼貌性地追问：“那么……为什么呢？”\\n\\n    顾慎在昏暗炽光中，紧紧盯住夫人膝前沾染血迹的旧报纸，他试图看清那张报纸上的内容，但光线太暗，无法看清。\\n\\n    顾慎轻声笑道：“夫人……恕我直言，不是每一件事物都能被完美的具象化体现，但当我们触碰更大的领域，我们拥有的，只会比想象中更多。3和4之间已经囊括了无限。”\\n\\n    高大礼服女人蛇形瞳孔中的红芒，隐约闪动了一下。\\n\\n    她动了动嘴唇，似乎笑了。\\n\\n    看到这抹笑，顾慎只觉得毛骨悚然，他保持着相对安全的距离，向前缓缓挪进，那股笼罩心头的压迫感至今没有散去。\\n\\n    他毫不怀疑，自己说错一句话，乃至一个字……都会触发这位礼服女人拔刀的条件。\\n\\n    于是他只能保持沉默，在沉默的宁静中，缓缓靠近女人。\\n\\n    那张报纸，是自己唯一能够了解对方的信息媒介，如果能够看到，或许会有帮助。\\n\\n    可是夫人口中只是轻轻吐出了两个字：“继续。”\\n\\n    “……π是一个无限不循环的常数，这意味着它拥有无止境的精度，而在有限精度的尺子上，没有任何一个点，可以标记出π。”\\n\\n    顾慎一边开口，试图稳住对方，同时缓缓蹲下身子，在逼仄空间中抬头，仰视高大女人，这句话似乎触怒了对方，女人唇角的笑意顷刻间消失，眼神也变得如蛇一般冰冷。\\n\\n    她握住了剔骨刀，整辆轻轨都翻涌冰冷入骨的寒风。\\n\\n    也正是在这一刻，顾慎看到了风中颤抖的报纸，还有猩红的血字……那是一连串的数字符号，还有证明公式。\\n\\n    有些眼熟的。\\n\\n    他在哪见过的。\\n\\n    大脑在疯狂运转。\\n\\n    顾慎回想着自己第一眼看到女人的场景，那时候她在看报纸……神情如痴如醉。\\n\\n    原来，原来如此。\\n\\n    “可即便如此，我依然坚信，在3和4之间，能够触摸π。”\\n\\n    顾慎抬头，声音有些沙哑。\\n\\n    “夫人……至于其中原因，你我都知道的，不是吗？”\\n\\n    “艾伦.图灵。”\\n\\n    在顾慎念出这个人名的时候，高大夫人的身躯显然一震。\\n\\n    她讶异地凝视顾慎。\\n\\n    是的，顾慎找到了“答案”……夫人让自己说下去，不是想听到证明过程，而是想寻求共同的志向。\\n\\n    那张报纸上密密麻麻的数学符号、证明公式，所指向的最终点，也正是高大夫人眼中怀揣狂热所膜拜顶礼的对象。\\n\\n    她想听到的，不过是这个人名而已。\\n\\n    艾伦.图灵。\\n\\n    那位赫赫有名，缔造深海网络的伟大人物，很少有人知道，他也是一位数学家，而在数学的领域中，π在3和4的集合之内，轻易便可触摸。\\n\\n    在物理的领域中，π反倒像是不存在的虚构数字，无法被触碰，更不可被刻度指代。\\n\\n    这个名字说出口后。\\n\\n    轻轨寒冷的风忽然熄灭了。\\n\\n    闪烁的灯光好像也随之熄灭了。\\n\\n    夫人的神情变得柔和起来，她伸出一只手，似乎是想扶起顾慎，但袖中滑出了一枚尺子，那是先前她比划的银色戒尺。\\n\\n    顾慎怔了怔，下意识伸手接过尺子。\\n\\n    下一刻——\\n\\n    通过尺子连接的两人分开。\\n\\n    轻轨驶出隧道。\\n\\n    呜咽狂风灌顶而下，失重感陡然袭来，顾慎不受控制地抛飞，捏着尺子，重重摔在地上。\\n\\n    “咚！”\\n\\n    顾慎面色一变，听到了一声闷响，像是有什么重物狠狠摔在轻轨车厢之上，自己头顶之上，竟被踩出了一对肉眼可见的脚印——\\n\\n    千万蓬火光电弧迸溅。\\n\\n    伴随着刺耳尖锐的轰鸣，一柄长刀，斜着穿透车厢铁皮，无比精准地刺入高大礼服女人的肩头，像是一枚钉子，将高大女人死死钉在车厢一侧。\\n\\n    紧接着第二把刀插入车厢顶部，刀刃旋转，如同切纸，车厢顶部的一大块铁皮脱落，一个披着大风衣的红发女人踏着铁皮轰然降落。\\n\\n    南槿就落在顾慎正前方。\\n\\n    她眯起双眼，回首瞥了眼自己身后搂着衣服跌坐的少年，冷静无比地汇报。\\n\\n    “魏述……那个倒霉蛋还活着。”\\n\\n    倒霉蛋，这个称呼还不错，至少很恰当……顾慎龇牙咧嘴，搂着铁栏杆稳住身子，刚刚那一下太疼了，屁股像是摔成了八瓣。\\n\\n    现在浑身上下的感受，除了疼，就是眩晕。\\n\\n    他小心翼翼将尺子摄在怀中，藏在衣襟内侧，这枚戒尺触摸之时，出乎意料的清凉，让他变得格外清醒。\\n\\n    而被钉在车厢一侧的黑色礼服女人，此刻则是异常愤怒，她伸出一只手，攥向南槿钉在自己体内的长刀，想要将其拔出。\\n\\n    “嗤——”\\n\\n    在她五根手指触摸长刀的一刻，刀刃暴燃，炽亮银光照亮整节车厢！\\n\\n    夫人痛苦尖啸，不得不松开手掌。\\n\\n    那把银刃燃烧着炽烈光火，但光焰也在迅速黯淡——\\n\\n    显然时间有限。\\n\\n    但此时南槿没有动手，而是选择了等待。\\n\\n    她在等待魏述的指示。\\n\\n    电流沙沙。\\n\\n    “转移作战地点，先解救这个叫‘顾慎’的少年。”\\n\\n    魏述的声音响起，一字一句，不带感情：\\n\\n    “不要在列车上与A-009战斗，这是深海给出的最优解。”\\n\\n===第三章 恶战===\\n\\n深海给出的最优解，是先解救这个少年么？\\n\\n    其实听到这个回答，南槿并不觉得意外。\\n\\n    她很清楚，与A-009共处20分钟相安无事，意味着什么……这可是一个危险程度抵达A级的失控者。\\n\\n    能做到这一点，可不是普通的运气好就能解释。\\n\\n    资料上显示，A-009疯狂追寻着某个常人无法理解的真理。\\n\\n    顾慎能和她和平共处，不可能是意外……难道说，这个少年也是个疯子？\\n\\n    来不及多想。\\n\\n    魏述的声音再一次响起：“我将切断这节车厢，接下来你需要带着他脱离。”\\n\\n    “轰隆隆——”\\n\\n    轻轨在大藤市郊区的夜风中撒野疾驰，一道沉闷的断裂声音响起，这节车厢抛开了与身后其他车厢的连接挂钩，轮毂在剧烈摩擦声中抱紧，由于惯性缘故，整节车厢从底部开始“缓缓”腾空。\\n\\n    南槿面无表情：“抱紧我。”\\n\\n    顾慎：“？？？”\\n\\n    他猛地一个前扑，毫不客气抱住南槿的纤腰，宽大风衣下是一具温热纤细的躯干，顾慎摸到了好几道冰冷硌手的修长轮廓……这个女人腰间还悬挂着三把长短刀。\\n\\n    联想到先前切割列车的寒光，他情不自禁打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    一个颠簸！\\n\\n    列车车厢几乎腾空，两个人踩在车厢底部，以近乎垂直于地面的角度向下滑掠。\\n\\n    南槿速度极快地踏出碎步，完全不像是腰间缠着大汉，因为车厢倒飞掀起之故，此刻的她像是飞檐走壁的一只夜猫，整个世界都被逆转，唯独她保持平衡。\\n\\n    屏息敛神，双手持刀递斩十字。\\n\\n    炽亮的刀芒照破黑暗。\\n\\n    “铛铛铛”三声脆响！\\n\\n    剔骨刀格挡了刀锋！\\n\\n    但夫人喉咙中再一次响起痛苦的低吼，就连顾慎都能看到，那敞开的黑色大礼服中，飘出的那一连串鲜红血珠。\\n\\n    拔刀那一刻，南槿眼瞳中的所有色泽便全都褪去，化为一片冰冷。\\n\\n    她并不贪胜，虽然抵斩之后成功突破，一刀精准扎入高大女士的胸口，但得手便立即回身，千钧一发之际，南槿一只手闪电般掠出，五根手指紧紧攥住顾慎后衣领，在车厢彻底翻滚90度的时候猛地下蹲，重重一靴踩碎钢化玻璃，像是潜游的潜水者向下沉去。\\n\\n    破碎的玻璃，翻滚的电弧，像是深海里漂浮的海草。\\n\\n    而脱轨的车厢则像是一枚上升的潜艇，只是这里是陆地，而不是海洋。\\n\\n    车厢翻滚，从轨道上抛飞，如同落坡巨石，势不可挡地撞击地面，不断碰撞，滑掠出千万蓬绚烂弧光，倾翻前的最后一刻，夜幕中两道身影险而又险地跳出，落在一块草坪之上。\\n\\n    南槿拍了拍风衣灰尘，她目光视线始终紧紧盯着那远方滑出四五百米的破碎车厢，摔出轨道之后，那节车厢没有动静，一片死寂。\\n\\n    烟尘升腾，她没有掉以轻心，而是从腰间拔出第三把长刀，同时冷冷汇报：“目标已救出……A-009仍在车厢里。”\\n\\n    魏述很快给出回复：“封锁周边，后援很快就到，不要让它逃脱。”\\n\\n    南槿轻轻嗯了一声。\\n\\n    “咔嚓……”\\n\\n    视线捕捉到那节车厢在死寂之后，轻微动弹了一下……南槿立即反手握住第四把刀，将其拔出，双手持刀之后，安心了许多，但总觉得身上不太舒服。\\n\\n    南槿低头，发现了原因：“你还要抱到什么时候？”\\n\\n    “可以多抱会么？”某位少年很没有骨气地抱紧大腿，腆着脸皮蹭了蹭，挤出谄媚的笑：“大哥……我好怕啊。”\\n\\n    这副表情，真的是怕么？\\n\\n    明明自己切开车厢的时候，这家伙还和A-009谈笑风生。\\n\\n    “A-009的能力是腐化。”南槿面无表情：“通常情况下……她能够污染肢体接触的物事，包括但不仅限于刀，剑，金属，枪械……还有人。”\\n\\n    顾慎回想列车最后一幕，礼服女人微笑对着自己伸出手的画面，忍不住打了个寒颤。\\n\\n    腐化？\\n\\n    这也太吓人了……自己还接了那把尺子，不会有事吧？\\n\\n    “刚刚的交战，我可不确定，这衣服有没有与它有过接触。”\\n\\n    南槿轻描淡写的一句话，顾慎烫手一般撒开风衣。\\n\\n    “大哥接下来还有一场恶战啊，加油加油……”顾慎一边打气，一边小心翼翼\\n\"}], \"index\": \"55\", \"category1\":

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is flawed. The agent repeatedly encounters errors related to non-numeric values in the dataset and attempts to encode or remove columns without fully addressing the underlying issues. This results in multiple failed attempts before finally training a model, but it still fails when making predictions due to mismatched feature dimensions.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is more robust. The agent correctly identifies and preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a regression model, evaluates its performance using various metrics (MSE, MAE, R-squared), and provides an analysis of these metrics.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code quality suffers from repeated errors that are not adequately resolved. The final prediction step also fails because of incorrect input dimensions for features.\n\nAgent2's code quality is higher as it successfully loads the data, preprocesses it appropriately by selecting relevant features without causing errors during encoding or removal steps. It then trains a model and evaluates its performance with appropriate metrics.\n\nOverall Decision:\nAgent2’s solution is better because it completes all tasks correctly without encountering persistent errors like Agent1 did.

This approach avoids unnecessary iterations and quickly leads to a correct solution without encountering intermediate errors.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code initially fails due to incorrect column names ('country' instead of 'Country', 'year' instead of actual year columns). After identifying these mistakes through inspection, Agent1 successfully filters the data and plots the required line chart using `plt.savefig`.\n\nAgent2’s code efficiently loads, inspects, filters, and plots the data in fewer steps. It directly finds China’s row index after inspecting the DataFrame structure once. However, Agent2 uses `plt.show()` instead of saving the plot as instructed (`plt.savefig`), which could be considered non-compliant with specific instructions provided.\n\nFinal Decision:\nWhile both agents eventually produce correct outputs (line charts for China's tea exports), Agent1 adheres strictly to all given instructions including saving plots using `plt.savefig`.

Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial\\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\\n\\n1. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is\\nimportant to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the\\nprompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. 3\\n\\n\\fFigure 3: Safety human evaluation results for L\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000 \\u0000-C\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000 compared to other open-source and closed-\\nsource models.

To complement the human evaluation, we\\nused a more capable model, not subject to\\nour own guidance. We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\\n\\n1. We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-speciﬁc data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\\n\\n1. Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. 3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) . The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Like all LLMs,\\nL\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000 \\u0000 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\\nSolaiman et al., 2023).

Human raters compared model generations on ~4k\\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details of\\nour responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3. While reviewing\\nthese results, it is important to note that human evaluations\\ncan be noisy due to limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity\\nof the review guidelines, subjectivity of individual raters,\\nand the inherent di\\u0000culty of comparing generations. The orders in\\nwhich the model responses are presented to\\nGPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce ﬁne-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs. 4.4 Safety Evaluation of L\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000 \\u0000-C\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000 .

We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce ﬁne-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Ho\\u0000mann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. This step can require signiﬁcant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is flawed. The agent repeatedly attempts to use shell commands with the exclamation mark (!) which are not supported in this environment, leading to multiple syntax errors. Eventually, Agent1 switches from `pydub` to `moviepy`, but still encounters issues before finally succeeding.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is better as it correctly identifies the steps needed and uses the `pydub` library without attempting unsupported shell commands. This leads to a successful execution on the first attempt.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code initially fails due to repeated misuse of shell commands and missing dependencies (`ffprobe`). After several failed attempts, Agent1 eventually succeeds using an alternative approach with `moviepy`.\n\nAgent2’s code successfully cuts and saves the first 30 seconds of the audio file using only one attempt with correct usage of `pydub`.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n- **Agent 1**'s reasoning quality is straightforward and correctly identifies the steps needed to increase the brightness of an image using OpenCV. The code reads the image, increases its brightness by adding a constant value to each pixel, and saves the result.\n- **Agent 2** also provides correct reasoning but includes an additional step of converting the color space from BGR to RGB before increasing brightness. This conversion is unnecessary for simply adjusting brightness.\n\nCode Quality:\n- **Agent 1**'s code directly adds a constant value to each pixel's intensity in all three channels (BGR), which effectively increases the overall brightness. The approach is simple and effective.\n- **Agent 2** uses `cv2.convertScaleAbs` with parameters `alpha=1.5` and `beta=0`, which scales up all pixel values by a factor of 1.5 without shifting them (`beta`). While this method works, it introduces complexity that isn't necessary for just increasing brightness.\n\nBoth solutions pass as they achieve the desired outcome without errors.\n\nFinal Decision:\nGiven that both agents successfully increased the image's brightness, Agent 1's solution is more direct and simpler while achieving the same goal as Agent 2’s more complex approach.", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 1, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is poor. The agent correctly identified the task but repeatedly made the same mistake by using `cv` instead of `cv2`, resulting in a NameError each time. This indicates a lack of proper debugging and understanding of the error.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also poor. The agent attempted to display images using OpenCV functions that are not supported in their execution environment, leading to repeated errors related to displaying images with `cvShowImage`. Despite identifying the issue, they did not adapt their approach effectively.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code quality is low because it contains repetitive mistakes (using `cv` instead of `cv2`) which prevent successful execution and completion of the task.\n\nAgent2's code quality is also low due to repeated attempts at displaying images using unsupported methods (`cvShowImage`). They failed to adjust their approach despite multiple errors indicating an environmental limitation.\n\nFinal Decision:\nBoth agents failed to produce working solutions, but Agent1 showed slightly better initial steps towards blending images before getting stuck on a typo issue. However, since both agents ultimately failed without making significant progress or corrections after encountering issues, neither solution can be considered superior overall.", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Failed", "Agent2": "Failed"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 0, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

By predicting the next word in continuous text, LLMs undergo\\nself-supervised pre-training on massive datasets, enabling them to achieve various purposes and\\npossess many abilities, such as novel creation, text summarization, code completion, and more.\\nSubsequent developments like supervised ﬁne-tuning and reward modeling have enabled Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to better follow user intentions and instructions. This has endowed\\nthem with more versatile conversational capabilities and rapidly expanded their inﬂuence.\\nThis wave is sparked with closed products , such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), Claude (An-\\nthropic, 2023), and Bard (Google, 2023), which are developed with extensive computational\\nresources and substantial annotation costs. These products have signiﬁcantly raised the commu-\\nnity’s expectations for the capabilities of open-source LLMs, consequently inspiring a series of\\nwork (Bai et al., 2023; Du et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Yang et al., 2023).\\nAmong these, the LLaMA series models (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) stand out. It consolidates a\\nrange of works to create an efﬁcient and stable architecture, building well-performing models\\nranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Consequently, the LLaMA series has become the de facto\\nbenchmark for architecture and performance among open-source models.\\nFollowing LLaMA, the open-source community has primarily focused on training ﬁxed-size\\n(7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B), high-quality models, often neglecting research exploration into LLM\\nscaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020). Nonetheless, research on scaling laws is\\nof utmost importance, considering that the current open-source models are merely at the initial\\nstage of Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) development. In addition, early works (Hoffmann\\net al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) reached varying conclusions on the scaling of model and data\\nwith increased compute budgets and inadequately addressed hyperparameter discussions. In\\nthis paper, we extensively investigate the scaling behavior of language models and apply our\\nﬁndings in two widely used large-scale model conﬁgurations, namely 7B and 67B. Our study\\naims to lay the groundwork for future scaling of open-source LLMs, paving the way for further\\nadvancements in this domain. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst examined the scaling laws of batch size\\nand learning rate, and found their trends with model size. Building on this, we conducted a\\ncomprehensive study of the scaling laws of the data and model scale, successfully revealing the\\noptimal model/data scaling-up allocation strategy and predicting the expected performance\\nof our large-scale models. Additionally, during development, we discovered that the scaling\\nlaws derived from different datasets show signiﬁcant differences. This suggests that choice\\nof dataset remarkably affects the scaling behavior, indicating that caution should be exercised\\nwhen generalizing scaling laws across datasets.\\nUnder the guidance of our scaling laws, we build from scratch open-source large language\\nmodels, and release as much information as possible for community reference. We collect\\n2 trillion tokens for pre-training, primarily in Chinese and English. At the model level, we\\ngenerally followed the architecture of LLaMA, but replaced the cosine learning rate scheduler\\nwith a multi-step learning rate scheduler, maintaining performance while facilitating continual\\ntraining. We collected over 1 million instances for supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT) (Ouyang et al.,\\n2022) from diverse sources. This paper shares our experiences with different SFT strategies\\nand ﬁndings in data ablation techniques. Additionally, we have utilized direct preference\\noptimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) to improve the conversational performance of the\\nmodel.\\n3We conduct extensive evaluations using our base and chat models. The evaluation results\\ndemonstrate that DeepSeek LLM surpasses LLaMA-2 70B across various benchmarks, particu-\\nlarly in the ﬁelds of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Following SFT and DPO, the DeepSeek\\n67B chat model outperforms GPT-3.5 in both Chinese and English open-ended evaluations. This\\nhighlights the superior performance of DeepSeek 67B in generating high-quality responses and\\nengaging in meaningful conversations in both languages. Furthermore, the safety evaluation\\nindicates that DeepSeek 67B Chat can provide harmless responses in practice.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we ﬁrst introduce our pre-training basic concepts of DeepSeek\\nLLM in Section 2, including the composition of data, model architecture, infrastructure, and\\nhyperparameters. In Section 3, we provide a detailed explanation of the scaling laws we have\\ndiscovered and its implications. Additionally, we discuss the rationale behind our selection of\\npre-training hyperparameters, taking into account the insights gained from the scaling laws\\nanalysis. In Section 4, we discuss our ﬁne-tuning methodology, encompassing the composition\\nof ﬁne-tuning data and speciﬁc methods during the SFT and DPO stages. We then present\\nthe detailed evaluation results of DeepSeek LLM in Section 5, covering both the base and chat\\nmodels, as well as their performance in open-ended evaluations and safety evaluations. Finally,\\nwe discuss the current limitations and future directions of DeepSeek LLM in Section 6.\\n2.Pre-Training\\n2.1.Data\\nOur main objective is to comprehensively enhance the richness and diversity of the dataset.\\nWe have gained valuable insights from reputable sources such as (Computer, 2023; Gao et al.,\\n2020; Penedo et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a). To achieve these goals, we have organized our\\napproach into three essential stages: deduplication, ﬁltering, and remixing. The deduplication\\nand remixing stages ensure a diverse representation of the data by sampling unique instances.\\nThe ﬁltering stage enhances the density of information, thereby enabling more efﬁcient and\\neffective model training.\\nWe adopted an aggressive deduplication strategy, expanding the deduplication scope. Our\\nanalysis revealed that deduplicating the entire Common Crawl corpus results in higher removal\\nof duplicate instances compared to deduplicating within a single dump. Table 1 illustrates\\nthat deduplicating across 91 dumps eliminates four times more documents than a single dump\\nmethod.\\nDumps Used 1 2 6 12 16 22 41 91\\nDeduplication Rate (%) 22.2 46.7 55.7 69.9 75.7 76.3 81.6 89.8\\nTable 1 |Deduplication ratios for various Common Crawl dumps.\\nIn the ﬁltering stage, we focus on developing robust criteria for document quality assess-\\nment. This involves a detailed analysis incorporating both linguistic and semantic evaluations,\\nproviding a view of data quality from individual and global perspectives. In the remixing phase,\\nwe adjust our approach to address data imbalances, focusing on increasing the presence of\\nunderrepresented domains. This adjustment aims to achieve a more balanced and inclusive\\ndataset, ensuring that diverse perspectives and information are adequately represented.\\nFor our tokenizer, we implemented the Byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BBPE) algorithm\\nbased on the tokenizers library (Huggingface Team, 2019).

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent 1's reasoning quality is straightforward and directly addresses the user's request to remove null values from the dataset. The code provided reads the CSV file, drops rows with null values, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file.\n\nAgent 2's reasoning quality includes an additional step of checking for null values before attempting to remove them. This extra step ensures that there are indeed no null values in the dataset before proceeding to save it as a new file. However, this approach might be seen as redundant since if there were no nulls, saving without modification would suffice.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent 1's code correctly fulfills the user query by removing any rows with null values and saving the result into a new CSV file named `accessories_organizer_no_null.csv`. The process is efficient and meets all requirements specified by the user.\n\nAgent 2's code first checks for null values and then proceeds to save the data into a new CSV file named `accessories_organizer_cleaned.csv` even though no modifications were necessary because there were no nulls present initially. While this does ensure accuracy, it adds unnecessary steps given that we know beforehand what needs to be done (removing potential nulls).\n\nFinal Decision:\nBoth agents' solutions pass execution without errors; however, Agent 1’s solution is more direct and efficient in addressing exactly what was asked by removing potential redundancy.", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 1, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is flawed. The agent repeatedly attempts to encode categorical variables without properly identifying and handling all the necessary columns, leading to continuous errors. This indicates a lack of thorough analysis and understanding of the dataset.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality also has issues but shows some consistency in attempting to resolve the KeyError for 'Blemishes'. However, it falls into an infinite loop trying to handle this error without making progress.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code does not fulfill the user query as it continuously fails due to unhandled categorical variables. The repeated errors indicate poor preprocessing steps and inadequate debugging strategies.\n\nAgent2's code similarly fails due to persistent KeyErrors related to 'Blemishes', indicating that despite recognizing column presence, there was no effective resolution strategy implemented.\n\nFinal Decision:\nBoth agents failed in their tasks; however, Agent2 demonstrated a slightly better approach by consistently checking for column presence even though it did not lead to successful execution.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n- Agent1's reasoning quality is initially focused on using Mask R-CNN for background removal, but it encounters issues with loading the pre-trained model. The agent then switches to using the GrabCut algorithm and successfully removes the background.\n- Agent2's reasoning quality involves attempting image inpainting for background removal, which is not a typical method for this task. The agent faces multiple errors related to file paths and missing imports before finally resolving them.\n\nCode Quality:\n- Agent1's code quality shows an understanding of both advanced (Mask R-CNN) and simpler (GrabCut) methods for background removal. Despite initial setbacks, the final solution effectively removes the background.\n- Agent2’s code has several errors that needed debugging steps involving path verification and module importation. Additionally, image inpainting is less effective compared to segmentation techniques like GrabCut or Mask R-CNN.\n\nFinal Decision:\nAgent1’s solution demonstrates better adaptability by switching methods when encountering issues with Mask R-CNN and ultimately providing a working solution using GrabCut.", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Failed"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 1, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is good. The agent correctly identifies the steps needed to plot sine and cosine functions, generates x values from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\), calculates corresponding y values for both functions, plots them using matplotlib, and saves the plot image in the specified output folder. The explanation about periodicity is also accurate.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also good but repetitive. The agent sets a wider range for x-axis values (from \\(-\\pi\\) to \\(\\pi\\)), which still effectively demonstrates the periodic nature of sine and cosine functions. However, Agent2 repeatedly submits identical code snippets without any new analysis or adjustments after each submission.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code quality is high as it fulfills all user requirements by generating correct plots and saving them in the specified directory. It uses `plt.savefig()` appropriately instead of `plt.show()`, ensuring compliance with instructions.\n\nAgent2’s code quality is technically correct but less efficient due to repeated submissions of identical code snippets without additional insights or improvements after each step.

The final output includes a basic HTML template with sections for company introduction, products/services, and contact information.\n- **Agent 2**'s code fails consistently due to repeated AttributeError issues when trying to parse non-existent tags from extracted text using BeautifulSoup.\n\nFinal Decision:\nGiven that Agent 1's solution successfully produces an HTML file while Agent 2's solution does not execute correctly even after multiple attempts:", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Failed"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 1, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

The agent repeatedly failed to define the `logo_img` variable correctly and did not handle errors effectively, leading to multiple unsuccessful attempts without resolving the issue.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also poor. The agent encountered issues with reading the image file and did not successfully generate a QR code with an embedded logo despite multiple attempts. However, Agent2 made more varied debugging efforts compared to Agent1.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code quality is low as it contains repeated mistakes such as undefined variables (`logo_img`) and indentation errors that were never resolved.\n\nAgent2's code quality is slightly better but still flawed due to persistent issues in reading the image file and generating the QR code properly. Despite this, Agent2 showed some effort in debugging by checking if files exist and importing necessary modules like `os`.\n\nFinal Decision:", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Failed", "Agent2": "Failed"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 0, "Agent2": 1}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is good. The agent correctly identifies the steps needed to read the data, filter it for Australian gold medals, and plot a line chart using matplotlib. The code provided reads the CSV file, filters for rows where 'Country' is 'Australia', sorts by year, and plots the number of gold medals over time. This solution passes without any errors.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also good but slightly less efficient than Agent1’s approach. Agent2 first inspects the data structure before proceeding with filtering and plotting. While this step can be useful in some contexts, it adds an extra step that wasn't strictly necessary given that both agents had access to similar information about the dataset structure from previous user inputs.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code quality is high; it fulfills all requirements efficiently:\n- Reads data from CSV.\n- Filters relevant rows.\n- Sorts by year.\n- Plots a line chart with appropriate labels and title.\n- Saves the plot image correctly.\n\nAgent2's code quality has minor issues:\n- It does not sort by year explicitly which might lead to incorrect plotting if data isn't already sorted.\n- Uses `australian_gold.index` instead of extracting years directly which could cause misalignment in x-axis values if indices are not sequential or start at zero after filtering.\n\nBoth solutions pass without any errors (Pass).\n\nFinal Decision:", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 1, "Agent2": 0}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.

{"Analysis": "Reasoning: \n\nAgent1's reasoning quality is good. The agent correctly identifies the steps needed to analyze the distribution of citations and count countries for each region. However, there is a redundancy in code execution as it repeats loading data and analysis without any new insights.\n\nAgent2's reasoning quality is also good. The agent follows a clear plan to load the dataset, plot the distribution of citations, identify outliers using IQR method, and count countries by region. Additionally, Agent2 provides visual representation which adds value to understanding citation distribution.\n\nCode Quality:\n\nAgent1's code correctly loads data from Excel file, calculates descriptive statistics for citations, identifies outliers based on interquartile range (IQR), and counts unique countries per region. However, it lacks visualization which could have added more clarity.\n\nAgent2’s code not only performs all necessary calculations but also includes a histogram plot that visually represents citation distribution. This enhances understanding significantly compared to just statistical output alone.\n\nFinal Decision:", "Decision": {"Pass": {"Agent1": "Pass", "Agent2": "Pass"}, "Decision": {"Agent1": 0, "Agent2": 1}}, "Reference": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI Agent who is proficient in solve complicated task. \\nEach step you should wirte executable code to fulfill user query.
