Nirmala Sitharaman to equal Morarji Desai’s record with her sixth straight budget,"With the presentation of the interim budget on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha, who had presented five budgets in a row.","Sitharaman, the first full-time woman finance minister of the country, has presented five full budgets since July 2019 and will present an interim or vote-on-account budget next week.
With the presentation of the interim budget on February 1, Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha, who had presented five budgets in a row.
Desai, as finance minister, had presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959-1964. The interim budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.

As the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman’s interim budget may not contain any major policy changes. Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any “spectacular announcement” in the interim budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.
A vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on a pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.
The new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final budget for 2024-25 sometime in July. Usually, interim budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.
After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19. It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.

Piyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019. Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.
After the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented a budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71.
That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a ‘bahi-khata’ with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.

Under Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.
India is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and USD 30 trillion by 2047. Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 budgets — the maximum by any finance minister — had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.
The first budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.
Sitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.
Rakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.

In the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebates and standard deduction concessions. “While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,” Nangia said.

"‘Will densify network, want to be at least no. 2 in any city pair’: Air India Express MD","'In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international,' says AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh","The merger of Tata group’s budget airlines Air India Express (AI Express) and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) into one carrier — AI Express — is on track for completion in the next three to four months, even as operational integration of the two is nearly complete. According to AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh, the airline in its brand-new avatar aspires to double its market share by 2028, more than triple its fleet size to 180 aircraft, and build a dense network focussed on tier-two and tier-three cities, all while working in synergy with parent Air India to realise the group’s vision of emerging as a formidable player in India and beyond.
In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Singh gives a lowdown of AI Express’s vision and strategy to chart ambitious growth in the coming years. Edited Excerpts:
How is the integration of AI Express and AIX Connect coming along?
The past year has been all about the integration, which involves integrating systems, processes, platforms, people, brand, networks and fleets. We have tweaked the combined network to facilitate flows between the two networks. That integration is now moving into a merger, which we hope to complete in three to four months. Simultaneously, a massive growth agenda has kicked in. We are now inducting aircraft at a rate of three-and-a-half per month, and it will continue for a while.
ADVERTISEMENT
With steady supply of new aircraft, what shape will your network take?
The new capacity will help us grow significantly. This growth will come from our existing markets as well as some new ones. In our existing markets, we will densify the network and plug gaps that we could not address earlier due to capacity constraints. The broad network strategy is that we will first consolidate our presence and become stronger wherever we already operate. We want to be at least the number two player in any city pair. We don’t want to open too many new stations together. We want to open one station, deploy capacity there to increase connectivity, and spread out from there. As we become firm in a market, it will also help us in rationalising costs.
AI Express was almost exclusively a short-haul international carrier while AIX Connect was a domestic airline. Should we expect the combined entity to be more focussed on the domestic market?
If you put the two networks together, we roughly have 50 per cent capacity each on domestic and international. This will remain so for the next year or two. The domestic portion will then grow to some extent. We will probably end up with about 60 per cent domestic and 40 per cent international. The domestic market is much bigger and our capacity deployment will reflect that.
In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international.
What is the status of network optimisation at the group level between the full-service carrier (Air India) and the budget carrier (AI Express)?
It has started and will be a continuous process as the nature of markets is dynamic. Route rationalisation at the group level has begun. Different operational models suit different markets. If we see that a market is better served in financial terms by the low-cost model, then we will deploy the relevant product. There will be markets where operating premium products will offer an upside, so the full-service product will be offered there. In markets and segments that are big and deep enough, we would look at straddling both product offerings.
ADVERTISEMENT
 The market sees IndiGo, which has a domestic market share of over 60 per cent, as your biggest competitor. How do you look at that challenge?
The market is big enough and deep enough, and has space for a number of players. The broad thrust of our network strategy will be a lot more focus on tier-two and tier-three cities. We will also focus on international operations from tier-two cities, because that is a space we understand very well. We will not be concentrating our capacity on large cities. Of course, there will be some capacity deployed there, but a large part will be for tier-two, tier-three cities.
So, you are looking at a point-to-point network instead of hub-and-spoke?
Yes, it will not be focussed on a large hub. However, our network will have a number a focus cities, probably 10, where we will also transfer passengers. Like, Kochi may not be a hub per se, but it has significant potential for domestic-to-domestic, international-to-domestic, and even international-to-international transfers. Similarly, we are connecting Bangalore, where we have a dense network, to our points in Kerala. For example, we can offer travel from Ayodhya to Kochi via Bangalore, or a Lucknow-Bangalore-Trivandrum connection.
Air India Express operated Boeing 737s while AIX Connect had Airbus A320s. Do you now plan to operate both or retire the A320s?
We will have a mixed fleet. You have to look at the fleet from the group perspective. The fleet will be fungible. We want that flexibility. Having a mixed fleet may have some sub-optimality, but with scale, fleet commonality benefits diminish. If you have 200 or 300 or 400 aircraft, due to the large scale of operations, a mixed fleet is not too different from a single-type fleet.
ADVERTISEMENT
Our plan is to have a fleet size of about 180 aircraft by 2028. We have a legacy fleet of 26 737NGs (737 Next Generation), of which 10 are leased, and 28 A320s, all of which are leased. The leased aircraft will start going back to lessors starting this year.
The Air India group’s 470-aircraft order includes 190 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Are all of those going to come to Air India Express?
So far, we have not taken that call at the group level. The aircraft deliveries will stretch over years. Some of the Airbus A320s and A321s (also part of the order) may even come our (Air India Express) way. Aircraft type within the group will remain fungible given the long delivery schedule and the decisions will be based on synergies within the group like aircraft engineering and maintenance. But certainly, Air India Express will operate under an all-economy model.
Considering Air India Express has mostly been a short-haul international carrier and given the growth trajectory you are eyeing, are you looking to get into wide-body operations as well?
No, we have no such plans at present. We first want to grow and scale up with our current model (low-cost domestic and short-haul international operations), before thinking about anything else.
By when can we see your legacy fleet in the new Air India Express branding?
We are not going to change the livery on the legacy fleet. One reason is that many of those aircraft will be going back to lessors once the leases expire. Secondly, we want to prioritise the new aircraft, as the painting capacity in the MROs (maintenance, repair, and overhaul units) is limited. We want to paint the new aircraft first and then take a call on the older ones. In any airline’s livery change programme, it takes years for 100 per cent of the aircraft to get rebranded.
Given your thrust on tier-two and tier-three cities, will we see Air India Express applying for routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik)?
Certainly, we could look at it, if it fits into our route strategy. We would be really interested in international UDAN, but there could be some domestic routes also that could make sense for us.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/interview-with-aloke-singh-md-air-india-express-9128164/,business

Apart from these 68 planes—part of the Air India group’s mammoth 470-aircraft order placed in 2023—four leased Boeing 777 wide-body planes will also join the carrier’s fleet.
Air India currently has 117 operational aircraft in its fleet, while its arm Air India Express has 63 planes. Under the new owners, Air India has been able to bring back to service 90 per cent of its long-grounded aircraft as well.
Apart from fleet expansion, 2024 will also see Air India kick off the full interior refit of 40 legacy wide-body aircraft—Boeing 777s and 787s. The upgradation exercise, which will include complete replacement of seats and in-flight entertainment system on the legacy wide-body fleet, is expected to start in July, coinciding with Air India’s first A350 aircraft starting international operations. The plane, which started commercial operations this week, is initially flying domestic sectors for a few months for crew familiarisation flights. Air India also plans to start interior upgrades on 41 narrow-body A320 aircraft as well this year.

“Though we still have a long way to go to upgrade the legacy fleet, improve our consistency, close remaining gaps and strengthen fragile processes, the future is now more visible, more tangible and, I hope, more inspiring. Despite—and no doubt somewhat because of—the good progress we’ve made in two short years since privatisation, expectations are high, so we need to keep rising to meet them,” Wilson said.
Over the past two years, Air India has augmented its legacy fleet by taking 36 aircraft on lease, apart from pacing the giant 470-aircraft order with Airbus and Boeing. It has added five domestic and 11 international routes to its network, and opened five new international stations. New brand identities for both Air India and Air India Express were also launched last year.
Ever since Air India returned to the Tata group on January 27, 2022, the new owners have been focusing on sprucing up the product offering, while also planning an extensive expansion for the airline. A five-year roadmap–Vihaan.AI–was prepared with the objective of substantially growing the airline’s network and fleet in a bid to put it on a “path to sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership”.
As per data shared by Wilson with staff, Air India clocked 249 per cent revenue growth over the past two years, while Air India Express’s revenue grew 148 per cent over the period. Wilson did not give further details on the group’s financials.

Red Sea woes: Exporters seek increased credit as freight rates jump 300%,Rising attacks forced shippers to consider the longer route,"Indian exporters have asked the central government to help facilitate more credit as freight rates have jumped nearly 300 per cent due to the disruption in the Red Sea route forcing global shipping lines to take longer trade routes, which is ultimately affecting exports of low value items such as Basmati rice.
Increasing attacks on ships sailing in the Red Sea region since November 2023 have forced shippers to consider the alternative, longer route past the Cape of Good Hope, which has not only stretched delivery time by 15 to 20 days, but also increased the transit cost substantially because of incremental freight rates and insurance premium.
Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai told The Indian Express that freight costs have surged by 300 per cent as global shipping lines are taking the Cape of Good Hope route, which is why exporters have sought more credit to match the rising cost of shipments to Europe.

Meanwhile, ratings agency Crisil on Thursday said that players operating in sectors such as agricultural commodities and marine foods could see a significant impact due to the perishable nature of their goods or lean margin profiles, which limit their ability to absorb the risks from rising freight cost.
“Not all sectors are expected to be impacted to the same extent. In fact, for agricultural commodities like Basmati rice (30-35% of production is shipped to these regions), exporters are feeling the pressure as rising freight cost has curbed exports and a part of their inventory is now being sold in the domestic market, leading to a moderation in realisations,” the report said.
Indian companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa, and parts of the west Asia. Crisil said that these regions accounted for 50 per cent of India’s exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and 30 per cent of imports worth Rs 17 lakh crore last fiscal.
“Marine foods –predominantly shrimp and prawn – could also see a significant impact as 80-90 per cent of the production is exported, more than half of it through the Red Sea. Their perishable nature and lean margins make exporters vulnerable to rising freight cost and competitive pressure from Latin American suppliers,” the report added.

The model code of conduct (MCC), likely to be implemented next month, is being viewed as a final cutoff date, with hectic last-minute parleys being escalated to the highest level in the Indian government across ministries including commerce, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs to thrash out a final consensus, a government official said.
The FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India’s general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.
The UK FTA is crucial as it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.

“For us (India) MCC is the cutoff. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries including commerce ministry, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs,” the official said.
A delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22.
“All chapters are closed but a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket now. Over 90 per cent of the deal has been closed. There have been several issues and chapters closed in the last three months,” the official added.
The MCC is a code containing general precepts for model behaviour during elections conducted by Election Commission (EC). It has an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do once elections are announced which forbids use of official machinery and personnel for the political gains of the party in power.

Hence, the spirit of MCC also requires the bureaucracy or any public servant to not engage or appear to engage in an activity that could work to the advantage of the party in power. Notably, the MCC is only a moral code and lacks any statutory backing, the EC, at best, can censure, advise or pull up the person found violating it.
With the date for MCC fast approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
However, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India’s agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.

While the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country. The average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2% but the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6%
Negotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market too. Indian whisky manufacturers have said that the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier for Indian whisky brands seeking entry into the UK, and is seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.
India’s labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.
India and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK’s investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.
In FY2023, India’s merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-uk-fta-final-push-for-deal-as-window-closing-fast-9127471/,business
Govt close to saturation in implementing social sector schemes: Nirmala Sitharaman,"Even earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the government is close to reaching saturation in implementing social sector schemes designed to provide basic necessities to the poor. Addressing the students of Hindu College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, she said the time has come for India to become economically ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) and march forward to become a developed nation by 2047.
Regretting that 60 years since Independence passed without any sense of urgency, Sitharaman said, “we have laid the material foundation for a Viksit Bharat” and empowering people by providing basic necessities to all.
Even earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.

“So that’s the underlying principle with which between 2014 and today we have done with a sense of urgency. Push the border forward, you take it further. Make sure everybody who’s actually eligible to get those should get it…the approach (of the government) is to empower people, skill people, give access and ensure that everyone gets good health treatment and so on,” she said.
She also said the government has been able to save Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by weeding out dummy and undesirable beneficiaries.
DBT has not only improved transparency in the government fund transfer but also enhanced efficiency through the use of technology, she said.
Stressing that the government doesn’t differentiate between people, Sitharaman said that is the reason why the prime minister categorises India in four groups–Youth, Women, Farmers and Poor– and efforts are made for betterment of these groups irrespective of caste, creed and religion. She also said that India is nearly self-sufficient as far as agriculture is concerned except in oil seeds and pulses.

However, she advocated that one should not waste food as many parts of the world are facing problems.
Terming Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha ceremony of January 22 as a ‘civilisational marker’, she said, this was a fortunate moment for the generation who could witness restoration of civilisational values. She urged the students to focus on skill development as well as on values — both civilisational and nationalistic.
Reminding students that the country celebrates National Voters’ Day on January 25, she said, it is not just the right of citizens to vote but it is their duty also, and the first-time voters have greater responsibility.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/nirmala-sitharaman-hindu-college-govt-close-to-saturation-social-sector-schemes-dbt-9127304/,business

"Hyundai Motor’s Q4 net profit rises 31%, misses forecasts","Hyundai Motor, the world's No.3 automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp, reported a net profit of 2.2 trillion won ($1.65 billion) for the October-December period versus a profit of 1.7 trillion won a year earlier.","South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co on Thursday reported a 31% rise in fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst expectations due to unfavourable exchange rates as well as one-off costs related to the sale of its Russia plant in December.
Hyundai Motor, the world’s No.3 automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp, reported a net profit of 2.2 trillion won ($1.65 billion) for the October-December period versus a profit of 1.7 trillion won a year earlier.
That compared with a 2.9 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted towards estimates from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

In December, Hyundai Motor said it would take a 287 billion won ($219.2 million) loss on selling its plant in Russia, where operations have been suspended since March 2022.
Hyundai is targeting revenue growth of 4.0%-5.0% this year. It expects a 4.9% jump in North American vehicle sales but a 3.7% drop and 0.6% fall in vehicle sales in China and Europe, respectively. It predicted an operating profit margin between 8.0% and 9.0% in line with last year.
“Hyundai Motor expects the business environment will remain difficult to predict, due to macro uncertainties centered on emerging markets and a downturn in the real economy,” Hyundai Motor said in a statement.
Analysts noted that like other automakers, Hyundai is grappling with slowing growth due to a difficult economic environment, including high interest rates and inflation that have pushed vehicles out of the reach of some buyers.

“It appears that pent-up demand for vehicles from limited supplies has been disappearing as high interest rates eat away car buyers’ willingness to purchase,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Lee added that Hyundai Motor would likely manage its vehicle inventory level more tightly than previous years as pent-up demand has disappearing and excessive inventories would hurt its profitability.
Shares in Hyundai Motor were trading up 2.0% after it reported its earnings, outperforming 0.1 rise for the benchmark KOSPI.

Govt permits direct listing by Indian firms on GIFT-IFSC’s international markets,The international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges.,"The government on Wednesday allowed direct listing of securities by public Indian companies on the international exchanges of GIFT International Financial Services Centre (GIFT-IFSC), and made the requisite provisions to provide “an overarching regulatory framework” to facilitate it. In July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government had decided to enable direct listing of listed and unlisted companies on the IFSC exchanges. The move is expected to give Indian companies access to cheaper foreign capital, boost foreign investment, and broaden investor.
The Department of Economic Affairs of the Finance Ministry has amended Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, and notified the Direct Listing of Equity Shares of Companies Incorporated in India on International Exchanges Scheme. Additionally, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Companies (Listing of Equity Shares in Permissible Jurisdictions) Rules, 2024.
“These, together, provide an overarching regulatory framework to enable public Indian companies to issue and list their shares in permitted international exchanges. As of now, the framework allows unlisted public Indian companies to list their shares on an international exchange. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is in the process of issuing the operational guidelines for listed public Indian companies,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges. These exchanges are under the regulatory supervision of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). GIFT-IFSC is India’s first international financial services centre set up with the objective of connecting India with global opportunities while helping the Indian economy connect with the global financial system and facilitating seamless flow of global capital into India.
“This policy initiative…will reshape the Indian capital market landscape and offers Indian companies, especially start-ups and companies in the sunrise and technology sectors, an alternative avenue to access global capital beyond the domestic exchanges. This is expected to lead to better valuation of Indian companies in line with global standards of scale and performance, boost foreign investment flows, unlock growth opportunities and broaden the investor base,” the Finance Ministry said.
Public Indian companies will have the flexibility to access both markets—domestic for raising capital in rupees and international market at IFSC for raising capital in foreign currency from the global investors.
“This initiative will particularly benefit Indian companies going global and having ambitions to look at opportunities for expanding their presence in other markets. It is also expected to provide a boost to the capital market ecosystem at GIFT IFSC by provision of new investment opportunities for investors, diversification of financial products and by enhancing liquidity,” the ministry said.

According to the government, it is not mandatory for an unlisted company intending to list on international exchanges to also list on domestic exchanges. However, there is no restriction on such companies to opt for listing on domestic as well as international exchanges. The equity shares listed on international exchanges will be counted towards the foreign holding of the company. Also, public companies falling under sectors prohibited for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will not be allowed to issue shares under this scheme.
Indian residents will not be allowed to trade or invest in shares of Indian companies on international exchanges. Non-resident Indians (NRIs), however, will be allowed to trade. Individuals and entities from countries sharing a land border with India will also be allowed to trade, subject to approval from the government.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-permits-direct-listing-by-indian-firms-on-gift-ifscs-international-markets-9126380/,business
Sharing of investor data with SEBI: FPIs get seven months to liquidate their holdings,"“There is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings,” sources said. Sebi had earlier asked FPIs to bring down such exposure by January 29, 2024.","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) will get seven months to liquidate their holdings if they do not meet the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s January-end deadline to disclose data about their investors, highly-placed sources said.
In August last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had issued a circular which asked high-risk FPIs, holding more than 50 per cent of their equity AUM in a single corporate group or with an overall holding in Indian equity markets of over Rs 25,000 crore, to disclose granular details of all entities holding any ownership, economic interest, or exercising control in the FPI.
“There is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings,” sources said. Sebi had earlier asked FPIs to bring down such exposure by January 29, 2024.

Explained | FPI disclosure norms deadline extended: Why is SEBI seeking investor data?
If FPIs continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they would have an added 10/30 working days to provide the additional details required, they said. “Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they would have a further 6 months to reduce their holdings,” sources said.
Sources said FPIs which met the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 had time till January 2024 end to rebalance their holdings if they so wished.
FPIs had sold stocks worth over Rs 27,000 crore between January 17-23 in the cash market, according to stock exchange data. FPIs have offloaded Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL). Net FPI outflows, after accounting for their investments in IPOs and debt market, were Rs 4,439 crore in January.
The Sebi’s circular came into effect on November 1, 2023. According to the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by FPI custodians on additional disclosure norms, existing FPIs, which are in breach of the investment limits as on October 31, 2023, would be required to bring down such exposure within 90 calendar days i.e. January, 29, 2024 (settlement date), unless they fall under any of the exempted categories.

According to sources, FPIs which may be required to provide enhanced disclosures are expected to be significantly less than estimated in the consultation paper and the SEBI board note.
In May, Sebi had said that based on the data as of March 31, 2023, FPI assets under management of around Rs 2.6 lakh crore may potentially be identified as high-risk FPIs who would have to make additional disclosures.
Sources said that exemption from enhanced disclosures have been provided to FPIs which are sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), listed companies on certain global exchanges, public retail funds, and other regulated pooled investment vehicles with diversified global holdings.

The markets regulator had mandated additional disclosure norms for high risk FPIs after it observed that certain FPIs were holding concentrated portion of their equity portfolio in a single investee company/ corporate group.
Such concentrated investments raise the concern and possibility that promoters of such investee companies/ corporate groups, or other investors acting in concert, could be using the FPI route for circumventing regulatory requirements such as that of disclosures under Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations, 2011 (SAST Regulations) or maintaining Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) in the listed company, Sebi had said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sharing-of-investor-data-with-sebi-fpis-get-seven-months-to-liquidate-their-holdings-9126379/,business

Also, this week is when the goods and services tax (GST) outflow happens,” said a treasury head of a private sector bank.","The liquidity in the banking system has turned deficit to a record high of Rs 3.4 lakh crore on Wednesday due to moderation in government spending, higher tax outflows and slower bank deposit growth.
Analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to announce permanent liquidity measures such as open market operations (OMO) purchases to ease liquidity deficit conditions in the banking system rather than variable repo rate auctions (VRR) to infuse temporary liquidity.
“The primary reason for this (liquidity deficit) is that the government is not spending much. Also, this week is when the goods and services tax (GST) outflow happens,” said a treasury head of a private sector bank.

Banking system liquidity, as reflected by the amount of money injected by the RBI into the banking system, has been in deficit mode since last month after advance tax and goods and services tax (GST) payments.
On a net basis, the RBI has injected liquidity averaging Rs 1.8 trillion between December 16, 2023 and January 14, 2024.
Higher outflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have also led to the widening of banking system liquidity, analysts said. So far in the current month, FPIs have pulled out Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).
According to Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, the liquidity tightness is a case of deposits rising at a slower pace compared to the growth in credit.

In the fortnight ended December 29, the bank deposits grew by 13 per cent on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, while credit grew by 20 per cent, the latest RBI data showed. The growth includes the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank.
A large amount of retail deposits migrating to mutual funds has also resulted in a slower growth in deposits, Sabnavis said.
The RBI has been conducting VRR auctions to infuse liquidity into the banking system. Between December 16 and January 14, it conducted five variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of 2-7 days maturity and a main operation (13 days) amounting to Rs 1.75 lakh crore. On January 24, the RBI announced a 15-day VRR worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore.

Bankers said the RBI wants liquidity to remain in the deficit mode as consumer priced-based inflation (CPI) continues to remain above its target of 4 per cent. Retail inflation, or CPI, edged up to 5.7 per cent in December 2023 from 5.6 per cent in November.
If the ongoing liquidity conditions persist, the RBI will necessarily have to infuse more durable liquidity into the banking system, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in a report.
“Sustained tightness in the banking system liquidity could prove to be onerous for borrowers and will worsen in case if government spending does not accelerate in a meaningful way. Therefore, the infusion of durable liquidity is becoming necessary and idealistically, the monetary policy stance should change to ‘neutral’ from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to maintain consistency of stance and action,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, Director, Core Analytical Group, Ind-Ra.
While an increase in FPI inflow owing to the inclusion in Global Bond Indices will improve the liquidity situation, the surge in cash-in-circulation ahead of the parliamentary election will keep the RBI on toes, notwithstanding the beginning of government spending in April 2024 and relatively weak credit season, the rating agency said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/banking-system-liquidity-deficit-at-record-high-of-rs-3-4-lakh-crore-9126361/,business

"Online retailer eBay to slash 1,000 jobs, reduce contracts","San Jose, California-based eBay is the latest tech company to roll out a series of layoffs after quickly ramping up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic while people spent more time and money online.","Online retailer eBay Inc will cut about 1,000 jobs, or an estimated 9% of its full-time workforce, saying its number of employees and costs have exceeded how much the business is growing in a slowing economy. It marks the latest layoffs in the tech industry.
CEO Jamie Iannone said in a message to employees on Tuesday that the company also will reduce how many “contracts we have within our alternate workforce over the coming months”.
Those who are being laid off will be told through Zoom calls with their bosses, Iannone said, requesting that people work from home Wednesday to allow privacy for those conversations.

“We need to better organise our teams for speed — allowing us to be more nimble, bring like-work together, and help us make decisions more quickly,” he said in the note, which was posted online.
“These changes are difficult, but I’m confident that by working together we will become stronger than ever,” Iannone added.
San Jose, California-based eBay is the latest tech company to roll out a series of layoffs after quickly ramping up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic while people spent more time and money online.
Now, companies from Google to Amazon have been making painful job cuts to reduce costs and bolster their bottom lines.
ADVERTISEMENT
Just this month, Google said it was laying off hundreds of employees working on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams, while TikTok said its shedding dozens of workers in ads and sales and video game developer Riot Games, behind the popular “League of Legends” multiplayer battle game, was trimming 11% of its staff.
Meanwhile, Amazon said this month that it is cutting several hundred jobs in its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit.
The online retail giant owns two other companies that announced major layoffs in January: Audible, the online audiobook and podcast service, which is trimming about 5% of its workforce, and streaming platform Twitch that is cutting more than 500 jobs.
ADVERTISEMENT
Other tech companies, including Spotify, Microsoft, Meta and IBM, also have recently cut jobs.
They’re running into a slowing economy following rapid interest rate hikes unleashed by central banks around the world to combat soaring inflation.
The head of eBay pointed to those concerns in the need to trim its workforce: “Despite facing external pressures, like the challenging macroeconomic environment, we know we can be better with the factors we control,” Iannone said.
The company has also faced internal problems that hurt its business. The online retailer will pay a $3 million fine to resolve US criminal charges over a harassment campaign waged by employees who sent live spiders, cockroaches and other disturbing items to the home of a Massachusetts couple, according to court documents this month.
The Justice Department charged eBay with stalking, witness tampering and obstruction of justice more than three years after the employees were prosecuted in an extensive scheme to intimidate a couple who produced an online newsletter called EcommerceBytes that upset eBay executives with its coverage.

"Why the hike in import duty for gold, silver findings and coins? Policy makers say move aimed at tackling arbitrage",Rise in gold prices and duties are also seen as the key reasons for higher gold smuggling in the country.,"In a bid to remove the loophole of a tax arbitrage between different types of gold and silver items, the Finance Ministry on Tuesday raised import duty on gold and silver findings and coins of precious metals to 15 per cent. Higher imports of gold and silver findings — which are small components such as hooks, clasps, clamps, pins, screws used to hold the whole or a part of a piece of jewellery in place — led the government to hike the import duty for them at par with gold and silver bars.
Gold and silver bars faced a 15 per cent import duty, while gold and silver findings attracted 11 per cent import duty. Owing to this duty arbitrage, it was found that there was a significant surge in imports of gold findings in the last two months, a senior government official told The Indian Express.

According to a DGCA statement, the action follows a “comprehensive investigation” that was initiated after an airline employee filed a voluntary safety report with the regulator, alleging safety violations on Air India flights “on certain long range terrain critical routes”. The investigation prima facie revealed non-compliance by the airline, after which a show cause notice was issued to Air India.

India’s sunflower imports to falter as Red Sea attacks lift freight costs,"The world's biggest sunflower oil buyer typically sources most of its imports from the Black Sea region via the Red Sea. However, recent Houthi attacks have compelled shipping companies to reroute trade between Europe and Asia around Africa, increasing time and costs.","India’s sunflower oil imports are set to decline in coming months as a rally in prices, driven by a surge in freight rates, is prompting buyers to shift to rival vegetable oils available at a discount, traders told Reuters.
The world’s biggest sunflower oil buyer typically sources most of its imports from the Black Sea region via the Red Sea. However, recent Houthi attacks have compelled shipping companies to reroute trade between Europe and Asia around Africa, increasing time and costs.
The elevated freight rates have lifted the landed cost of sunflower oil above that of soyoil in India for the first time in nearly a year, said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Sunoil imports were robust in the last few months due to the price advantage it had over soyoil. However, it lost this advantage because of rising freight,” he said.
Crude sunflower oil imports are currently offered at about $943 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF), in India for February delivery, while crude soyoil is offered at around $935 and crude palm oil at $933, dealers said.
Two months ago, sunflower oil was trading at a $120 per ton discount to soyoil, which encouraged Indian traders to increase sunoil imports.
In December, India’s sunoil imports more than doubled from a month earlier to 260,850 tons.
ADVERTISEMENT
Soyoil imports in December rose by 1.8% to 152,650 tons but remained significantly below the average imports of 306,000 tons in the marketing year that ended in October 2023.
In January, sunflower oil imports could fall to 225,000 tons as soyoil imports are likely to jump above 230,000 tons, said Rajesh Patel, managing partner at edible oil trader and broker GGN Research.
“In the coming months sunflower oil imports would go down to around 200,000 tons if the current price trend continues,” Patel said.
ADVERTISEMENT
India buys palm oil mainly from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, while it imports soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.
Argentina is currently offering sunoil at more competitive prices than supplies from Black Sea region countries, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trade house. Red Sea shipping disruptions would prompt India to buy more soyoil from South America and less sunoil from the Black Sea region, he said.

Union Budget 2024: Expectations from agriculture sector,It is expected that the agriculture budget for 2024-25 addresses multiple pain-points of the sector simultaneously.,"India’s growing population along with a constant rise in income levels is leading to a constant increase in demand for agricultural products and increasing burden on existing agricultural resources. The prevailing scenario indicates a need to improve productivity along with reducing costs and improving quality to make the most efficient use of the available resources. The growing adoption of cutting-edge agricultural techniques as well as incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), drones, and remote sensing-based technologies in agriculture is a step in the right direction.
Current challenges faced by the sector
Although the agriculture sector has transformed significantly over the last few decades, challenges like fragmented landholdings, low productivity, limited mechanization, minimal value addition opportunities and insufficient credit availability prevent farmers from realizing higher prices. Another major problem is inefficient extension mechanisms, which makes it difficult for advanced agricultural practices to reach each and every farmer. Due to this farmers still use basic, traditional methods for cultivation.

On Monday, Culver Max Entertainment, formerly known as Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), terminated merger agreements with Zee Entertainment, which could have otherwise created a USD 10 billion media enterprise in the country.
“SPNI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, today issued a notice terminating the definitive agreements entered into by SPNI and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) relating to the merger of ZEEL with and into SPNI, which was…announced on December 22, 2021,” a statement by Sony Group Corporation said on Monday.
Sony sent the termination notice to Subhash Chandra family-promoted media and entertainment firm following a stalemate over who will lead the merged entity, besides not satisfying other conditions for the merger.
Sony is also seeking USD 90 million as break-up fees for violating the terms of the merger pact and “invoking arbitration”, which ZEEL said it will contest legally. On the other hand ZEEL said it has spent Rs 366.59 crore on compliances till September 2023 for its merger with Sony.

The company spent Rs 176.20 crore in the financial year that ended in March 2023. Besides, it spent Rs 190.39 crore in the first six months of the current fiscal, according to a regulatory filing by ZEEL.
On December 17 last year, ZEEL had sought an extension of the deadline from Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) under the 2021 agreement.
SPNI had initially said that it had not yet agreed to the deadline extension request by ZEEL. But later, it agreed to discuss the matter.
ADVERTISEMENT
The proposed USD 10-billion merger had already received regulatory approvals from fair trade regulator CCI, NSE and BSE, shareholders and creditors of the company. In August last year, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave a go-ahead to the merger.

"No relook at duty remission scheme needed due to US, EU action: Official","The RoDTEP scheme, announced in January 2021, refunds embedded duties and taxes, such as VAT on fuel used in transportation, mandi tax and duty on electricity. It replaced the WTO-incompatible Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) scheme, which had faced several challenges from WTO members.","The union government does not intend to relook at its Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme after the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) last year imposed countervailing duties on four Indian products citing breach of World Trade Organization (WTO) norms, a government official said.
The US and EU had imposed countervailing duties (CVDs) on paper file folders, common alloy aluminum sheet and forged steel fluid after an anti-subsidy investigation. CVDs are tariffs on imported goods that are imposed to offset subsidies given by the exporting country’s government, aimed at protecting the domestic industry.

The A350-1000 can carry 350-410 passengers, and can cover a little over 16,000 km non-stop.","In a long-bygone era, Air India helmed by JRD Tata was known to be a delight for fliers, with ornate interiors and in-flight services second to none in the world. But most passengers today have only heard about this pinnacle of Air India’s service quality, for they have been used to a product that reflected the carrier’s woes–acute financial distress, excessive government interference, and inefficiencies that mar many a public sector company. Rundown planes with poor upkeep became the hallmark of India’s flag carrier. Now back in the Tata fold after its privatisaton, Air India is aiming to restore the famed status it enjoyed decades ago.

Tata Group bags 5-year IPL sponsorship rights for $300 million,"Some IPL franchise owners have gone on to buy teams in T20 leagues in the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, West Indies and the United States.","Tata Group has bagged the title sponsorship of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for 2024-28 for a “record-breaking” $300 million, the league organisers said on Saturday.
Backed by celebrity franchise owners and featuring the best players in international cricket, IPL has become the world’s richest T20 tournament with an estimated brand value of $8.4 billion.
It has been a cash cow for the Indian cricket board (BCCI) with the 10-team league’s 2023-27 media rights fetching $6.2 billion.

Tata Group has been the title sponsor of both the men’s IPL and the Women’s Premier League, which took off last year.
“The unprecedented financial commitment reflects the immense scale and global impact of the IPL on the international sports stage,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.
Some IPL franchise owners have gone on to buy teams in T20 leagues in the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, West Indies and the United States.
With the IPL franchises offering lucrative multi-league contracts that most cricket boards cannot match, the Indian league’s growth may deepen concerns about players prioritising T20 leagues over international cricket.

“The record-breaking sum … is a testament to the immense value and appeal that the IPL holds in the world of sports,” league chairman Arun Singh Dhumal said.

Boeing expects no ‘meaningful delays’ in aircraft deliveries to India due to 737 MAX 9 problems,"Although India does not have any MAX 9 jets in service, safety regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) mandated a one-time inspection of emergency exits on all their MAX 8 aircraft.","Boeing does not anticipate any “meaningful delays” in its 737 MAX aircraft deliveries to India due to prevailing problems following the recent mid-flight cabin plug door blowout incident on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 plane in the United States (US), the American plane maker’s vice president for commercial marketing Darren Hulst said Friday at Wings India 2024 in Hyderabad. Hulst added that on its part, Boeing is going to focus on quality scrutiny of its aircraft and support the investigation that is underway in the US.
To be sure, no Indian carrier currently operates or even plans to operate the MAX 9 variant of the aircraft, which suffered the plug door blowout. Indian carriers—Akasa Air and the Air India group—have a large number of MAX 8 and MAX 10 aircraft on order, which are to be delivered over the next few years. In 2023, the Air India group ordered 190 MAX family planes. On Thursday, Akasa Air topped up its earlier order of 76 aircraft with another 150-plane order.

Boeing expects no ‘meaningful delays’ in aircraft deliveries to India due to 737 MAX-9 problems,"Boeing's vice president for commercial marketing Darren Hulst added that on its part, Boeing is going to be focussed on quality scrutiny of its aircraft and support the investigation that is underway in the US.","Boeing does not anticipate any “meaningful delays” in its 737 MAX aircraft deliveries to India due to prevailing problems following the recent mid-flight cabin plug door blowout incident on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX-9 plane in the United States (US), the American plane maker’s vice president for commercial marketing Darren Hulst said Friday at Wings India 2024 in Hyderabad.

"Tata Steel to close UK blast furnaces with loss of up to 2,800 jobs","The closures are part of India-owned Tata Steel's plan to turn around its loss-making UK steelmaking business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($634.10 million) of government money.","Tata Steel said on Friday it will close its two blast furnaces in Britain by the end of this year, with the loss of up to 2,800 jobs at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.
The closures are part of India-owned Tata Steel’s plan to turn around its loss-making UK steelmaking business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($634.10 million) of government money.
Tata Steel said about 2,500 roles were likely to go in the next 18 months, with 2,800 jobs affected overall. It will start a consultation process as part of the restructuring and said it would try to maximise voluntary redundancies.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The course we are putting forward is difficult, but we believe it is the right one,” Tata Steel Chief Executive T V Narendran said. “We must transform at pace to build a sustainable business in the UK for the long-term.”
Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people in the UK, but the warning that there could be 3,000 redundancies came in September when the government announced its funding package to safeguard 5,000 jobs.
Trade unions Community, Unite and GMB said in a separate statement that they rejected the Tata Steel plan and would consult members on next steps, including industrial action.
The electric arc furnaces are operated by fewer workers compared to the blast furnaces and the confirmation of the job losses is a major blow for the area, where Tata Steel is a major employer.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tata said it would offer a 130 million pound support package to help affected employees retrain and find new jobs.
VIRGIN STEEL
The switch to electric steelmaking is expected to cut Britain’s carbon emissions by 1.5% as Port Talbot’s coal-fired plant is the country’s biggest single carbon emitter.
Britain has said its financial support for Tata Steel helped to secure the future of the country’s steel industry, because without it, Tata had threatened to shut the plant entirely, citing losses of 1 million pounds a day.
ADVERTISEMENT
But critics of the plan say the industry will be severely diminished because electric arc furnaces make steel from recycling scrap steel, rather than making so-called virgin steel from iron ore, coke and other inputs.
China-owned British Steel, which has two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, northern England, is also in talks with the government about shifting to cleaner manufacturing. Unions have warned of up to 2,000 redundancies.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/tata-steel-close-uk-blast-furnaces-loss-jobs-9117658/,business
Sebi to act against 3 i-bankers found inflating IPO subscriptions: Chairperson Buch,"Buch said the Sebi also has data and evidence on ""mule accounts"", wherein the credentials of an innocent person are used to typically front-run on stocks by those wanting to not leave a trace of trades.","Sebi Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Friday said the capital markets regulator has found that three merchant bankers are frequently indulging in inflating subscriptions during share sales, and promised action against them.
Speaking at an annual convention organised by a lobby grouping of investment bankers here, Buch said the Sebi also has data and evidence on “mule accounts”, wherein the credentials of an innocent person are used to typically front-run on stocks by those wanting to not leave a trace of trades.
There is also a tendency of “inflating the IPO application numbers to give an impression of high amount of subscriptions”, Buch said, adding that Sebi has data and evidence on this.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We are also seeing practices where there is a pattern of which kind of merchant bankers tend to be … frequent names occurring in such malpractices. Therefore, in the interest of the investors, we will be required to both review policy as well as (start) enforcement actions,” Buch said.
It can be noted that the comments come amid a huge surge in IPO activity, wherein many companies have witnessed very high investor demand in the run-up to the listing.

Addressing a press conference, Hulst said to meet rising passenger and cargo demand, South Asian carriers are projected to quadruple the size of their fleets over the next two decades and they will require more than 2,705 new airplanes to address growth and fleet replacement.
“Over 92 per cent of that (2,705) or over 2,500 (aircraft India will need) by 2042. It is based on the (forecast given in) middle of the last year,” he told reporters. “We project that carriers here (South Asia including India) will need more than 2,700 aircraft deliveries by the year 2042,” he said, adding a similar composition of the fleet with more than 2,300 single aisle, nearly 400 wide-body aircraft for the long haul.

According to Boeing, India is the only large economy, a large market in Asia that has evolved to pre-pandemic levels both domestically and internationally in terms of demand. “That reflects how important air travel is in the marketplace, also the strength of the Indian economy and how connected a traveller is to continued growth,” he further said.

Withdrawal of subsidy may lead to stagnated growth of EV industry for 2 years: Ather Energy CEO,"Highlighting the ""repercussions of a sudden subsidy reduction"", Tarun Mehta said that the electric two-wheeler industry lost one year of growth in 2023.","Withdrawal of the government’s incentive on the sale of electric two-wheelers in April would prompt industry players to work hard and this could result in one or two more years of stagnated growth, Ather Energy’s CEO and co-founder Tarun Mehta said on Friday.
“The industry is no longer entirely dependent on subsidies for survival but an early discontinuation of the subsidy in April would prompt industry players to tighten their belts and work hard. Despite this resilience, such a scenario would still result in one or two more years of stagnated growth, pushing the industry further away from its targets,” the CEO of the electric two-wheeler firm said in a statement.
The central government provides incentives on the sale of two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers under the FAME-II (Faster Adoption of Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India) scheme, which is ending in March this year. In June last year, the central government has already reduced the subsidy amount on electric two-wheelers to Rs 10,000 per Kwh from Rs 15,000 per Kwh. It also reduced the maximum subsidy cap of 40 per cent of the ex-factory price of the vehicle to 15 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Highlighting the “repercussions of a sudden subsidy reduction”, Mehta said that the electric two-wheeler industry lost one year of growth in 2023.
“We finished calendar 2023 with the same volume as we began with. If things had gone according to plan, we would have at least doubled that. So, the growth slowed down,” he added. Talking about the electric two-wheeler sales in Chandigarh, Mehta said the city is a frontrunner in EV adoption and the absence of the FAME scheme could potentially impact the ongoing trend.
He further said that the scheme plays a vital role in fostering the adoption of EVs and hybrids across India, contributing to pollution reduction and decreased reliance on fossil fuels.
According to the company statement, affordability still remains a key driver for the widespread adoption of electric two-wheelers in India. High battery costs and supply constraints on components have historically contributed to electric vehicles commanding a premium in the market.
ADVERTISEMENT
The FAME scheme played a pivotal role in mitigating these challenges by providing incentives that made electric mobility more economically viable for consumers, it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/ev-industry-electric-vehicle-subsidy-withdrawl-ather-energy-ceo-tarun-mehta-9117013/,business

“The public stockpiling of food grain is the longest pending issue. Promise was made by the members in the Bali ministerial and then later endorsed by subsequent conferences.

"Akasa Air orders 150 Boeing 737 MAX planes to boost network, capacity",India is the world's third-largest and fastest-growing domestic aviation market.,"Fledgling airline Akasa Air on Thursday announced a firm order of 150 Boeing 737 MAX family planes, taking its total order size for the aircraft to 226.

Poonawalla Fincorp: Busting Myths About CIBIL Score and Loans,"Understanding the truth behind CIBIL score myths is essential for making informed financial decisions. Regularly monitoring your credit score, maintaining a diverse credit portfolio, and responsibly managing your credit are vital to a healthy credit profile. ","The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays a crucial role while applying for a loan. CIBIL scores, ranging from 300 to 900, reflect your creditworthiness and are used by lenders such as Poonawalla Fincorp to assess the risk of extending credit. However, several myths surround CIBIL score, creating confusion among consumers. Read on to bust those myths and get clarity on credit score facts.
Breaking the CIBIL Myths with Poonawalla Fincorp
Following are the CIBIL myths and the actual facts about your CIBIL score:
Myth 1: Checking your CIBIL score frequently will lower it.
Reality: Contrary to this belief, checking your CIBIL score does not impact it negatively. Regularly monitoring your credit score is a responsible financial practice. It allows you to stay informed about your credit health and take necessary actions to improve it.
ADVERTISEMENT
Myth 2: A high income guarantees a high CIBIL score.
Reality: A higher income can positively influence your ability to manage credit, but it does not directly determine your CIBIL score. Your payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit, and recent credit inquiries are crucial factors affecting CIBIL score. A disciplined approach to managing credit is essential, regardless of income level.
Myth 3: Paying off all debts will instantly boost your CIBIL score.
Reality: While paying off debts benefits your credit score, the impact may take time. CIBIL score considers various factors, and improvement takes time. Consistent, responsible credit management, including timely payments and maintaining a healthy credit mix, contributes to a gradual and sustainable increase in your credit score. 
Myth 4: CIBIL score is the only factor lenders consider.
Reality: Lenders use the CIBIL score as one of the key factors when assessing creditworthiness, but they also consider other aspects, such as your income, employment history, and existing debt obligations, when determining your loan eligibility. 
A high CIBIL score alone may not guarantee credit approval, and lenders conduct an evaluation considering different factors, such as income, employment history, etc. 
To conclude 
ADVERTISEMENT
Understanding the truth behind CIBIL score myths is essential for making informed financial decisions. Regularly monitoring your credit score, maintaining a diverse credit portfolio, and responsibly managing your credit are vital to a healthy credit profile. 
A lot of times people aren’t aware that having a good credit score can get them a loan at a lower interest rate. Mr. Abhay Bhutada, MD, Poonawalla Fincorp says, “We have observed that during festive season, people end up taking high-interest loans without doing proper due diligence despite having a good credit history and high credit score which creates unnecessary burden of paying high EMIs.”
So, it is important to bust credit score myths and work towards achieving and maintaining a favorable credit score.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sponsored-business/poonawalla-fincorp-busting-myths-about-cibil-score-and-loans-9115090/,business

India’s growth momentum will be maintained in future years: RBI Governor,"According to the first advance estimate by the National Statistical Office, India's economy is expected to grow at 7.3 per cent in FY2024","India’s growth momentum is likely to be maintained in the coming years helped by the structural reforms undertaken over the past years and due to the macroeconomic and financial stability, said Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday.
 
Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Das said that this is an opportune time for investors to invest in India.
 
“India today deserves a much more serious look because of all that is happening in India. The interest this time around in India is genuine. There is a lot of international confidence in India, the technology story built around India, the growth prospects of India and the stability, that is, the macroeconomic and financial sector stability that India offers,” Das said during a fireside chat session.
 
“India’s growth momentum will be maintained in the future years. I see durable signs of India’s growth momentum being maintained. It is not a one-off comment. It is based on a lot of in-house research and analysis,” he said.
 
After a contraction of 5.8 per cent witnesses in FY2021, the Indian economy grew by 9.1 per cent in FY2022 and 7.2 per cent in FY2023, Das said. According to the first advance estimate, released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the country’s economy is expected to grow at 7.3 per cent in FY2024.
 
Das’s statement comes on a day when global rating agency Fitch Ratings affirmed India’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook. India’s rating is underpinned by a robust medium-term GDP growth outlook and sound external finances, which remain intact as the country has effectively navigated a fraught external environment in the past few years, Fitch Ratings said.
 
Das said despite global challenges, the Indian banking sector has made a remarkable recovery. The RBI has taken a lot of steps to improve the governance in the public and private sector banks, strengthening the regulatory architecture around the non-banking finance companies.
 
When asked about the inflation outlook, Das said inflation has come under control and within the 2-6 per cent band, but the target is 4 per cent.
 
“RBI remains fully committed to bringing inflation closer to around 4 per cent. The trend for the moderation of inflation has begun. When we will reach 4 per cent, I cannot give a date, but we are moving towards that,” he said.
 
In December, the consumer price-based inflation (CPI) stood at 5.69 per cent, up from 5.55 per cent in November.
 
He said core inflation, a measure of the effectiveness of monetary policy, which had touched 6.1 per cent at one point and remained sticky at 6 per cent for some time, has started steadily coming down. In December, the core inflation eased to 3.8 per cent.
 
Das said the easing of core inflation gives confidence that monetary policy is working.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/indias-growth-momentum-will-be-maintained-in-future-rbi-governor-9113118/,business
"High demand, stagnant domestic output pushes up India’s reliance on imported crude oil","Even as the government wants to reduce India’s high dependency on imported crude oil, sluggish domestic oil output in the face of steady growth in domestic demand has led to reliance on imports rising over the years.","India’s reliance on crude oil imports has increased to 87.5% in the first nine months of FY24, as consumption of fuels and other petroleum products increased while domestic oil production largely remained flat.

Trade deficit hits 3-month low; easing commodity prices reduce import bill,Official data showed that goods exports jumped nearly 1 per cent to $38.45 billion in December from $38.05 billion compared to last year.,"Driven by a rise in global demand for engineering and electronic products, India’s goods exports in December rose 1 per cent while the trade deficit narrowed to a three month low due to lower imports on the back of easing commodity prices, official data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Monday showed.
This is only the third instance in the ongoing financial year when the monthly goods exports have risen compared to last year as weak demand from the western countries and property crisis in China slowed global demand.
“India’s merchandise trade deficit printed at $19.8 billion in December 2023, lower than ICRA’s estimate of $22.7 billion, owing to a better-than-expected performance of exports in the month. Given this, we expect the Current Account Deficit (CAD) to print at $16-18 billion in Q3 FY2024, lower than our earlier estimate of over $20 billion, albeit nearly twice the reading seen in Q2 FY 2024,”Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head Research and Outreach, ICRA Ltd said.

However, services exports registered a steep fall of over 10 per cent to $27.88 billion in December compared to $ 31.19 billion last year.
This comes amid a decline in fresh export orders for Indian services firms amid demand slowdown from regions like Australia, Canada, Europe, West Asia and South America. As per HSBC India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index, fresh export orders for Indian services firms grew at the slowest pace in December since June 2023.
“There has been a major decline in the goods trade deficit. We are beating global trends and we hope to do the same in the last quarter of the ongoing financial year. But we are waiting and watching what is happening in the Red Sea region. There will be some negative impact because of the disruption and we will assess the impact next month,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said during the press briefing.
Official data showed that goods exports jumped nearly 1 per cent to $38.45 billion in December from $38.05 billion compared to last year.

Meanwhile imports slipped 4.85 per cent to $58.25 billion from $61.22 billion, taking the trade deficit to a three month low of $19.8 billion.
While engineering exports jumped 10.19 per cent, electronic exports surged 14.41 per cent and iron ore exports jumped a sharp 265.64 per cent, petroleum products exports slipped 17.71 per cent, textile exports declined 12.56 per cent and leather exports declined 10.84 per cent.
Gold imports in December jumped by a sharp 156.47 per cent to $3.03 billion compared to $1.18 billion in the year ago period.

Director General of Foreign Trade Santosh Sarangi said that Increase in gold imports and gems and jewellery exports is partly explained by import of gold using advance authorisation scheme, doing value addition and re-exporting gold jewellery.
“Gold is coming through the advance authorisation route, largely gold bars, which is then going out after conversion into jewellery. In some cases they are taking advantage of the rupee Vostro account, RBI had allowed in July, 2022,” he said, adding that most of such imports are from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, he clarified that such a rise in imports could have happened with or without a trade deal between India and UAE.
“For engineering exporters, it has been quite a challenging time. Tensions in Europe and now in West Asia have caused a fair amount of downside risks. There are projections that global growth would slow down in 2024, and issues like high interest rate and low consumer spending would continue to bite this year as well,” Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC) India Chairman Arun Kumar Garodia said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/trade-deficit-hits-3-month-low-easing-commodity-prices-reduce-import-bill-9110908/,business

Crisis can impact India as 80% of exports to Europe takes place via Red Sea: Official,"Amid deepening tensions in the West Asia region, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday started his two day visit. The union government is also mulling on using alternate trade routes and has asked Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) not to raise insurance premiums amid rising cost of shipping to Europe.","The Red Sea shipping crisis could impact India’s exports to Europe the most as about 80 per cent of the outbound shipments to Europe takes place through the Red Sea region, the commerce and industry ministry said on Monday.
This assumes significance as India’s goods exports to the European Union (EU) have already slowed due to weakening demand in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war. The EU contributes to over 15 per cent of India’s total goods exports.
Moreover, a number of environmental related trade measures such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism and EU’s deforestation law are feared to hit India’s exports going forward.

The ministry said that there has been an increase in attacks on commercial shipping vessels travelling through the lower Red Sea since mid-November and 80 per cent of India’s merchandise trade with Europe passes via Red Sea.
“The cost is increasing due to the Red Sea disruption. But ultimately it will depend on demand. The US exports are also through the Suez route. Transport charges are surging. An additional congestion surcharge is also being charged. But if the demand is robust the shipments will go.
“If they are not time sensitive products they will move. It is a global issue. Whole of commodity moves from the eastern to the western part through the Red Sea route,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said at a press briefing.
The ministry said that the Red Sea region is vital for 30 per cent of global container traffic and 12 per cent of global trade and about 95 per cent of vessels have rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, adding 4000 to 6000 nautical miles and 14 to 20 days to journeys.

“Consignment has been put on hold due to high freight and surcharges (as per EPCs). The sailing of most of the ships have been impacted and generally postponed by 2-3 weeks as the incoming ships, with longer routes, are delayed. As of now, container availability has not been seen as an issue as adequate empties are available. However, the combined impact of higher freight costs, insurance premiums, and longer transit times could make imported goods significantly more expensive,” the ministry said
Indian shipments of low value products such as agriculture and textiles to Europe are primarily expected to face the impact of disruption in the Red Sea region.
Amid deepening tensions in the West Asia region, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday started his two day visit. The union government is also mulling on using alternate trade routes and has asked Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) not to raise insurance premiums amid rising cost of shipping to Europe.
The Indian Express had reported that freight rates to Europe have more than doubled due to security tension in the Red Sea region. Fears of disruptions in the Red Sea region have risen and oil prices have begun inching up ever since the US and the UK on Friday attacked Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for the attacks on their commercial ships in the Red Sea region.

Chief economists expect global economy to weaken in 2024: WEF survey,"Warning of more economic uncertainty on the horizon, the Chief Economists Outlook report of the World Economic Forum (WEF) said the global economic prospects remain subdued.","As the top leaders from across the world gather here for their annual congregation, a survey of chief economists on Monday forecast a weakening of the global economy in 2024 and accelerated geo-economic fragmentation.
Warning of more economic uncertainty on the horizon, the Chief Economists Outlook report of the World Economic Forum (WEF) said the global economic prospects remain subdued.
It said that the global economy continues to grapple with headwinds from tight financial conditions, geopolitical rifts and rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI).
ADVERTISEMENT
More than half of chief economists (56 per cent) expected the global economy to weaken this year, while 43 per cent foresee unchanged or stronger conditions.
The outlook for South Asia and East Asia and Pacific, however, remained positive with a strong majority expecting at least moderate growth in 2024.
China emerged as an exception, with a smaller majority (69 per cent) expecting moderate growth as weak consumption, lower industrial production and property market concerns weigh on the prospects of a stronger rebound.
Globally, a strong majority also said labour markets (77 per cent) and financial conditions (70 per cent) will loosen over the coming year. Although expectations for high inflation have been pared back in all regions, regional growth outlooks vary widely and no region is slated for very strong growth in 2024.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The latest Chief Economists Outlook highlights the precarious nature of the current economic environment,” WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said.
“Amid accelerating divergence, the resilience of the global economy will continue to be tested in the year ahead.
Though global inflation is easing, growth is stalling, financial conditions remain tight, global tensions are deepening and inequalities are rising, ? highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation to build momentum for sustainable, inclusive economic growth,” she added.
ADVERTISEMENT
In Europe, the outlook has weakened significantly since the September 2023 survey, with the share of respondents expecting weak or very weak growth almost doubling to 77 per cent.
In the US and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the outlook is weaker too, with about six in 10 respondents foreseeing moderate or stronger growth this year (down from 78 per cent and 79 per cent, respectively).
There was a notable uptick in growth expectations for Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia, although the views remain for broadly moderate growth.
About seven in 10 chief economists expect the pace of geo-economic fragmentation to accelerate this year, with a majority saying geopolitics will stoke volatility in the global economy (87 per cent) and stock markets (80 per cent), increase localization (86 per cent), strengthen geo-economic blocs (80 per cent) and widen the North-South divide (57 per cent) in the next three years.
As governments increasingly experiment with industrial policy tools, experts are nearly unanimous in expecting these policies to remain largely uncoordinated between countries.
ADVERTISEMENT
While two-thirds of chief economists expect industrial policies to enable the emergence of new economic growth hotspots and vital new industries, a majority also warn of rising fiscal strains and divergence between higher- and lower-income economies.
Chief economists expect AI-enabled benefits to vary widely across income groups, with notably more optimistic views about the effects in high-income economies.
ADVERTISEMENT
A strong majority said generative AI will increase efficiency of output production (79 per cent) and innovation (74 per cent) in high-income economies this year.
Looking at the next five years, 94 per cent expect these productivity benefits to become economically significant in high-income economies, compared to only 53 per cent for low-income economies.
ADVERTISEMENT
Almost three-quarters (73 per cent) do not foresee net-positive impact on employment in low-income economies and 47 per cent said the same for high-income economies.
The views are somewhat more divided on the likelihood of generative AI to increase standards of living and to lead to a decline in trust, with both being slightly more likely in high-income markets.
The Chief Economists Outlook builds on the latest policy development research as well as consultations and surveys with leading chief economists from both the public and private sectors, organized by the WEF’s Centre for the New Economy and Society. The latest survey was conducted in November-December 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/chief-economists-global-economy-weaken-2024-wef-9109845/,business

"IPO boom: Market value of 57 listings in 2023 up 870%, 52 trading at premium","This means investors, mainly promoters and institutional investors, have seen an overall appreciation of Rs 430,000 crore in their wealth from these IPOs.","Investors who put money in initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2023 have seen handsome appreciation in their investments after listing of shares on the stock exchanges. The market value of 57 IPOs listed in the last 12 months has shot up to Rs 479,656 crore, translating to an 870 per cent spurt in investor wealth as these companies raised only Rs 49,434 crore from the market through the IPOs.
This means investors, mainly promoters and institutional investors, have seen an overall appreciation of Rs 430,000 crore in their wealth from these IPOs.
Of the 57 companies listed on the stock exchanges in the last 12 months, share prices of only five companies are trading at a discount. Others have gained up to 236 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, PRIME Database Group, overall public equity fundraising increased by 59 per cent to Rs 1,44,283 crore in 2023 from Rs 90,886 crore in 2022. Of the 57 IPOs, 41 IPOs received a mega response of more than 10 times (of which 16 IPOs were subscribed by more than 50 times) while nine IPOs were oversubscribed by more than three times. The balance seven IPOs were oversubscribed between 1 to 3 times, he said.
The market capitalisation of Tata Technologies is now Rs 47,378 crore while they raised Rs 3,042 crore through the IPO. Its shares were at Rs 1,167.90 on January 12 as against the IPO price of Rs 500 per share. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency’s market capitalisation is at Rs 29,834 crore as against the IPO size of Rs 2,150 crore. Its share price was Rs 111 on January 12 as against the IPO price of Rs 32. Mankind Pharma’s investor wealth is now Rs 88,970 crore as against the IPO size of 4,326 crore from the IPO price of Rs 1,080. Its share price shot up to Rs 2,221.
While promoters and institutional investors hold a lion’s share of this gain through the listing, retail investors who have stayed invested have witnessed significant value appreciation. A retail investor who got 10 shares of Tata Tech shelled out Rs 5,000 in the IPO, and is now sitting on a gain of over Rs 6,000 as the market value of his 10 shares has gone up to Rs 11,679.
The good returns have led to huge oversubscriptions in most IPOs. Learning from the past experience, issuers didn’t opt for overpricing. “The IPO frenzy of the past few months has not stopped. Big names are flocking to the market, attracting the attention of business enthusiasts,” said Mahavir Lunawat, Managing Director, Pantomath Capital Advisors IPOs in recent times have transcended mere financial transactions, grabbing the attention of investors across the board and are no longer confined to just seasoned equity investors, he said. The IPO market was vibrant in 2023, following the bullish trend in the secondary market. 57 IPOs came to the market for subscription to raise funds worth Rs 49,434 crore against 40 IPOs last year (total issue size of Rs 64,000 crore).
ADVERTISEMENT
Going ahead, the pipeline remains strong with sharp increase expected in new-age tech IPOs including Ola Electric, Swiggy and Mobikwik.
Why is the IPO market vibrant? The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gained around 18.74 per cent and 20.03 per cent during the calendar year 2023. As the performance of the IPO market is also linked to the stock market, IPOs have also done well, analysts say.
“Most IPOs last year were profitable for investors, as they were well-priced (buyers’ market). The year 2023 was robust for the overall equity capital market (ECM), and the momentum is expected to continue over the next 12-24 months. Last year, we saw the advent of local investors, including mutual funds, insurance companies, family offices and retail entering the market,” said S Ramesh, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Investment Banking.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moreover, GDP growth in the first half of FY24 stood at 7.7 per cent led by a robust print in manufacturing and investment sectors. This led to the Reserve Bank of India revising its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast upwards to 7 per cent for FY24. Such optimistic expectations for real GDP growth have boosted the market. Even other high-frequency data points (GST collections, automobile sales, power demand and PMI data) witnessed robust growth. On the other hand, the first half of FY24 corporate earnings ended on a buoyant note with Nifty companies delivering 30 per cent YoY profit growth, according to a Motilal Oswal report.
The confidence of the investors regarding political continuity post 2024 Lok Sabha elections has received a big boost, it said, adding, “this augurs well for macro and policy momentum for India, which, at the moment, is seeing the highest growth among major economies (both GDP as well as corporate earnings).”
Kotak Investment Banking’s Ramesh said this year fundraising activity may temporarily slow down due to the elections in India and the US, but the IPO momentum is unlikely to stop. While 2023 was the year of mid-cap IPOs with an average deal size of Rs 750-800 crore, this year, the average IPO size is expected to return to Rs 1,500 crore.
“We expect a diversified set of companies to hit the market this year, including larger financial and tech services, manufacturers, and infra companies going public. Additionally, new-age tech listings will happen in the next 12-24 months,” Ramesh said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/ipo-boom-market-value-of-57-listings-in-2023-up-870-52-trading-at-premium-9109432/,business

And I was told by experts yesterday that our lentil production may probably be the highest in the world as a country this year,” Singh said during a roadshow ahead of the Global Pulse Conference (GPC), being held in February in New Delhi.

In a two-part investigation published on November 20-21, The Indian Express had reported how dubious loan apps advertise on Instagram and Facebook, and, despite whatever filters the platforms claim to use, many such apps, including those red-flagged by the government, continue to offer their services. It had also reported that the RBI initially did not have a whitelist of registered loan apps, or even a negative list which is updated.

Indian manufacturing unit to be operational by early 2025: Micron,The investment was first announced during the US visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2023 and construction had begun in September.,"Global memory and data storage major Micron Technology on Thursday said the first phase of its plant in Gujarat’s Sanand will become operational in early 2025.
It has already started construction of the plant by roping Tata Projects, and the hiring process has also begun, the US-based company’s president and chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit here.
“The first phase, which will include 5,00,000 square feet of plant clean room space, will become operational in early 2025,” he said.
The investment was first announced during the US visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2023 and construction had begun in September. Micron has committed to invest over USD 800 million in the plant of the over USD 2.75 billion cost.

The “clean room” typically hosts an Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) plant which operates in near-zero dust and vibration environment.
Mehrotra said the company will ramp up capacity over time as per global demand and added that it will begin the construction of the second phase of the facility in the latter half of the current decade.
Mehrotra said the combined investment by Micron and the government of India, which is supporting the project through a dedicated platform for creating a semiconductor ecosystem in the country, in the plant is USD 2.75 billion. “Government support will help fund the project and also facilitate access to essential semiconductor infrastructure and resources, which will drive innovation and enhance local talent development,” he said.
Micron chose Gujarat because of the strong manufacturing infrastructure here, he added. “We are hopeful this investment will help catalyse other investments in the sector, indigenous manufacturing capability, encourage innovation and support broader job creation,” Mehrotra said.

"Modi most successful Indian PM, greatest global leader, says Mukesh Ambani","Mukesh Ambani said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks, the whole world not only listens but applauds.","Narendra Modi is India’s most successful Prime Minister and the greatest global leader of current generation, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said on Wednesday as he flaunted his group Reliance Industries’ Gujarati heritage and its over $150 billion (Rs 12 lakh crore) investment in last 10 years.
With Prime Minister Modi on the dias, Ambani termed the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit — which was conceived when Modi was chief minister of the state two decades back — as “the most prestigious investor summit in the world”.
“Our beloved leader who has emerged as the greatest global leader of our times. And he is Shri Narendrabhai Modi, the most successful Prime Minister in India’s history,” said the head of India’s most valuable company Reliance Industries Ltd.
ADVERTISEMENT
He went on to state that when Modi speaks, the whole world not only listens but applauds. “My friends abroad ask me: What is the meaning of the slogan that millions of Indians are chanting: Modi hai to Mumkin Hai? I tell them: It means, India’s Prime Minister makes the impossible possible with his vision, determination and execution! They agree, and they also say: ‘Modi hai to mumkin hai!” he said.
Flaunting his Gujarati roots, Ambani said, “I am a proud Gujarati” and “Reliance was, is, and will always remain a Gujarati company.” “When foreigners think of New India, they think of New Gujarat. How did this transformation happen? Because of one leader. Most respected Shri Narendrabhai Modi ji,” he said.

The coming generations, he said, will “indeed be thankful to Prime Minister Modi for being both a nationalist and an internationalist”. “You have laid a solid foundation for ‘Vikasit Bharat’ – India as a fully developed nation in Amrit Kaal. No power on earth can stop India from becoming a USD 35 trillion economy by 2047 (from under USD 3 trillion now). And as I see Gujarat alone will become a USD 3-trillion economy,” he said.
As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi used to say ‘Bharat ke vikas ke liye Gujarat ka vikas (Gujarat’s development for India’s development), helping make the country’s growth engine,” he said. “Now as Prime Minister of India, your mission is – Duniya ke Vikas ke liye Bharat ka Vikas (India’s development for the good of the world). You are working on the mantra of global good and make India the world’s growth engine.” The story of Modi’s journey from Gujarat to the global stage in just two decades is nothing short of a modern epic, he said. “The Modi era will take India to new summits of prosperity, progress and glory.” Ambani said his oil-to-telecom conglomerate invested over USD 150 billion in creating world-class assets and capacities across India in the last 10 years. Of this, more than one-third has been invested in Gujarat alone.
“Today I would like to make five commitments to the people of Gujarat. First, Reliance will continue to play a leading role in Gujarat’s growth story with significant investments in the next ten years,” he said.

Specifically, Reliance will contribute to making Gujarat a global leader in green growth. “We will help Gujarat’s target to meet half of its energy needs through renewable energy by the year 2030. For this, we have started building the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar. This will generate a large number of green jobs and enable production of green products and materials and will make Gujarat a leading exporter of green products. And we are ready to commission this in the second half of 2024 itself,” he said.

Secondly, telecom arm Reliance Jio completed the fastest roll-out of 5G infrastructure anywhere in the world.
“Today Gujarat is fully 5G enabled.” The 5G-enabled AI revolution will make Gujarat’s economy more productive, more efficient and more globally competitive, he said, adding besides generating millions of new employment opportunities, it will produce AI-enabled doctors, AI-enabled teachers and AI-enabled farming, which will revolutionise healthcare, education and agricultural productivity in Gujarat.
“Third, Reliance’s Retail will further accelerate its mission to bring quality products to consumers and simultaneously empower lakhs of kisans and small merchants,” he said.

"Japan’s Nikkei breaks 35,000 for first time in nearly 34 years",The index was also on its way to the largest weekly gain since late March 2020.,"Japan’s Nikkei share average scaled its highest levels since February 1990 on Thursday, as a weaker yen buoyed exporters and caution over an impending hike by the Bank of Japan continued to fade on the back of weak wage data.
The Nikkei rose 1.77 per cent on its third straight day of gains this week, closing at its highest in nearly 34 years at 35,049.86. The index was also on its way to the largest weekly gain since late March 2020.
The broader Topix rose 1.57 per cent to end at 2482.87.
The strong earthquake that hit western Japan last week and lacklustre wage growth data are forcing market participants to “reappraise” when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will normalise its monetary policy, said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG.
ADVERTISEMENT
Workers’ real wages shrank for a 20th straight month in November, according to data published on Wednesday, confounding officials’ wishes to see wage gains before tightening policy.
“That (wage data) gave the Nikkei the excuse to pop up there, towards that 35,000 level,” said Sycamore, adding the index “probably can continue to make good gains while we try and work out when the BOJ can look to take its next step.”
The yen fell 0.9 per cent on the US dollar overnight in the wake of the data and was hovering around 145.52 during Asian trading hours.
A weaker yen tends to support exporter shares, increasing the value of overseas profits in yen terms when firms repatriate them to Japan.

Boeing has sent written orders to its own plants and those of its suppliers to ensure such problems are addressed and to carry out broader checks of systems and processes, they said.
Boeing shares fell 1.4% on Tuesday as United canceled 225 daily flights, or 8% of its total, while Alaska Airlines canceled 109, or 18%. Similar cancellations were expected on Wednesday.
Calhoun also told Boeing employees the company would “ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe.”

He praised the Alaska Airlines crew that swiftly landed the plane, with only minor injuries to the 171 passengers and six crew.
Calhoun, who was a Boeing board member when all MAX jets were grounded in 2019, also praised Alaska Airlines for quickly grounding its 737 MAX 9 jets, adding he knew “how hard it is to ground planes, much less the fleet,” the sources said.
Some industry leaders have privately criticized Boeing for not grounding planes faster on Saturday. People familiar with the matter say it had been drawing up plans to order inspections when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intervened with an emergency order to ground 171 planes.
Boeing voiced support for the FAA’s action, and the company’s contrite tone on Tuesday contrasted with statements that were criticized as legalistic after the 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia.
US-based crisis communications expert Paul Oestreicher, who critiqued Boeing in 2019 for taking weeks to acknowledge its mistakes after the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, said this time Calhoun was “acting with much more speed, acknowledging the importance of transparency, expresses some empathy, and commits to a fix.”

Boeing declined to comment on Calhoun’s remarks beyond the official excerpt.
Inspection protocol

Boeing has checked the service records of earlier Boeing 737-900ER aircraft that had a similar door plug, but all have undergone extensive maintenance since being delivered and none has shown a sign of similar problems, the sources said.
Airlines have not yet started official inspections of their grounded aircraft.
ADVERTISEMENT
The FAA said Tuesday that Boeing was revising its instructions for inspections and maintenance, which the regulator must still approve before checks can begin. The FAA said it “will conduct a thorough review” and public safety will determine the timeline for returning the MAX to service.
Boeing ended 2023 in second place behind rival Airbus in aircraft deliveries for the fifth year running, after seeing its roughly 50% share of the market eroded by the earlier crisis, sources said.
The latest problems could prompt the FAA to take a harder line on certifying designs for other models, including required changes to the smaller MAX 7.
Boeing has sought an exemption to allow certification before the design changes that analysts say is much less likely now.
Two senior industry sources said they expected the plane awaited by Southwest Airlines to face another six-month delay.
FAA head Mike Whitaker, who took the job in October, will testify before Congress next month and could face questions about approval of the 737 MAX planes. The hearing was in the works before the incident on the Alaska Airlines flight.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/boeing-ceo-mid-air-blowout-737-max-aircraft-9102757/,business

Since opening its first cafe in October 2012, Tata Starbucks’ store count has grown to 390. It has opened 57 stores so far this fiscal year and had added 71 in the previous fiscal.
The coffee chain said it plans to enter Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India and increase the number of its drive-through, airport-based and 24-hour cafes. It aims to double its headcount to 8,600.

"Rupee closes little changed, awaits key US inflation data","Late on Monday, Bloomberg Index Services proposed including eligible Indian bonds in its emerging market local currency index from September","The Indian rupee ended little changed on Tuesday after dollar demand from state-run banks ate into the local unit’s early gains in light of a proposal to include eligible Indian bonds in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Currency Index.
The rupee ended at 83.1150 against the U.S. dollar, barely changed compared to its close at 83.1375 in the previous session.
Late on Monday, Bloomberg Index Services proposed including eligible Indian bonds in its emerging market local currency index from September.

The local unit had risen to an intraday high of 83.0450 early in Tuesday’s session on the back of positive sentiment but dollar demand from state-run banks ate into those gains, traders said.
“(It) seems that the market is convinced that 83.00 will hold and hence intraday (dollar) buying comes,” a foreign exchange trader at a private bank said, referring to the persistent dip-buying interest (on USD/INR).
The dollar index was up slightly at 102.35 while most Asian currencies ticked up, led by the Thai baht, which rose 0.4%.
The rupee should appreciate further given supportive global cues, but dollar demand from oil companies and likely absorption of inflows by the Reserve Bank of India have capped gains, Abhilash Koikkara, head of forex and rates at Nuvama Professional Clients Group said.

"Income inequality declines, says SBI research unit countering K-shaped eco recovery claims","The number of ITRs filed by people earning between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 25 lakh increased by 291 per cent while the total number of persons filing income tax increased to 7.4 crore in AY23 from 7 crore in AY22. For AY24, 8.2 crore ITRs have been filed by December 31, 2023.","Income inequality has declined in India with a higher tax base and a shift in taxpayers from lower income to higher income tax bracket, the Economic Research Department of the State Bank of India said in a report released Monday. Terming the claims of K-shaped recovery as “prejudiced” and “ill-concocted”, the report also cited the transition of small firms into larger firms and consumption trends such as the rising trend of ordering from food ordering platforms such as Zomato of being indicative of “vanishing inequality”.
About 36.3 per cent of taxpayers have moved from lower income to higher income tax bracket resulting in 21.3 per cent additional income, the report said adding that the top 2.5 per cent of taxpayers’ contribution in income declined from 2.81 per cent in FY14 to 2.28 per cent in FY21. The income-tax returns (ITRs) filed by individual taxpayers earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, climbed by 295 per cent between the assessment years (AY) 2013–14 and AY 2021–22, showing a positive trend of migration to a higher range of gross total income, the report said.

The easing was due to a 14 per cent and 3 per cent on-month decrease in prices of onion and tomato with the festival season coming to an end. The cost of the non-vegetarian thali declined faster due to a 5-7 per cent on-month decline in the price of broilers, which account for 50 per cent of the cost, the agency said.

Within a year, this is the second successful launch of a residential project from DLF in the Gurugram market. In March last year, DLF Ltd had sold 1,137 luxury apartments in its housing project ‘The Arbour’ in Gurugram for over Rs 8,000 crore.
In a regulatory filing on Monday, DLF announced “pre-formal launch sales of approximately Rs 7,200 crore for its latest luxury residential development, DLF Privana South in Gurugram.” The new project, spread over 25 acre in Sectors 76 and 77, Gurugram, comprises 1,113 luxury residences across 7 towers. There are 14 penthouses and rest are apartments.

“This luxury residential offering by DLF was sold out within 72 hours, in its pre-launch phase,” DLF said.
The size of each apartment would be some 3,500 square feet. The new project will be part of a larger development, ‘DLF Privana’ spread over 116 acre.
In an interview with PTI, Aakash Ohri, Joint Managing Director and Chief Business Officer, DLF Home Developers Ltd, said, “The company pre-launched this new project last month. The entire project was sold out within three days December 22-24.” He said the company received expression of interests (EOIs) from around 4,600 customers.
The selling price was Rs 18,000 per square feet. The price of apartments ranged between Rs 6.25-7.5 crore. Penthouses cost Rs 11-14 crore each.
“We have received very good demand from across India and NRIs. Indian diaspora has booked 25 per cent of the units offered,” Ohri said.

Out of the total units, he said around 85 per cent are end-users and 15 per cent investors. On the operational performance, DLF had sold properties worth Rs 4,268 crore in the first half of this fiscal.
In December, DLF had announced sale of Rs 1,400 crore worth independent floors and shop-cum-offices plots in Panchkula and Gurugram.
With this fresh sale of Rs 7,200 crore, DLF’s sale bookings in the third quarter is estimated to touch Rs 9,000 crore.
In the first nine months, the sale bookings would cross Rs 13,000 crore, beating the annual guidance given by the company for the full 2023-24 fiscal.

In the last financial year, DLF had sold properties worth Rs 15,000 crore, highest among all listed entities.
“The swift pre-launch sellout serves is a testament to the increasing demand for high-rise luxury developments by DLF…,” Ohri said.
He said the company would start construction of this project, comprising 4 million square feet area, in the next 4-5 months.
To discourage bulk bookings, DLF said each buyer was allotted only one unit, with about 25 per cent of the sales coming from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), and a booking amount of Rs 50 lakh. Ohri highlighted that the market rate in ‘The Arbour’ project has increased to Rs 21,000 from Rs 18,000 per square feet.
DLF has developed more than 158 real estate projects and an area in excess of 340 million square feet. DLF Group has 215 million square feet of development potential across residential and commercial segment. The group has an annuity portfolio of over 42 million square feet.

"Zee, Sony yet to agree on merger conditions as deadline for extended negotiation nears",The two parties are yet to come to an agreement over Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) MD and CEO Punit Goenka leading the merged entity after Sony expressed concerns after market regulator Sebi barred him from holding managerial posts in Zee and any of the entities in a fund-diversion case.,"The fate of the USD 10 billion merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Culver Max Entertainment, formerly Sony Pictures Networks India, is hanging by a thread, with the two parties unable to finalise an agreement as the end of the one-month grace period looms.
The two parties are yet to come to an agreement over Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) MD and CEO Punit Goenka leading the merged entity after Sony expressed concerns after market regulator Sebi barred him from holding managerial posts in Zee and any of the entities in a fund-diversion case.
Though the Securities and Exchange Board of India order was stayed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Sony is not comfortable with Goenka leading the merged entity due to the stringent corporate governance policy in Japan. The contentious issue is not just over Goenka leading the merged entity, but the completion of the deal also depends on how the Indian firm is able to meet the other closing conditions, said an industry source.
ADVERTISEMENT
The deal, which was signed between Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures Networks India in 2021, has a stipulated period of two years in which the merger was to be completed before December 21, 2023, including regulatory and other approvals with a grace period of one month to complete the transaction.

By January 21, the one-month grace period for extended negotiations will end. Comments from Sony and ZEEL could not be obtained.
According to reports, the bone of contention is the driving seat of the merged entity. As per the agreed terms and conditions, Goenka was to lead the merger entity.
However, Culver Max Entertainment Pvt Ltd (CMEPL) is insisting on making way for its Sony Pictures Network head NP Singh.

On December 17, the Subhash Chandra family promoted firm sought an extension of the December 21, 2023, deadline from Sony Group Corporation (SGC) firm Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) under the Merger Cooperation Agreement dated December 22, 2021.
Earlier, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) stated that it has not yet agreed to a deadline extension requested by ZEEL for their merger proposed USD 10-billion merger. However, a day after it agreed to discuss the matter. The proposed USD 10-billion merger of ZEEL, BEPL and CMEPL has already received regulatory approvals from the fair trade regulator CCI, bourses NSE and BSE, shareholders and creditors of the company.
In August this year, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave a go-ahead to the merger of ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment.
ADVERTISEMENT
This followed an interim order by Sebi barring Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd MD and CEO Punit Goenka from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel in any listed company. The market regulator took action after they were found diverting funds from the company.
Chandra and Goenka moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging the Sebi interim order. In October, SAT quashed the Sebi interim order.
Earlier in September 2021, then Sony Pictures Networks India and ZEEL entered into a non-binding term sheet to bring together their linear networks, digital assets, production operations and programme libraries. The combined entity will own over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India.
Subsequently, the two parties signed a definitive agreement for their merger in December 2022. The majority of the board of directors of the combined entity would be nominated by the Sony Group and include the current SPNI Managing Director and CEO NP Singh.
However, questions over the future of the merger arose after Sebi’s actions against Chandra and Goenka for siphoning off funds of ZEEL.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/zee-sony-merger-deadline-negotiation-9100653/,business

Following the mid-flight cabin plug door blowout incident on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX-9 aircraft in the United States (US) on Friday, the DGCA on Saturday directed the three carriers to conduct a “one-time inspection” of emergency exits on all of their Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircraft.
Akasa Air, SpiceJet, and Air India Express are the only Indian carriers that have the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in operation. Although none of the Indian carriers have the MAX-9 variant that was involved in the incident, the DGCA asked Indian carriers to inspect the aircraft as an “abundant precautionary measure”, given that the MAX-8 and MAX-9 are part of the same aircraft family and have numerous similarities. The DGCA directive required the three Indian carriers operating the 737 MAX-8 to complete the inspections by noon on Sunday.

Tax authorities have undertaken special drives on the issue of non-existent/bogus registrations and issuance of fake invoices without any underlying supply of goods and services.
The special drive against fake registrations under GST began in mid-May last year. The Indian Express had reported in April last year about several such instances of evasion by bogus firms such as a company showing manpower supply from Gujarat to Bihar for services, instead of supply of goods, to avoid generating e-way bills which are mandatory for inter-state transportation of goods worth at over Rs 50,000. There were also instances of Aadhaar of businesses getting linked to mobile numbers of random individuals, who then started getting OTPs, multiple GST registrations originating from the same premise, with fake documents produced in many of these cases. These instances of frauds came under the radar of tax authorities under the GST regime, prompting them to initiate a special drive against registration-linked frauds in 2023-24 after discussions having taken place at the top level in the government.
Since then, a total 29,273 bogus firms involved in suspected Input Tax Credit (ITC) evasion of Rs 44,015 crore have been detected, the Ministry said. “This has saved Rs 4,646 crore of which Rs 3,802 crore is by blocking ITC and Rs 844 crore is by way of recovery. So far, 121 arrests have been made in the cases,” it said.
With no major GST rate tweaks expected before the general elections, which are likely to happen in the next few months, in a bid to bolster revenue collections, tax authorities have identified registration-linked frauds as one of the key focus areas for tighter scrutiny in the financial year 2023-24. The government has taken various measures for the GST registration process. Pilot projects of biometric-based Aadhaar authentication at the time of registration have also been launched in the states of Gujarat, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh.

The government has also taken measures to curtail evasion such as sequential filing of GST returns, system generated intimation for reconciliation of the gap in tax liability in GSTR-1 & GSTR- 3B returns and of the gap between ITC available as per GSTR-2B and ITC availed in GSTR-3B returns, use of data analytics and risk parameters for detection of fake ITC among others.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/29273-bogus-firms-gst-evasion-of-rs-44015-crore-detected-since-may-23-9099304/,business

Freight rates have doubled due to Red Sea disruptions: Official,"This comes after global shipping giant Maersk on Friday decided to extend its diversion of vessels from the Red Sea for the “foreseeable” future, sparking fears of a sharp rise in freight and insurance cost for Indian products.","Freight rates to Europe — India’s second largest export destination — via the Red Sea region have almost doubled due to rising attacks along the crucial shipping route, a senior government official told The Indian Express.
This comes after global shipping giant Maersk on Friday decided to extend its diversion of vessels from the Red Sea for the “foreseeable” future, sparking fears of a sharp rise in freight and insurance cost for Indian products.

“Multiple things are getting mixed here. Normally, the freight rates range from $500 to $600 through this route to Europe. But the peak season which is between January to March goes up to $1,500. Exporters have informed that this rate has gone to $2,000. Over and above there (war risk) surcharges being added which is taking the freight rates to nearly $3,000,” the official said.

The Indian Express had earlier reported that exports of low- value products such as textile and agriculture could get hit as exporters are holding back the consignments due to rising freight cost. This comes at a time when Indian textile exports have been on the decline due to weak demand in the West.
Meanwhile, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that New Delhi must prepare for long term shipping disruptions at the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.

“India’s approach should include looking for alternative trade routes that bypass the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, negotiating contracts for oil and liquified natural gas with alternate suppliers, offering humanitarian aid to Yemen, negotiating freight with international shipping companies, and paying part of increased insurance expenses,” GTRI said.
India, heavily reliant on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait for crude oil and LNG imports and trade with key regions, faces substantial economic and security risks from any disruption in this area, the think tank said, stating that approximately 65 per cent of India’s crude oil imports in FY 2022-23, valued at $105 billion, from countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and others, likely passed through the Suez Canal.

“For overall merchandise trade with Europe and North Africa, about 50 per cent of imports and 60 per cent of exports, totaling $113 billion, might have used this route. The conflict has necessitated India to consider alternative routes, such as going around Arica via the Cape of Good Hope, which could lead to increased energy costs. India might look to diversify its sources of crude oil and LNG, and explore alternative trade routes to reduce dependency on the conflict-prone Red Sea passage,” the report said.
This conflict is leading to increased shipping costs (40-60 per cent) and delays due to rerouting (upto 20 days more) , higher insurance premiums(15-20 per cent), and potential cargo loss from piracy and attacks, it added.

On Friday, an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX-9 plane operating a flight between Portland and Ontario (in California) made an emergency landing soon after take-off after a mid-air window blowout that led to a section of the fuselage also breaking away, causing decompression in the cabin. All the 171 passengers and six crew on board the aircraft returned safely. Following the incident, Alaska Airlines has temporarily grounded all of its 737 MAX-9 planes.

On Saturday, the American aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that it will order temporary grounding of certain 737 MAX-9 aircraft operated by US airlines or in US territory, and they will be allowed to take to the skies again only after being inspected by operators. The inspection is likely to take four to eight hours per plane. This decision is expected to affect 171 aircraft.
“Following tonight’s event on Flight 1282, we have decided to take the precautionary step of temporarily grounding our fleet of 65 Boeing 737-9 aircraft. Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections. We anticipate all inspections will be completed in the next few days,” Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Airlines, said in a statement after the incident.

The incident comes a few days after Boeing asked 737 MAX operators to carry out inspections after a loose bolt was found in the rudder control system of one of the planes. Rudders are vertical flight control surfaces on the tail of the aircraft and are primarily used to change the airplane’s yaw, or vertical axis rotation.

Higher govt spend & investment set stage for 7.3 pc growth in FY24,India posts 7%-plus growth rate for the third time in a row,"India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow 7.3 per cent in 2023-24, according to the first advance estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) Friday.
The 7 per cent-plus growth rate in FY24 — the third year in a row, and in the backdrop of poor global conditions and a slowing down of the world economy  — comes ahead of national elections likely to be held in a few months from now.
The first advance estimates of growth is marginally up from 7.2 per cent in 2022-23, but way higher than the government’s initial growth estimate of 6.5 per cent.

Higher investment coupled with government expenditure along with a pickup in sectoral outputs of mining, manufacturing, construction and financial services, are seen supporting the higher GDP growth. Agriculture and trade, hotels, transport and communication services seem to be slowing down.

Consumption demand is, however, seen tepid in the current financial year. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) — indicator of consumption demand — is seen growing at 4.4 per cent in 2023-24, the slowest pace in two decades barring the pandemic year of FY21. The previous low for PFCE growth rate was 2.9 per cent in 2002-03. It grew at 7.5 per cent in 2022-23. In contrast, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) is seen sharply up at 4.1 per cent in FY24 as against 0.1 per cent in the previous year.
Investments — as reflected in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) — are expected to stay at a high level of 10.3 per cent in FY24 as against 11.4 per cent in 2022-23.
The first advance estimates of GDP, obtained by extrapolation of data of the first seven-eight months of the ongoing financial year (FY24), are released early to help officers in the Union Ministry of Finance and other departments in framing the broad contours of Union Budget for the next financial year which is to be presented in Parliament on February 1.

Nominal GDP, which takes into account inflation, is estimated to grow at 8.9 per cent in 2023-24, sharply lower than 16.1 per cent, reflecting the deflation in the wholesale price index (WPI) that is used in calculating the GDP deflator. The annual GDP deflator growth is estimated to be at a 48-year low of 1.4 per cent in 2023-24, as per India Ratings. This is expected to affect the government’s fiscal deficit calculations as the Union Budget for 2023-24 had assumed a nominal GDP growth of 10.5 per cent.
The First Revised Estimates of national income for 2022-23 are due for release on February 29 which may also lead to revision in growth rate of first advance estimate for FY24, NSO said.
Both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government had earlier projected a growth rate of 6.5 per cent for FY24, but in its December policy, the RBI revised up the real GDP growth forecast to 7 per cent for FY24.

“Despite global headwinds, the growth momentum witnessed in FY24 is indicative of the Indian economy’s resilience. However, the road ahead is not going to be easy so long as PFCE does not recover fully and become broad based. Here the key would be to watch the wage growth especially of the households belonging to the lower income bracket because that is what is critical for broad basing the consumption demand. The data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket was marginally negative in 2QFY24. Ind-Ra’s calculation shows that a 1% increase in real wages could lead to a 1.12% increase in the real PFCE and the multiplier effect of this could result in a 64 bp increase in the GDP growth,” India Ratings’ Sunil Kumar Sinha and Paras Jasrai said in a note.
The per capita real GDP is expected to increase by 6.4 per cent in FY24, while per capita net national income is seen growing 6.3 per cent to Rs 1.05 lakh as against Rs 98,374 last year. “…during the pre pandemic years, the real per capita GDP growth was averaging 5.3%. Additionally, per capita PFCE in real terms will expand by 3.5% in FY24. The post pandemic average of per capita PFCE however is at 6.7%, against 5.5% in pre pandemic era,” State Bank of India’s Group Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a note.
Sectorally, manufacturing is seen growing at 6.5 per cent in FY24 as against 1.3 per cent growth in the previous year, while mining and quarrying is expected to grow at 8.1 per cent from 4.6 per cent. Construction is expected to post double-digit growth of 10.7 per cent. Agricultural output is, however, seen slowing down with 1.8 per cent growth in 2023-24 as against 4 per cent in the previous year.
Services sector growth is also projected to moderate to 7.7 per cent in FY24 from 9.5 per cent growth in the previous year. While financial, real estate and professional services are seen growing at 8.9 per cent, higher from 7.1 per cent a year ago, trade, hotels, transport and communication services are seen growing at a slower rate of 6.3 per cent in FY24 than 14 per cent in the previous year.

With the first advance estimates of GDP at 7.3 per cent for FY24, back of the envelope calculations show that the Indian economy is estimated to grow 7 per cent in October-March, slower than 7.7 per cent growth in April-September.

EXPLAINED
Resilience in slowing world
INDIA continues to post the fastest growth rate amidst a slowing global economy, clearly indicating a resilience despite worries in many parts of the world. A pick up in private consumption can broadbase economic growth.
“In our view, the growth assumed for H2 FY2024 is quite high, given the tepid outlook for agriculture amidst the weak kharif output and ongoing lag in rabi sowing, as well as the feared temporary slowdown in capex ahead of the General Elections,” Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head – Research and Outreach, ICRA said.

For the second half in FY24, the GDP projection of 7.3 per cent factors in a slowdown in PFCE at 4.4 per cent as against 4.5 per cent growth in the first half. “The concerning aspect in the GDP data is the weak consumption growth at 4.4% (for FY24). This would be the slowest consumption growth in the past two decades barring the pandemic year of FY21. Investment has grown by a strong 10.3% led by strong capex by Centre and the state governments. However, for the investment growth to be sustained it is very important for the consumption growth to be bolstered,” Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge Ratings said.
Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) is also seen slowing down in the second half to 3.1 per cent from 5.1 per cent growth in the first half.

Institutional investors should disclose short-sell transactions upfront: Sebi,Short-selling is the sale of a stock which a person does not own at the time of trade but has merely borrowed.,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Friday told institutional investors to disclose all short-sell transactions upfront at the time of placing an order. The regulator, however, permitted retail investors to make a similar disclosure by the end of the trading hours on the transaction day.
Short-selling is the sale of a stock which a person does not own at the time of trade but has merely borrowed. The aim is to profit from a decline in the asset’s price by later buying the shares at a lower cost to cover the short position.
In October last year, Sebi had issued a broad framework on ‘Short-Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme’. The norms issued Friday are an addition to that framework.
ADVERTISEMENT
The new norms come two days after the Supreme Court rejected demands for a court-monitored probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a special investigation team (SIT) into allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud against the Adani Group by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in a January 2023 report.
The court also asked the Centre to probe “the loss which has been sustained by Indian investors as a result of the volatility caused by the short positions taken by Hindenburg Research and any other entities acting in concert with Hindenburg Research” and “enquire into whether there was any infraction of law by the entities, which engaged in short-selling on this occasion”.
“The institutional investors shall disclose upfront at the time of placement of order whether the transaction is a short-sale,” Sebi said in its framework for short-selling.
The market regulator mandated brokers to collect the details on scrip-wise short-sell positions, collate the data and upload it to the stock exchanges before the commencement of trading on the following trading day.
ADVERTISEMENT
The stock exchanges should then consolidate such information and disseminate the same on their websites for the information of the public on a weekly basis, it said.
In the framework issued in October, Sebi had allowed short-selling for all classes of investors, including retail and institutional. It has banned “naked short-selling” in the Indian securities market and asked all investors to mandatorily honour their obligation of delivering securities at the time of settlement.
Naked short-selling is when a trader sells shares in some asset without first borrowing them or ensuring they could be borrowed.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sebi has not allowed any institutional investor to engage in day trading — that is, square-off their transactions intraday. In other words, all transactions would be grossed for institutional investors at the custodians’ level and the institutions would be required to fulfil their obligations on a gross basis.
As per the framework, the securities traded in F&O (futures & options) and segments are eligible for short-selling and Sebi may review the list of stocks that are eligible for short-selling transactions from time to time.
Short-selling is a longstanding market practice that has often been the subject of considerable debate across the world. The votaries of short-selling consider it a desirable and an essential feature of a securities market. Critics say short-selling, directly or indirectly, can destabilise the market.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-institutional-investors-should-disclose-short-sell-transactions-upfront-9097116/,business
India registered strong investment performance in 2023; headwinds in China from struggling property sector: UN,"The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2024 report, launched on Thursday, said that investment has been more resilient in developing economies than in developed economies.","India registered strong investment performance in 2023, driven by government infrastructure projects and multinational investments, the United Nations has said while noting that investment prospects in China face “headwinds” from a struggling property sector.
The UN World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2024 report, launched here on Thursday, said that investment has been more resilient in developing economies than in developed economies. Investment in South Asia, particularly in India, remained strong in 2023.
“Investment prospects in China face headwinds from a struggling property sector, though government-led infrastructure investments are partially offsetting the shortfall in private investments. In contrast, India registered strong investment performance in 2023, driven by government infrastructure projects and multinational investments,” the report said.

Among the developing regions, Africa, Western Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean continue to struggle with high borrowing costs and other challenges that hinder investment growth. The report noted that India is benefiting from growing interest from multinationals, which see the country as a key alternative manufacturing base in the context of developed economies’ supply chain diversification strategies.
In 2022, FDI flows to India rose by 10 per cent to USD 49 billion, making it the third-largest host country for announced greenfield projects and the second-largest for international project finance deals.
The report added that another driver of fixed capital formation in the country is the increased government spending on roads, railways and renewable energy projects, which can have a crowd-in effect on private-sector investment.
According to Reserve Bank of India data, from April to September 2023, government capital expenditure in India increased by 43.1 per cent year-over-year. The report further said that slowing global demand, unresolved trade tensions between the largest trading partners and geopolitical conflicts are affecting trade flows in the short term. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia have also shaped global trade patterns.

“Crude oil exports from the Russian Federation, for example, have shifted from the European Union to China and India, which together accounted for close to 75 per cent of the country’s crude oil exports in the first quarter of 2023,” it said, citing data.
Russia’s economy is “increasingly feeling the negative impact of sanctions and declining export revenues. While the country has largely managed to evade the USD 60 per barrel oil price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries (by utilising a fleet of tankers not covered by traditional Western insurers), it has had to offer steep discounts on the sale of crude to major customers such as China and India,” the report said.
It added that tight financial conditions and fiscal and external imbalances will continue to weigh on growth in South Asia in the near term. In addition, geopolitical tensions – including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in Western Asia – will expose net-oil-importing countries in the region, including India, to the risk of sudden oil price spikes.

Further, as the region is highly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, the return of the El Nino climate phenomenon will also pose a significant risk to the economic outlook.
“Warmer-than-average temperatures will likely boost power demand and may also place a strain on local hydropower resources amid lower levels of precipitation, which could lead to power rationing constraining industrial activity, as has already been experienced by some South Asian countries in recent years,” it said.
The report highlighted that climate-change-related events continued to hurt the South Asian region in 2023.
Droughts intensified considerably during July and August, affecting most of India, Nepal and Bangladesh, while Pakistan recorded above-average rainfall.
In India, August was one of the driest months in four decades, impacting the production of key staple crops in the most affected areas. It said El Nino is expected to affect precipitation patterns in many Asian countries, causing extreme droughts or floods and consequently impacting agricultural output. These shocks are expected to be disproportionately severe in countries where agriculture accounts for the largest share of the GDP.
Damage to key agricultural crops will most likely lead to further increases in food prices, intensifying food insecurity pressures across the region, particularly in those countries already facing high levels of food insecurity, and undermining progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-investment-performance-china-property-sector-un-9096908/,business
"Brookfield arm acquires American Tower’s India unit for Rs 21,000 crore",This will be Brookfield’s third acquisition in the Indian telecommunications space.,"Data Infrastructure Trust (DIT), an Infrastructure Investment Trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, has signed an agreement with American Tower Corporation to acquire 100 per cent of the equity interests in American Tower’s mobile tower operations in India for Rs 21,000 crore ($2.5 billion).
Total cash proceeds include an enterprise value on the ATC India operations of approximately $2.0 billion, plus a ticking fee that accrues from October 1, 2023, to the date of closing. “Proceeds associated with the enterprise value assume the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the existing India term loan, by DIT,” ATC said in a statement.
Furthermore, and considered within the total potential cash proceeds above, American Tower will retain the full economic benefit associated with the optionally converted debentures (OCDs) issued by Vodafone Idea and will be entitled to receive future payments related to existing ATC India receivables. Proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used to repay American Tower’s existing indebtedness, it said.

“The transaction, which reflects the completion of the previously announced strategic review of American Tower’s operations in India, is subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second half of 2024,” the company said.
ATC India has around 78,000 mobile tower sites across India. This will be Brookfield’s third acquisition in the Indian telecommunications space. In 2022, Brookfield acquired a portfolio of 5,000 indoor business solution sites and small cell sites, which advances the rollout of 5G and enables telecom operators to extend their coverage capacity in difficult-to-access and dense areas.
Brookfield also has a portfolio of roughly 175,000 towers that were acquired in 2020 from Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited. ATC India will be included in DIT, which includes the existing telecommunications assets. The acquired sites are expected to diversify DIT’s revenues and increase touch points with all mobile network operators in India, it said.
Arpit Agrawal, Managing Director, Head of Infrastructure, India & Middle East, Brookfield, said, “We look forward to expanding and enhancing our existing telecom tower portfolio in India, which enables a broader array of solutions for our customers and partners. Through strategic acquisitions like ATC India, we remain deeply committed to empowering digital connectivity and transforming the telecom infrastructure landscape across the region.”

RBI revises definition of politically-exposed persons for KYC purpose,"The central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has changed the definition of Politically-Exposed Persons (PEPs) under its norms, a move that will make it easier for those individuals to carry out various banking transactions, including availing loans.
Certain changes have been made in the RBI’s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.
The earlier norms pertaining to PEPs were open-ended and there was a lack of clarity on the definition, apparently leading to issues for bankers, parliamentarians and others. There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts.

In the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as “individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials”. The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.
Bank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.
The central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.

"Govt to review PLI progress on Jan 12, no plan to widen scheme yet: DPIIT Secy","The review comes at a time when the department is aiming to make the scheme more efficient, and is learnt to be considering course correction for sectors where the scheme has not produced expected results.","The Union government is set to review the flagship production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme on January 12, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said Thursday.
The government is focusing on existing PLI schemes for 14 sectors and is not considering new PLIs, he said. The review comes at a time when the department is aiming to make the scheme more efficient, and is learnt to be considering course correction for sectors where the scheme has not produced expected results.
DPIIT, in a statement last month, said 746 applications have been approved till November 2023 and over Rs 95,000 crore in investment has come in till September 2023.

The government estimates that production or sales of Rs 7.80 lakh crore have taken place due to the scheme generating over 6.4 lakh jobs.
Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, in a social media post, had criticised the PLI scheme stating that job creation under the scheme is not commensurate with the investments made and that the government should release more data since lakhs of crores of public money has been pumped into the scheme.
“The PLI review will take place on the 12th. Currently we are focused on getting these 14 PLIs. All are up and running in a good way. So for the time being, the new PLIs are not being considered and we will focus on ensuring that these existing schemes get implemented well and thereafter we will see,” Singh said during a press briefing.
Singh also said the department is in the process of undertaking a third-party assessment of the PLI scheme in white goods (AC and LED lights).
“In all of them, the intent is to get real feedback on how these interventions have helped and what are the quantifiable outcomes that have come out,” Singh said.

The PLI scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors, such as telecommunication, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones, and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.

Tickets set to get cheaper as IndiGo withdraws fuel charge after fall in ATF prices,"The fuel charge, which was introduced by the airline in early October 2023, has been removed with effect from Thursday.","With jet fuel (ATF) prices falling from what they were over the past few months, India’s largest airline IndiGo has withdrawn fuel charges it had imposed on domestic and foreign routes.
The fuel charge, announced by IndiGo early October, was based on distance slabs and varied between Rs 300 and Rs 1,000 per sector.
“IndiGo, India’s leading airline, is pleased to announce the removal of fuel charge applicable on its on domestic and international routes, effective January 04, 2024. The fuel charge had been introduced in October 2023, following a surge in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices. With recent reduction in ATF prices, IndiGo is withdrawing the charge,” IndiGo said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
The airline added that considering the dynamic nature of ATF prices, it will continue to adjust fares “to respond to any change in prices or market conditions”.
The introduction of the fuel charge, which came at the onset of the peak festival travel season, followed four consecutive monthly hikes in jet fuel prices, taking them to their highest in 2023 by early October. ATF prices have since seen three consecutive reductions. Jet fuel prices have declined nearly 14 per cent since October.
“The decision follows the significant increase in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, which have surged in the last three months with consecutive price hikes every month. ATF accounts for a substantial portion of an airline’s operating expenses, necessitating fare adjustment to address such a cost surge. Under this pricing structure, passengers booking IndiGo flights will incur a fuel charge, per sector, based on the sector distance,” the carrier said in a statement,” IndiGo had said in October while announcing the charge.
ATF is a major cost for airlines and for Indian carriers, it accounts for over 40 per cent of their operational expenses. In India, ATF prices are deregulated and are set in line with global rates. Along with the decline in international cude oil prices, which had touched $97 per barrel in September, jet fuel prices have also cooled down in the international market.

At present, ATF is priced at Rs 1,01,993.17 per kilolitre (kl) in Delhi, as per information from the country’s largest fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation.

"December manufacturing PMI at 18-month low on slower pace of orders, output","Despite a loss of growth momentum, the manufacturing sector still expanded strongly in the month. There were softer, albeit sharp, increases in factory orders and output, while business confidence towards the year-ahead outlook strengthened, S&P Global said.","India’s manufacturing sector activity slowed to an 18-month low in December due to softening of output and new orders, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.
The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 54.9 last month from 56 in November. A PMI reading above 50 indicates an overall expansion in manufacturing activity compared to the previous month and a print below 50 shows an overall decrease.
Despite a loss of growth momentum, the manufacturing sector still expanded strongly in the month. There were softer, albeit sharp, increases in factory orders and output, while business confidence towards the year-ahead outlook strengthened, S&P Global said.

“India’s manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, although at a softer pace, following an uptick in the previous month. Growth of both output and new orders softened, but on the other hand, the future output index rose since November. Rates of increase in input and output prices were broadly unchanged,” said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC.
During the reporting month, new business gains, favourable market conditions, fairs and expositions collectively induced another sharp increase in manufacturing production.
However, the rate of expansion softened to the weakest since October 2022 even as it remained above its long-run average. Growth was reportedly curbed by fading demand for certain types of products, S&P Global said.
New orders placed with Indian manufacturers rose sharply but to a lesser extent in December. The pace of expansion was the slowest seen in a year-and-a-half.
ADVERTISEMENT
December data showed a twenty-first consecutive increase in international order receipts at goods producers in India. Companies noted gains from clients in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. New export sales expanded at a moderate pace that was the joint-slowest in eight months.
Goods producers signalled a further uptick in purchasing costs at the end of the 2023 calendar year. Among the items reported to have been up in price were chemicals, paper and textiles.
Little-changed from November, however, the rate of inflation was negligible by historical standards and was the second-weakest in just under three-and-a-half years, the survey said.

For the fourth month in a row, the rate of charge inflation surpassed that of input prices. Survey participants that hiked their fees in December mentioned the pass-through of recently absorbed cost burdens to clients, it said.
Employment was largely stable in December, with the respective seasonally adjusted index registering only fractionally above the 50 no-change mark.
In terms of stocks, the latest results showed a further increase in input holdings alongside another decline in inventories of finished products. The latter was attributed to the fulfilment of orders from warehoused items.

India Ratings raises FY24 GDP growth estimate to 6.7%,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global growth to slow down to 2.9 per cent in 2024 (2023: 3 per cent), lower than the pre-pandemic average growth of 3.8 per cent (2000-19).","India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has revised upwards India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for FY24 to 6.7 per cent from earlier 6.2 per cent, citing a number of factors including the resilience of the Indian economy, which grew 7.6 per cent in the second quarter of FY24.
According to Ind-Ra, the other factors that will boost the growth are: sustained government capex, deleveraged balance sheet of corporates/banking sector, the prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle, and sustained momentum in business and software services exports, coupled with remittances from the rest of the world despite global headwinds. However, it said there are risks to the global growth. The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects the world merchandise trade volume to have grown only 0.8 per cent as against the expected 1.7 per cent in 2023. However, WTO expects world merchandise trade volume to grow 3.3 per cent in 2024.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global growth to slow down to 2.9 per cent in 2024 (2023: 3 per cent), lower than the pre-pandemic average growth of 3.8 per cent (2000-19). While the IMF expects the growth decline in emerging markets and developing economies in 2023 to have been only 10 bps in 2023 at 4 per cent (2022:4.1 per cent), it has been sharper in advanced economies at 110 bps to 1.5 per cent (2.6 per cent), it said.

The IMF further expects the growth in advanced economies to slow down to 1.4 per cent in 2024 as the monetary policy tightening pursued by the central banks in these countries will continue to bite.
However, the tighter monetary policies would translate in to global inflation declining to 6.9 per cent in 2023 and 5.8 per cent in 2024 (2022: 8.7 per cent). Another risk that may impact the global growth and trade especially through disruptions in the supply chain is the volatile geopolitical situation — the Baltic Dry Index jumped to a six-quarter high of 2,079 in Q3FY24 from 1,194 in Q2FY24, it said.
“All these risks will continue to weigh on and restrict India’s GDP growth to 6.7 per cent in FY24 (FY23: 7.2 per cent). The quarterly GDP growth, which came in at 7.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent in Q1 of FY24 and Q2 of FY24 respectively, is slated to slow down sequentially in the remaining two quarters of FY24,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, Ind-Ra.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also expects a sequential slowdown in the GDP growth in the remaining two quarters and expects the overall FY24 GDP to come in at 7.0 per cent. The National Statistical Office is slated to release the first advance estimates for GDP for FY24 on Friday. The first advance estimates of GDP, obtained by extrapolation of data of the first seven-eight months of the ongoing financial year (FY24), are released early to help officers in the Ministry of Finance and other departments in framing the broad contours of Union Budget for the next financial year which is presented in Parliament on February 1.

Ind-Ra expects the private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to grow 5.2 per cent in FY24 (FY23: 7.5 per cent). The PFCE growth which increased to 6.0 per cent in Q1 of FY24, declined to 3.1 per cent in Q2 of FY24 (first half of FY24: 4.5 per cent).
However, PFCE growth in the second half of FY24 will benefit from the base effect (PFCE growth in H2 of FY23: 2.5 per cent). Therefore, Ind-Ra expects PFCE in 2HFY24 to grow 5.8 per cent.
It said wage growth is critical for consumption growth. Ind-Ra’s calculation shows that a 1 per cent increase in real wages could lead to a 1.12 per cent increase in the real PFCE and the multiplier effect of this could result in a 64 bps increase in the GDP growth. However, the data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket was marginally negative in Q2 of FY24, Ind-Ra said.
On the other hand, the real wage growth of households belonging to the upper income bracket grew 6.4 per cent in Q2 of FY24. As a result, the current consumption demand is skewed in favour of the goods and services consumed largely by the households belonging to the upper income bracket, it said.

Ind-Ra said sustained real wage growth of the households belonging to lower income bracket is an imperative for a sustainable and broad-based recovery in consumption demand.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-ratings-raises-fy24-gdp-growth-estimate-to-6-7-9094215/,business
"Danger of cheap goods invading Indian markets, says Jaishankar",India is trying to curb cheap quality imports from countries such as China with the use of several policy measures including quality control orders (QCOs).,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called for greater use of locally manufactured products by Indian consumers at a time when cheap and highly subsidized imported items are “invading” Indian markets.
India is trying to curb cheap quality imports from countries such as China with the use of several policy measures including quality control orders (QCOs). This comes as China continues to be India’s top import source with imports registering a 4 per cent jump to a record $98.51 billion in FY23. While India is dependent on imports of several items, most importantly, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), trade with China lacks transparency. China’s exports to India have risen consistently but India’s export to China faces multiple non-tariff barriers resulting in a sharp decline over the years.
“To me, particularly because there is a danger of cheap goods or subsidized goods invading our markets, we have to instill pride in the producer but also pride in the consumer. We must consciously say that we should make in India and buy in India and buy what is made in India,” Jaishankar said at the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Utsav celebration’ organised at Bharat Mandapam.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the importance of One District-One Product (ODOP), which aims to select, brand, and promote at least one product from each district, the minister said, “ODOP is part of our personality. This is very important because in the era of globalisation, various societies and cultures begin to lose their identity and personality”.
Meanwhile, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that India is not anti-imports.
“The idea is not to close our doors or that imports are bad. We are not anti-import. Atmanirbhar Bharat also means we will also increase our exports and for that if we need to import, we will not stop those. We will leave India’s impression on the cost, competition, and quality front,” Goyal said. In 2023, India’s goods imports far outstripped the exports. Moreover, exports declined amid slowing global demand in the backdrop of demand slowdown in the west and in China, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.
“Interestingly, this decrease in exports occurred despite a considerable depreciation in the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD). Over the span of one year, the average INR/USD exchange rate had depreciated from 77.5 in June 2022 to 82.1 in June 2023. Normally, a weaker domestic currency can boost exports by making a country’s products more competitive in the global market. However, in India’s case, the depreciation of the INR did not translate into increased export volumes,” the think tank said.

Notably, India’s efforts to push for local production and cut reliance on Chinese items has shown results in the electronic manufacturing sector.
The imports of finished electronic products like computers, laptops, and other hardware showed a decline, dropping from $15.4 billion to $13.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3 per cent. Imports of electronic instruments also reduced slightly from $10.4 billion to $10.1 billion, a 2.3 per cent decline.
These trends indicate the early successes of India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce dependency on imported electronics. The decrease in imports of finished products and instruments, alongside the growth in exports, especially in smartphones, suggests a strengthening of India’s electronics manufacturing capabilities, GTRI said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/danger-of-cheap-goods-invading-indian-markets-says-jaishankar-9094220/,business

"Oil markets in highly turbulent situation, says Minister Puri on petrol, diesel price cut","Three state-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, have kept petrol and diesel prices on freeze for a record 21 month in a row.","Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday responded to expectations of a reduction in petrol and diesel prices in view of softening international oil rates, by saying that global market is in a “highly turbulent” situation and it has to stabilise before any cut.
Three state-owned fuel retailers — Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, have kept petrol and diesel prices on freeze for a record 21 month in a row.
This is despite the raw material (crude oil) cost surging last year, leading to heavy losses in the first half of 2022-23 fiscal year before easing rates propelled them to profitability in the last three quarters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There has been no discussion with the oil marketing companies on any such issue,” Puri told reporters when asked if the government has held discussions with the three firms on a reduction in fuel prices. The oil companies, he said, make their own decisions of fuel pricing.
“We are in highly turbulent situation. There are two areas on the global map which are in conflict situation,” he said referring to the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict that has led to cargo ships being attacked in the Red Sea.
Puri said 12 per cent of the global shipping traffic, 18 per cent of oil and 4-8 per cent of LNG trade goes through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.
“God forbid, if there is further challenge or there is a disruption, you see an impact,” he said. International oil prices rebounded in the aftermath of the attack on ships in the Red Sea. The rates have however eased in subsequent days.
ADVERTISEMENT
“In a highly volatile situation, our primary responsibility is to ensure availability and affordability,” Puri said. “We are navigating this very carefully.” He said oil companies don’t ask the government about price revisions.
“Pray to god that there is no turbulence, things are normal,” he added. While at current prices, oil companies are making some money on petrol, and diesel — the most consumed fuel accounting for almost 40 per cent of all petroleum products consumed in the country — but it has been in a “touch-and-go” scenario in recent weeks. On some days there is profit on diesel but on other days there is loss. There is no consistent trend.

Three retailers had been recouping losses they incurred for holding rates when crude oil prices shot through the roof last year. In May, international oil prices and retail pump rates had come at par, but the subsequent surge widened the gulf between cost and price realised.
ADVERTISEMENT
For oil companies to reduce prices, oil prices will have to stabilise. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a freeze since April 6 last year. Petrol costs Rs 96.72 a litre in the national capital and diesel comes for Rs 89.62 per litre.
The three firms made bumper profits in April-September — the first half of the current fiscal — but considering the low earnings of last year, they are yet to recoup all losses, officials said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/oil-markets-minister-puri-petrol-diesel-price-cut-9094079/,business

India’s wheat output may touch new record of 114 million tonnes in 2023-24,"FCI's wheat procurement stood at 26.2 million tonnes, higher than the annual buffer requirement of 18.4 million tonnes.","Wheat production is expected to touch a new record of 114 million tonnes in the ongoing 2023-24 crop year on higher coverage and provided weather conditions remain normal, a top food ministry official said on Wednesday.
The last leg of sowing of wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, is underway and will continue till next week. Till last week, wheat was planted in 320.54 lakh hectares, as per the official data.
Wheat production stood at a record 110.55 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June), compared to 107.7 million tonnes achieved in the previous year.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We expect that total area under cultivation of wheat will increase this year and God willingly if the climate is alright, the production will be 114 million tonne that’s what the agriculture ministry has indicated informally to us,” Food Corporation of India (FCI) Chairman and Managing Director Ashok K Meena told reporters.
Area sown to wheat crop is also showing an increase compared to the last year. There was a deficit of one per cent in some states but that will also be made up in the first week of January, he said.
“If that is the level of production, we are very confident that we will be able to procure more than our requirement and also additional stocks needed for the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) for next year,” he noted.
When asked if the central nodal agency plans to step up procurement considering the opening wheat balance of 76 lakh tonnes to be on April 1, which is just enough to meet the buffer requirement, the FCI chief said: “We will try our best to provide minimum support price (MSP) to all farmers. Because of the open market sale, the indications are prices have stabilised and are not higher than it was last year. “Since the wheat MSP is higher by 7 per cent than the last year, we hope that lot of farmers will be willing to give their produce to the FCI,” Meena said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Last year, the FCI’s wheat procurement stood at 26.2 million tonnes, higher than the annual buffer requirement of 18.4 million tonnes. This year’s wheat crop will be ready for harvest from April onwards.
FCI is the central nodal agency that buys rice and wheat to ensure MSP to the farmers and distributes the grains for free to 81 crore poor via ration shops. It also uses surplus grain via OMSS to boost domestic availability and check prices.
Curbing wheat & rice inflation through OMSS:
According to FCI, 5.9 million tonnes of wheat has been sold in the open market through weekly e-auction under the OMSS since June 2023, which has helped stabilise the retail prices. “There has been hardly any increase in retail wheat prices on YoY basis,” the FCI Chairman said, adding that wheat OMSS will continue only till March 15.
ADVERTISEMENT
However in the case of rice, there is “of course an uptick in prices visible in the open market but the mere fact that we are making huge quantity of rice available through OMSS, I hope that the prices will also not increase substantially”, he said.
There has been a lukewarm response for rice under OMSS and so far the FCI has been able to sell only 1.45 lakh tonnes at Rs 29 per kg through weekly auctions. The FCI is using surplus foodgrain stock of 15.6 million tonnes for undertaking market intervention to stabilise the prices of two key commodities. “Our OMSS intervention has helped stabilise prices of these two commodities. Rice and wheat being important part of CPI basket, we would hope that food related inflation will get controlled to the maximum possible,” he added.
Launch of ‘Bharat rice’:
With a few takers for FCI rice under the OMSS, the FCI chief said there is a proposal under consideration to retail the grain under the ‘Bharat’ brand. The FCI has informed the food ministry that it has enough rice stock for the same. “The quantity and price at which Bharat rice to be sold is the decision of the ministry,” he said.
Sources said not much offtake of FCI rice for this new scheme is expected.
Status of this year’s rice procurement:
FCI has procured 31.1 million tonnes of rice so far in the ongoing 2023-24 marketing season (September-October), while the target set by state governments is 52.1 million tonnes.
ADVERTISEMENT
In terms of paddy, procurement was at 46.4 million tonnes so far this year, lower than 53.4 million tonnes in the year-ago period.
“One reason for lower procurement is that the paddy prices in the open market are also very high. The other reason is the pace of procurement was slow in states like Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh due to assembly elections,” he said. However, the procurement is likely to pick up going forward when the states are about to announce bonus to farmers, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
In West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, paddy procurement is sluggish as open market prices this year remain high, he added. The FCI chief further said there is “no cause of concern about the availability of rice for buffer” because the quantity of rice procured so far is good enough to meet the requirement of welfare schemes. “The annual requirement of the rice for maintaining a buffer to meet all welfare scheme is 40-41 million tonnes. I am well on course to meet the requirement,” the FCI chief said.
In the 2022-23 marketing season, the FCI had purchased 56.9 million tonnes of rice.
According to the FCI, total foodgrain stock was at 34.4 million tonnes as on January 1. About 32.8 million tonnes of rice is being milled, which will take the total central pool stock to 67.2 million tonnes.

On funds required for undertaking procurement, the FCI chief said, “Till now, the flow of funds under food subsidy is extremely comfortable. Right now, there is zero short-term loan with FCI.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/indias-wheat-output-new-record-114-million-tonnes-2023-24-9093875/,business

Higher borrowing by states to widen yield spread with G-sec,States’ borrowing seen at record Rs 4.13 lakh crore in Q4,"As six states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan and Bihar — tapped the market on Tuesday for borrowing Rs 16,000 crore in the first weekly auction for January-March, the spread between the yields on state development loans (SDL) and the Centre’s G-sec (government securities) widened to over 50 basis points (bps). With states anticipating higher expenditure and having proposed record borrowing of Rs 4.13 lakh crore in the January-March quarter (Q4), the yield spread between the 10-year state governments’ loans and the benchmark 10-year G-sec is expected to widen further amid concerns of higher supply of dated securities, experts said.
“The Q4 FY24 SDL calendar implies that there will be a significant supply of duration, when seen in conjunction with G-sec supply…the gross supply from states and Centre is likely to be concentrated in the 15-year to 50-year segment, at around 35% of total Q4 FY24 supply. This is likely to result in steepening of the curve. Moreover, the large supply for states will further widen the spreads between SDLs and G-sec,” Gaura Sen Gupta, Economist, IDFC First Bank said.

India’s domestic air passenger traffic at record high in 2023,"Last year was the first full year since the outbreak of the pandemic, which brought the aviation industry to its knees globally.","India’s domestic air passenger traffic hit a record high in 2023, dwarfing the pre-pandemic peaks and marking the sector’s full recovery from Covid-19’s impact.

India is chasing China’s economy.

India’s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6% this year — faster than the United States or China.
But there’s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India’s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India’s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining.

Akasa is India’s newest airline and has garnered market share of 4% since it started flying in 2022, against IndiGo’s 60% and Tata Group airlines’ combined 26%.
Its Chief Commercial Officer Praveen Iyer told Indian newspaper Business Line in December that Akasa planned to announce a three-digit aircraft order in early 2024, without sharing any details.
The first source said its new order for around 150 planes is likely to include some future purchasing options.

The airline currently flies only domestically, with a fleet of around two dozen planes. It was hit last year by the abrupt departure of about a tenth of its pilots and had warned it was flying less as a result, costing it market share. It has since said the issue is behind it.
Both sources said Akasa’s new plane order is aimed at fuelling its domestic and international expansion, with the narrowbody Boeing planes being ordered equipped to fly to nearby foreign destinations like Southeast Asia and the Middle East from India.
Indian carriers are trying to keep pace with soaring demand for air travel which has surged post-COVID, sending industry records tumbling amid diminishing production slots even as plane manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals.

IndiGo in June placed a record order for 500 Airbus narrowbody planes, eclipsing Air India’s purchase of 470 combined jets from Airbus and Boeing earlier in the year.
Akasa’s order will be another win for Boeing, which has been lagging behind Airbus in the fast-growing Indian market, where its other customers include SpiceJet.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/indias-akasa-air-order-boeing-jets-report-9092418/,business

“We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on weak domestic equities and a rise in the US dollar. Surge in crude oil prices may also weigh on the domestic currency. However, any FII outflows may support rupee at lower levels,” Choudhary added.
Choudhary further noted that traders may take cues from final manufacturing PMI and construction spending data from the US. “Traders may await manufacturing index data from India and ISM manufacturing PMI and JOLTS jobs data from the US tomorrow.

No longer looking at import duties as revenue source in FTA negotiations: Official,This comes amid internal consultations between the finance ministry and the commerce ministry to assess the impact of the major duty reductions that could be announced as part of the FTAs.,"India is likely to lower tariffs on a range of items including high tariff products such as cars, whiskey and machinery items for the first time under the free trade agreements (FTAs) with developed economies and is moving away from looking at tariffs as a source of revenue during negotiations, a government official said.
This comes amid internal consultations between the finance ministry and the commerce ministry to assess the impact of the major duty reductions that could be announced as part of the FTAs. India is currently negotiating FTAs with the UK, the European Union(EU), Australia and Oman, and India could lower duties on goods and services sharply.

"Houthi threat notwithstanding, it’s smooth sailing for Russian oil through Red Sea","According to the United States (US) Energy Information Administration (EIA), southbound shipments through the Suez Canal rose significantly between 2021 and 2023, largely because of Western sanctions on Russia’s oil exports.","The recent spate of attacks on commercial vessels by Yemen-based Houthi rebels have not impacted flow of Russian crude through the Suez Canal-Red Sea route, even as a number of global shipping lines and oil companies are now avoiding the important global trade artery. Tankers carrying Russian crude have not rerouted, and even the fresh cargoes leaving Russian ports are sticking to the Red Sea route to reach Asia, instead of going all the way around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, as per data from commodity market analytics firm Kpler.
Russian oil cargoes departing from the North Sea and Black Sea ports take the Suez Canal-Red Sea route to reach Asia, specifically India and China, which are currently the biggest buyers of Russian crude. Oil and shipping analysts do not foresee tankers carrying Russian oil coming under attack in the region as Russia is perceived as Iran’s ally. The Houthi rebels are widely believed to be backed by Tehran.

"High tariffs among reasons behind weak exports, says GTRI","The tariff discrepancy was among the factors why India's three key Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN, South Korea, and Japan were not successful as per the think tank which resulted in India's merchandise trade deficit with these partners increased significantly more than its global trade deficit.","The reasons behind India’s weaker export performance include higher tariffs in India and lower tariffs in its FTA partner countries, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said in a report on Monday.
“Many Indian firms choose not to use the FTA route when import duties are low, as FTA-related compliance costs do not justify the tariff benefits. For instance, in the case of India’s FTA partners, many imports occur at zero or low Most Favored Nation (MFN) duties,” the report said.

Gross GST collections drop to three-month low of Rs 1.64 lakh crore in December,"In December, the government settled Rs 40,057 crore to Central GST and Rs 33,652 crore to State GST from Integrated GST. As a result, the total revenue for the month post settlement was Rs 70,501 crore for the Centre and Rs 71,587 crore for State GST.","The Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections declined to a three-month low of Rs 1.64 lakh crore in December (for sales in November), data released by the Finance Ministry on Monday showed. Though year-on-year growth of 10.3 per cent was registered in December, the pace of growth in GST collections was also the slowest in three months.
Earlier, a pickup in consumption and economic activity along with settlement of disputes by businesses following notices issued by GST authorities were seen to have contributed to the sharp rise in GST revenue, which has now moderated despite early-November having marked the festival season. The impact of lower imports is likely to have contributed to the decline in GST revenues. GST collections had surged 15.1 per cent to Rs 1.67 lakh crore in November and 13.4 per cent in October at Rs 1.72 lakh crore, the second-highest level since the July 2017 rollout of the indirect tax regime.

Boeing asks airlines to inspect 737 Max jets for potential loose bolt,Boeing's 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people.,"Boeing is asking airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system, the airplane maker and Federal Aviation Administration confirmed this week.
The FAA said it would be “closely monitoring” the targeted inspections. The agency said Thursday that Boeing issued its inspection guidance to airlines after an international operator found a bolt with a missing nut during routine maintenance. In a separate case, Boeing also discovered an undelivered aircraft that had a nut that was not properly tightened.
“The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,” the Arlington, Virginia, company told The Associated Press on Friday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 MAX airplanes and inform us of any findings.”

Boeing added that it will continue to update both customers and federal regulators on the progress.

The FAA said it will remain in contact with Boeing and impacted airlines as the inspections are performed, and potentially “consider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware.”
According to Boeing, there have been no in-flight incidents caused by this condition to date — noting that crews’ routine checks would signal if the rudder was not working properly before an aircraft pushes back from the gate.
The company added that all airplanes Boeing is set to deliver onward will have the inspection (which is estimated to take about two hours per plane) prior to delivery.

US carriers with 737 Max jets in their fleet include United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. All four of these carriers told The Associated Press Friday that they don’t expect operational impacts. Southwest, for example, said it was currently performing all of these inspections during routine overnight maintenance.
A firm timeline for the inspections wasn’t provided for each airline, but Alaska said it expected to complete the process by the first half of January.
Boeing’s 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people. Investigations focused on an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty sensor readings. Boeing did not tell pilots and airlines about the system until after the first crash.

The FAA, which also faced criticism for the way it approved the Max jets prior to these deadly crashes, has since moved to provide a more-detailed certification process for large planes and required safety disclosures.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/boeing-airlines-737-max-jets-inspection-loose-bolt-9089336/,business

Expect to ‘comfortably’ achieve over 6.5% growth for FY24 on sustained momentum in economy: FinMin,"On the inflation front, the DEA said that the headline inflation outlook is on a “declining trend”, given the stable downward movement in core inflation and continuing deflation in fuel inflation, notwithstanding the temporary disruptions from high food prices.","The growth momentum witnessed by the Indian economy in the July-September quarter is likely to continue in October-December and even in January-March, and it is expected to “comfortably” achieve a growth rate of over 6.5 per cent for 2023-24 (FY24), the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) said in its half-yearly economic review for FY24. According to the DEA, the Indian economy’s high frequency indicators (HFIs) for October and November demonstrate robust economic activity and the trend is expected to continue through the fourth quarter as well.
Although the DEA cautioned against downside risks emanating from “smouldering inflationary pressures” in advanced economies and re-emerging supply chain disruptions due to persistent geopolitical stress, it sees domestic economic momentum, low-to-moderate input cost pressures, and anticipated policy continuity as “significant” buffers against them.

He said that the committee getting a wider mandate does not mean that “the committee is there to look into each agri product and start recommending MEP for that”.

Banks need to lower dependence on bulk deposits: RBI deputy Guv Swaminathan J,"Even when interest rates decline, long-term large deposits will still have to be managed and that can lead to lower margins eating up profit, Reserve Bank deputy governor Swaminathan J said.","Banks should lower their dependence on bulk deposits, which are typically of higher tenor and better-priced than retail liabilities, if they want to protect their margins and profitability especially in a higher interest rates regime, Reserve Bank deputy governor Swaminathan J said on Thursday.
Addressing a banking and economic conclave organised by State Bank of India here, he flagged the rising tendency of banks to depend on bulk deposits and urged them to effectively manage interest rate risks, else they will have a tough time when lending rates fall but bulk deposit rates continue to remain high.
Even when interest rates decline, these long-term large deposits will still have to be managed and that can lead to lower margins eating up profit, he said.

“On the liabilities side, banks must endeavour to proactively manage the pricing and duration of their deposits while trying to diversify the sources and optimising the product mix of deposits. Excessive reliance on bulk deposits should be avoided as these are more sensitive to interest rate movements and perpetuate concentration risk while also eroding earnings,” Swaminathan said.
Warning that bankers should not feel complacent with the presently high net interest margins, he said the higher Net interest margin (NIMs) that they enjoy now may not be sustained in the future when the interest rate cycle reverses. He said compared to the past five years, the banking sector stands tall today, reflecting its strength and viability.
As of September 2023, the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of banks stood at an impressively high 16.79 per cent. On the other hand the asset quality is at over a decadal high with gross non-performing assets falling to a low 3.25 per cent and net non performing assets (NPAs) at 0.76 per cent.
Banks need to remain alert to the risks inherent in their business models and mitigate them in a timely manner. In good times, financial institutions must review their growth plans while putting in place adequate risk management systems to handle the emerging risks, he said. It is imperative that their boards are free to fix suitable sectoral and sub-sectoral exposure limits and monitor them closely to avoid any sectoral concentration, adverse selection or dilution of underwriting standards.
ADVERTISEMENT
Stressing on the need to have a robust IT infrastructure, he said it has become imperative for banks and payment system participants to ensure uninterrupted availability of various online and mobile banking channels at all times and pointed to the recent incidents of unscheduled downtimes inconveniencing several customers.
Flagging lower IT spends he said, it has also been observed that many banks have not been spending fully the budget earmarked for procurement of IT systems and IT security systems. He also stressed on the need for banks and other ecosystem participants to have robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place and test them periodically.
Noting the growing collaboration between banks, NBFCs, and fintechs which is driving innovation in products, services, and business models, he said, while such collaboration is good, banks and other financial institutions should be cautious in lending through analytics.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Banks and NBFCs should exercise caution in relying solely on preset algorithms, ensuring that these models are robust, regularly tested, and recalibrated as needed to maintain robust underwriting standards,” he said.
He also warned lenders against outsourcing risks to third parties. “… it is crucial to be vigilant on the accompanying risks which include the potential loss of control over critical operations, risk of data security breaches, heightened dependency on third-party providers, and the possibility of reputation damage stemming from the misconduct of service providers,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banks-bulk-deposits-rbi-deputy-guv-swaminathan-j-9086634/,business
"Reliance will never be complacent, will be in world’s top 10 conglomerates, says Ambani","Mukesh Ambani said as India races ahead to become the world's third largest economy (from being fifth largest), an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance.","Having created businesses ranging from world’s largest single-location oil refining complex to nation’s largest mobile network operators in just few years, billionaire Mukesh Ambani says his group Reliance Industries Ltd will never be complacent and will grow to be among the top 10 business conglomerates of the world.
Addressing employees on Reliance Family Day – the birthday of the group’s founder Dhirubhai Ambani, he said Reliance is now aiming to consolidate a place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption.
“Today, the domestic and global environments for business are changing very fast. There is simply no room for complacency,” he said. “Reliance was never complacent in the past, and Reliance will never be complacent in future.” Reliance, he said, is known for “disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention”.
ADVERTISEMENT
Starting with a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai, Reliance did backward integration — it ventured into petrochemicals (which provide feedstock for textiles) and became the nation’s largest producer. It then set up an oil refinery — the largest in the country and expanded it to being the world’s biggest single-location oil refining complex.
In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world.
Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services. “We have shown the courage to set the bar high, and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance, said.
He said as India races ahead to become the world’s third largest economy (from being fifth largest), an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. “Reliance can and Reliance will grow to be among the top 10 business conglomerates of the world,” he said without setting any timelines.

Reliance is India’s largest corporation by revenues, profits and market value. For this, he asked employees to be ‘laser-focused’ on always providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. “In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,” he said.
At the same time, the company’s actions must always win community trust. Also, it must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities. “When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India’s inclusive prosperity, and make the world a better place,” he said.
Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are — consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure place among global leaders in institutional culture.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.
“In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.
All growth engines of Reliance — digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences — will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said.
“Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India’s urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,” he said.
In order to make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to further build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation. “We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance’s culture is to work with the founder’s mindset. “It means working with the ownership mindset.” “Each and everyone of you becomes an owner of Reliance when you own the founder’s purpose and passion,” he told employees. “Young leaders will commit mistakes. That’s for sure.
“But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.” Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young, by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s.

“Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,” he said referring to his three children.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/reliance-worlds-top-10-conglomerates-mukesh-ambani-9086579/,business

The trajectory is being helped by the low crude oil prices, keeping inflation in check with a big positive on raw material cost.

Zomato gets Rs 401.7 crore GST liability notice,"""The amount alleged in the SCN is based on the amounts collected by the company as delivery charges from the customers on behalf of the delivery partners during the referred period,"" it said.","Online food delivery firm Zomato Ltd has been served a Rs 401.7 crore GST liability show cause notice over delivery charges, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Zomato, however, asserted that it is not liable to pay the amount, as delivery charge is collected by it on behalf of delivery partners.
The company has received a Show Cause Notice (SCN) on December 26, 2023 under Section 74(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Pune Zonal Unit, it said in a regulatory filing.

The SCN requires the company to show cause as to why an alleged tax liability of Rs 401.7 crore, along with interest and penalty, for the period from October 29, 2019 to March 31, 2022 should not be demanded from it.
“The amount alleged in the SCN is based on the amounts collected by the company as delivery charges from the customers on behalf of the delivery partners during the referred period,” it said.
Zomato asserted that it “strongly believes that it is not liable to pay any tax since the delivery charge is collected by the company on behalf of the delivery partners.” “Further, in view of the contractual terms and conditions mutually agreed upon, the delivery partners have provided the delivery services to the customers and not the company.

Mutual Funds: Understanding Tax saving Funds and How SIP and Lumpsum Routes Differ,"When it comes to tax-saving funds, the choice between SIP and lumpsum routes holds significant implications for investors. Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform not only provides a diverse range of tax saving mutual funds but also introduces innovative tools like the lumpsum calculator.","Tax saving mutual funds have become an integral part of the financial strategy in 2023. This is not just for financial growth but also for optimising tax liabilities. As we delve into the intricacies of these funds, the choice between the SIP (systematic investment plan) and lumpsum routes emerges as a crucial decision for investors. 
This article navigates through the features of tax saving mutual funds (equity linked saving schemes), exploring the distinctions between SIP and lumpsum investment options, and introducing the innovative lumpsum calculator to empower investors in making informed decisions.
Understanding tax saving mutual funds:
Why tax saving mutual funds?
Tax saving mutual funds, also known as equity linked saving schemes (ELSS), present a unique opportunity for investors to not only build wealth but also enjoy tax benefits. With a mandatory lock-in period of three years, these funds offer tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, making them an attractive avenue for those looking to optimise tax outflows while participating in the potential growth of the equity market.
The SIP advantage
ADVERTISEMENT
Systematic investment plans (SIPs) within tax saving mutual funds provide a disciplined and systematic approach to investing. With SIPs, investors contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals, navigating market volatility effectively. This strategy utilises the power of rupee cost averaging, allowing investors to buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. Over time, this approach minimises the impact of market fluctuations on the overall investment.
The lumpsum appeal
On the flip side, the lumpsum route involves a one-time investment in tax saving mutual funds. While it lacks the periodicity of SIPs, lumpsum investments offer the potential for significant gains if timed well. Investors with a lumpsum amount, whether from a bonus, inheritance, or other windfalls, can capitalise on market opportunities by deploying a substantial amount in one go.
Divergence in approaches: SIP vs. lumpsum
Risk management
SIPs provide a risk mitigation mechanism through rupee cost averaging, ensuring that market volatility works in favour of the investor. In contrast, lumpsum investments are more susceptible to immediate market fluctuations, potentially exposing investors to higher short-term risks.
Market timing
SIPs offer a strategic advantage by eliminating the need for precise market timing. Investors contribute regularly, benefiting from market fluctuations over time. Lumpsum investments, on the other hand, require careful consideration of market conditions for optimal entry, making timing a critical factor in maximising returns.
Psychological comfort
ADVERTISEMENT
SIPs provide psychological comfort by removing the pressure of timing the market perfectly. Investors contribute consistently, irrespective of short-term market movements, fostering a disciplined and stress-free investment approach. Lumpsum investments may induce psychological stress as investors face the challenge of deciding the opportune moment for a significant one-time investment.
Introducing the lumpsum calculator from Bajaj Finserv
Why a lumpsum calculator?
In the pursuit of informed investment decisions, Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform introduces the lumpsum calculator. This innovative tool is designed to empower investors with a projection of their lumpsum investments potential growth. By inputting key variables such as the investment amount, expected rate of return, and investment tenure, investors gain valuable insights into the future value of their lumpsum investments.
How to use the lumpsum calculator?
Utilising the Bajaj Finserv lumpsum calculator is straightforward. Investors input the lumpsum amount they plan to invest, the expected rate of return, and the investment tenure. The calculator then generates a detailed projection, illustrating the potential future value of the investment over the specified period. This foresight enables investors to align their lumpsum investments with their financial goals.
Benefits of the lumpsum calculator
ADVERTISEMENT
The Bajaj Finserv lumpsum calculator offers several advantages for investors:
Strategic planning: Investors can strategically plan their lumpsum investments by adjusting variables like the investment amount and tenure to align with specific financial goals.
Risk assessment: By providing a projection, the calculator aids in assessing the potential risks and rewards associated with lumpsum investments, helping investors make well-informed decisions.
Goal alignment: The calculator facilitates goal-oriented investing by illustrating how lumpsum investments can contribute to specific financial objectives, whether it is buying a home, funding education, or planning for retirement.
Conclusion
When it comes to tax-saving funds, the choice between SIP and lumpsum routes holds significant implications for investors. Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform not only provides a diverse range of tax saving mutual funds but also introduces innovative tools like the lumpsum calculator. Whether you opt for the disciplined approach of SIPs or the potential gains of lumpsum investments, Bajaj Finserv mutual funds ensures a seamless and rewarding investment journey. Explore the possibilities, leverage the lumpsum calculator, and embark on a path to maximise your wealth through tax saving mutual funds.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sponsored-business/mutual-funds-understanding-tax-saving-funds-and-how-sip-and-lumpsum-routes-differ-9086037/,business

"Russian oil import at 8-month low in October as discount falls, OPEC share up","According to an analysis of India’s official trade data by The Indian Express, Russia’s share in India’s oil imports (by volume) in October was 31.9 per cent, down from 34.8 per cent in September.","With discounts on Russian crude oil shrinking, Moscow’s share in India’s oil imports declined to an eight-month low in October, while New Delhi’s traditional West Asian suppliers — Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — managed to claw back part of the market share they had ceded to Russia.
According to an analysis of India’s official trade data by The Indian Express, Russia’s share in India’s oil imports (by volume) in October was 31.9 per cent, down from 34.8 per cent in September. It declined for four consecutive months from the peak of 44.7 per cent registered in June.
On the other hand, the combined share of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE touched a seven-month high of 44.1 per cent in October, having risen consistently month-over-month since June. Higher supply of crude from these three countries over the past few months has been leading the recovery in the share of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in India’s oil imports.

In October, OPEC’s share in India’s oil import volumes was 50.2 per cent, up from 49.1 per cent in September. In April 2022, when Russian oil deliveries to India were starting to rise notably, the international oil suppliers’ cartel accounted for a 71.3 per cent share, led by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which together had a share of nearly 61 per cent in New Delhi’s oil imports. Apart from these three countries, OPEC has 10 other member nations.
The government releases country-wise and commodity-wise trade data with a lag; the data till October is available so far.
While the price of crude oil depends on grades and can vary substantially, the average landed price of crude and import volumes from the supplying countries were used for computations as the government does not release grade-wise oil import data.
Prior to the war in Ukraine, Iraq was India’s top source of crude, followed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while Russia was a marginal player. However, as the West began shunning Russian oil following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia started offering deep discounts to willing buyers. Indian refiners started lapping up the discounted barrels, catapulting Russia to the top spot on the list of India’s oil suppliers. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have each slipped a rank on the list.

Over the past few months, industry insiders have been saying that the discounts on Russian oil have eroded significantly due to a number of factors, including high oil price volatility, high and opaque shipping and insurance charges, competition from Chinese refiners, export cuts by Russia and the country’s own domestic demand for petroleum products, the evidently loose enforcement of the West’s price cap on Russian oil and Moscow finding ways to bypass the restrictions.
According to The Indian Express’s analysis of trade data, the discount on the delivered price – including freight and insurance – of Russian crude with respect to the average delivered price of oil from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE was just 5.7 per cent in October, after falling for four consecutive months from June’s peak level of 22.7 per cent. Similarly, the discount on Russian oil with respect to the average price of oil received from all OPEC suppliers fell for four consecutive months to 6.9 per cent in October from 23.1 per cent in June.
Even as the discounts on Russian oil vis-à-vis other major suppliers have visibly shrunk, for India, which depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its oil requirement, even lower concessions matter as they help the country save billions of dollars in foreign exchange.
ADVERTISEMENT
As reported earlier by The Indian Express, Indian refiners are estimated to have saved around $3.3 billion in the first half of the current financial year (FY24) through purchase of discounted Russian crude oil, according to computations based on trade data. For April-November, the savings are estimated to have risen to $3.55 billion.
Since Indian refiners started ramping up Russian oil imports, the actual discount levels remain shrouded in mystery, due to the opaque pricing of Russian oil cargoes. Unlike oil from most other suppliers, Russian crude is being bought by Indian refiners on a delivered basis, which means the price of the cargoes includes cost of freight and insurance, apart from the cost of oil itself. Therefore, the best available marker for discounts is a comparison between the average landed price of Russian crude and the average price of oil imported from other suppliers.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/russian-oil-import-at-8-month-low-in-oct-as-discount-falls-opec-share-up-9084032/,business

"India’s Russian crude imports prevented price surge, ‘havoc’ in global oil market, says petroleum ministry",India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement.,"Global crude oil prices would have surged and created “havoc” in the international oil market had India not ramped up oil imports from Russia in the aftermath of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the petroleum and natural gas ministry told the department-related parliamentary standing committee.
“If they (Indian refiners) had not imported Russian oil into India, which may be a big number of 1.95 million barrels per day, that deficiency would have created a havoc in the crude oil market and the prices would have shot up by about $30-40,” a petroleum ministry representative was quoted as saying in a recent report of the standing committee on petroleum and natural gas. The report was tabled in Parliament on December 20.

Regulatory mismatch in services sector challenge for India-UK FTA: Official,"On the issue of movement of professionals, the official said that immigration debate and the ongoing FTA discussions in services are completely different things.","Lack of regulatory alignment with global standards in the service sector and resistance to foreign competition are among the chief deterrents in India’s efforts to strike deals with global services leaders such as the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK) that could boost services jobs in the country, a government official told The Indian Express.
However, India is on the “same page” with free trade agreement (FTA) partners on movement of business professionals as there is a strong demand for Indian professionals in the UK and European businesses too, the official said, adding that India needs business mobility for smooth movement of goods and services and “nobody is disputing it”. Trade deals in the service sector assumes significance as India’s service sector contributes over 50 per cent to the gross domestic product but the growth has not been inclusive as the sector absorbs less than a third of the Indian workforce largely due to outdated regulations and barriers on foreign direct investment (FDI).

No takers for rupee payment for oil imports,The default payment currency for all contracts for import of crude oil is US dollar as per the international trade practice.,"India’s push for rupee to be used to pay for import of crude oil has not found any takers as suppliers have expressed concern on repatriation of funds and high transactional costs, the oil ministry told a parliamentary standing committee.
The default payment currency for all contracts for import of crude oil is US dollar as per the international trade practice. However, in a bid to internationalise the Indian currency, the Reserve Bank of India on July 11, 2022 allowed importers to pay with rupees and exporters be paid in rupee.
While there has been some success with non-oil trade with a select few countries, rupee continues to be shunned by oil exporters.

“During FY 2022-23, no crude oil imports by oil PSUs was settled in Indian rupee. Crude oil suppliers (including UAE’s ADNOC) continue to express their concern on the repatriation of funds in the preferred currency and also highlighted high transactional costs associated with conversion of funds along with exchange fluctuation risks,” the oil ministry told the parliamentary department related standing committee.
The ministry, whose subimissions are part of the committee’s report which was tabled in Parliament last week, said Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has informed that it incurred high transaction costs as crude oil suppliers pass on the additional transactional costs to IOC.” The RBI, it said, had last year permitted opening of rupee vostro accounts in the partner trading country. Under this mechanism, Indian importers undertaking imports through this mechanism shall make payment in Indian rupee which shall be credited into the special Vostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier.
“Payments for crude oil can be made in Indian rupee, subject to the suppliers’ complying with regulatory guidelines in this regard,” the ministry said. “Currently, Reliance Industries Ltd and oil PSUs do not have an agreement with any crude oil supplier to make purchases in Indian currency for supply of crude oil.” India is the world’s third largest energy consumer. With its domestic production meeting less than 15 per cent of its needs, the country imports the remaining crude oil, which is converted to fuels such as petrol and diesel at refineries.
In the 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal, India spent USD 157.5 billion on import of 232.7 million tonnes of crude oil. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and UAE were its biggest suppliers. Of this, 141.2 million tonnes came from the Middle East, accounting for 58 per cent of all supplies.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the current fiscal, India imported 152.6 million tonnes of crude oil between April and November for USD 113.4 billion.
“India’s consumption would be about 5.5-5.6 million barrels per day. Out of that, we import about 4.6 million barrels per day, which is about 10 per cent of the overall oil trade in the world,” the ministry told the committee.
On price volatility, the ministry said PSU oil firms are impacted by the volatility in prices of crude oil but only to the extent of fuel and loss.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The prices of crude oil and refined petroleum products generally move in tandem with each other. Thus, it’s the volatility in product cracks (price difference between that of product prices and benchmark crude oil), which impacts the refiners the most.” “To hedge against this volatility, oil companies has been hedging the various product cracks as and when the opportunity is presented in the forward market. All the hedge positions are undertaken through OTC (Over the Counter) market with registered international counterparties and details of the hedge is reported to authorised dealer bank on quarterly basis. Further, oil companies are also hedging their forex risk in line with their risk management policies,” it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/no-takers-for-rupee-payment-for-oil-imports-9080960/,business

‘Export of basmati rice could be affected by Red Sea attacks’,"The alternative route may also affect India’s exports of the long-grain rice to Egypt and European countries, said the official, requesting anonymity.","The rerouting by major shipping lines in an effort to avoid the Red Sea route, which has seen multiple attacks on vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, could raise the price of Indian basmati rice exports by 15 to 20 per cent, a senior official with a government agency said.

Insurance for all: Finance Ministry pushes for health regulator,"In recent discussions between the Department of Financial Services and insurance players, it was brought up that insurance penetration needs rapid scaling up to achieve “insurance for all”.","The Finance Ministry has called for discussions to set up a healthcare sector regulator to organise, standardise and regulate hospitals under the insurance programme, The Indian Express has learnt.
In recent discussions between the Department of Financial Services and insurance players, it was brought up that insurance penetration needs rapid scaling up to achieve “insurance for all”.
“In the case of health insurance, there appears to be a need for establishing a Health Regulator for achieving this goal,” said DFS Secretary Vivek Joshi in a letter to the Department of Health and Family Welfare, it is learnt.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The ongoing efforts of the National Health Authority of building the National Health Exchange (NHA) have been welcomed by the insurance industry. A Health Regulator would play a vital role in ensuring that this digital transformation aligns with the efficiency of the providers’ ecosystem,” Joshi is learnt to have said in the letter to Sudhansh Pant, Secretary (H&FW), Department of Health and Family Welfare.
“I request you to initiate a meeting of the General Insurance Council — the apex body of all general insurance companies — along with the senior executives of leading insurance companies, National Health Authority and Department of Financial Services to explore the possibility of setting up a Health Regulator so that health insurance can be made more affordable and ubiquitous,” Joshi is learnt to have written.
Earlier, a joint working group of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and National Health Authority proposed a common hospital registry, empanelment process, grading of hospitals and package cost harmonisation to promote the standardisation and effective utilisation of health infrastructure under the insurance programme.
Insurance companies and hospitals follow different yardsticks for health insurance and there’s no uniformity in the cost structure. Over 40 crore people still don’t have health insurance coverage.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to industry observers, though there is an urgent need for a health regulator to supervise and regulate Indian hospitals along with other issues, the government can’t by itself establish one like the Reserve Bank of India, SEBI or IRDAI. Health, for legislative purposes, is a State subject.
“It will require moving healthcare to Concurrent List from the State List and would involve some Parliamentary procedures,” an industry expert said. Indian insurers in the health insurance business want a health regulator to ensure an orderly functioning of hospitals which play a key role in servicing a health policy.
There is a constant tussle between hospitals and insurers on many issues particularly on arbitrary charges, which inflate claims and push up premiums.
ADVERTISEMENT
IRDAI had earlier said either they should be allowed to regulate hospitals or a separate regulator should be instituted. It is necessary to regulate hospitals to protect the public against continuous increase in health insurance premiums, officials said.
IRDAI had said that as an insurance regulator, it is only regulating only one portion of the health services sector — only the insurers and TPAs (third party administrators) — but on the other end, there are hospitals that are not regulated.
Meanwhile, insurers, prodded by IRDAI, are preparing to implement changes paving the way for a 100 per cent cashless payment arrangement in the health insurance segment which needs a robust technological platform and a deeper coordination with all the stakeholders of the nationwide healthcare sector involving hospitals, doctors and pharmacists.
The new system of cashless payment, apart from needing a technological platform, also needs a lot of standardisation of rates, services and empanelment of more hospitals to cover every nook and corner of the country. Insurers say this can’t happen without a health regulator.
After the pandemic, the health insurance sector is growing at a much faster clip and has emerged as the largest portfolio in the industry. Health portfolio of the industry grew 23 per cent to Rs 90,667 crore, contributing almost 35 per cent (33 per cent in FY 22) of the industry’s premium kitty in FY 23.
ADVERTISEMENT
Currently, healthcare schemes and private insurance have individual hospital empanelment processes, which replicate various activities and contribute to inefficiency and duplication of processes, said the Report of Network Hospital Management prepared by the joint working group of IRDAI and NHA.
The IRDAI-NHA group recommended that the private insurance industry should also adopt the uniform cost of packages. However, the IRDAI can come up with the guidelines on inclusion of additional/ variable cost for implants and category of wards. Private insurance can design the products as per the uniform package cost and the additional cost of implant and ward type.
ADVERTISEMENT
The group also recommended that a standard grading system for hospitals based on the quality parameters should be prepared and same grading can be used by PM-JAY (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) and private insurance market. The committee also recommended a single unique hospital registration process and repository, ideally ROHINI (Registry of hospitals in network of insurance), instead of having several lists. “This list will be beneficial as the central health facility repository/registration number can be used by various schemes and insurance service providers for identification of the health facilities in geographical areas,” it said.
IRDAI is pushing to implement two high tech projects – Health Claims Exchange and Bima Sugam – to deepen insurance penetration and simplify the claim procedures.
ADVERTISEMENT
The insurance regulator now wants general insurers to be part of the Health Exchange platform, which is being set up by the National Health Authority. The platform will digitise and simplify the process of filing health insurance claims. The proposed process is not only quick and hassle-free but also reduces the cost per claim to the insurer. The policyholders and hospitals can track the claim status online and it also enables automatic fund transfer of the claim amount.
Furthermore, the policyholder will be able to provide complete medical data to the hospital, track the claim status anytime and experience a faster and hassle-free claim process. The move will be beneficial for all the parties — insurers, hospitals and policyholders.
Bima Sugam is considered a revolutionary step with ambitions of becoming the largest online market for insurance products and services which has not been practised anywhere in the world. All insurance requirements, including those for life, health and general insurance (including motor and travel) will be met by Bima Sugam.
There is also a proposal before the government and the regulator for composite insurance licences which will enable an insurer to offer both life and non-life products. India, which is the 10th largest insurance market in the world, is poised to be 6th largest insurance market in the world by 2032.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/insurance-for-all-finmin-pushes-for-health-regulator-9078235/,business
Over 60 digital rights groups call for withdrawal of Telecom Bill,"“The Bill in its current form poses a grave threat to fundamental rights, democracy, and the internet as we know it, and must be withdrawn and altered in order to remove these flaws,” the letter, which includes signatories like the Signal Foundation and Mozilla, said.","More than 60 digital rights organisations including those that back popular tech platforms like Signal and the Firefox browser have written to Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging him to withdraw the telecom Bill which was passed by Rajya Sabha Thursday.
“The Bill imperils encryption, a crucial tool for privacy and free expression; amplifies unchecked powers of the government to impose internet shutdowns; and enhances surveillance without independent oversight,” they said in the letter.
“The Bill in its current form poses a grave threat to fundamental rights, democracy, and the internet as we know it, and must be withdrawn and altered in order to remove these flaws,” the letter, which includes signatories like the Signal Foundation and Mozilla, said.

They said that in empowering the government to notify standards and conformity assessment measures on “encryption and data processing in telecommunication” without any limitations, the Bill creates “uncertainties around the ability of service providers to offer strong encryption, and develop privacy-respecting innovations”.

Should prioritise income growth over redistribution: Essay published by CEA office,"Noting that while it is a popular idea that redistribution is the solution to raising living standards at a large scale, the essay said there were two problems with the approach.","Noting that “bad inequalities” like unequal access to education and health reduce the potential for India’s growth, besides being unfair to the individual, an essay published by Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran’s office said the country should prioritise income growth over redistribution.
The essay, part of a collection released Thursday, said the rise in inequality in India after the 1991 reforms can be attributed to market incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation. The impact of Covid-19 on inequality has been “transitory,” with the public distribution system and rise in food subsidy substantially curbing a rise in distress levels, it said.
Bad inequalities, the essay said, form one of the most entrenched problems of development whose mitigation lies in a strategic long-term effort. They directly reduce the potential for growth because segments of the population are left behind, lacking the opportunity to contribute to the growth process.

Quoting a 2022 study, the essay said India’s rate of upward mobility has remained broadly constant since Independence. Relying on the same study, it said that contrary to the widely held belief, Dalits and Adivasis have seen some improvement, with Scheduled Castes having undergone considerable improvement.
However, people from the Scheduled Castes are also more likely to fall back into poverty, necessitating long-term conditions for upward mobility rather than a one-time effort, it said quoting another study.
A recent NITI Aayog study had said that between 2015-16 and 2019-21, India lifted more than 13.5 crore people out of multidimensional poverty, courtesy of improvements in indicators like access to cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, and bank accounts, among others. The essay noted that for the “average aspirational India,” such progress at the grassroots matters “much more than the number of billionaires in the country”.
Noting that while it is a popular idea that redistribution is the solution to raising living standards at a large scale, the essay said there were two problems with the approach: the “infeasibility” of taxing wealth, and that average income needs to increase in India several times to afford a decent standard of living for everyone.

It also emphasised that it was important for developing countries like India to prioritise raising incomes over redistribution.
Calling an increase in the number of the middle class crucial, the essay said policy attention towards the class involves looking beyond a polar view of a rich versus poor economy and beyond the “charitable notion” of redistribution towards rights-based claims for economic justice. “In the empowerment of this class lies the path to a self-sustained virtuous growth cycle,” it added.
“Employment generation, coupled with improving the quality of jobs, is a priority. Following this path, the organised sector job market conditions measured by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation and the National Pension System subscriptions indicate a year-on-year increase, pointing towards improved formalisation. Labour market indicators have improved beyond pre-Covid levels, with the unemployment rate falling and the labour force participation rate increasing,” it said.

India has the highest share of government expenditure on public goods per capita, compared to regions like the European Union, Latin America, China and Africa, with the jump being pronounced since 2014. In India, the expenditure on public goods has led to the redistribution of about 6 per cent of the national income to the bottom 50 per cent, the essay noted.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/income-growth-redistribution-cea-essay-9077999/,business
Govt grants one-time exemption to LIC to achieve 25% MPS in 10 years,The government currently holds 96.5 per cent stake in the company.,"The government has granted a one-time exemption to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to achieve 25 per cent Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) within 10 years, the state-owned insurer said on Thursday.
The country’s largest insurer LIC was listed in May 2022. The government had sold over 22.13 crore shares, or a 3.5 per cent stake in LIC, through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The government currently holds 96.5 per cent stake in the company.
In a stock exchange filing, the state-owned insurer said the Department of Economic Affairs has decided to grant a “one-time exemption to LIC to achieve 25 per cent MPS within 10 years from the date of listing i.e., till May 2032”.

Earlier this year, the government had amended the regulation so that listed state-run companies, including banks, will not need to comply with the rule requiring an MPS of 25 per cent even after their privatisation, if the government decides so “in public interest”. The exemption to the MPS rule was earlier available only to government-controlled companies.
The amendment, notified in January — extending it to even after the sale of government stake — is expected to make it more attractive for investors to acquire state-run companies. In July 2021, the government had notified that all listed public sector units would be exempted from MPS.
Shares of LIC closed at Rs 764.55 apiece on the BSE, up 0.52 per cent over Thursday’s close.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/govt-grants-one-time-exemption-to-lic-to-achieve-25-mps-in-10-years-9077990/,business
"India may compensate exporters against UK, EU carbon tax","The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) or carbon tax is expected to have an impact on India’s iron, steel, and aluminum exports worth $8-$9 billion headed into Europe and the UK.","The Centre is exploring a range of relief measures to soften the blow of the carbon tax introduced by the European Union and the UK, which includes offering compensation to exporters affected by the tax to help them remain competitive in the global markets, a government official told The Indian Express.
The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) or carbon tax is expected to have an impact on India’s iron, steel, and aluminum exports worth $8-$9 billion headed into Europe and the UK. However, CBAM has provisions to include more products with high carbon footprint going forward which could mean greater impact over the years.
“There are various options on the table to tackle carbon tax such as seeking longer transition time and repatriation of the duties. We are also looking at other collaborative mechanisms where we devise a way to come out with supportive measures to make the product more competitive. We are discussing and deliberating along these lines,” the official said.

CBAM kicked off on October 1, 2023 with carbon emissions reporting requirements on imports at its borders. But the EU will impose the actual tax from 2026. The period between 2023 to 2026 is known as the transition time.
“Addressing these kinds of measures in an FTA is a challenge. These kinds of measures emanate from WTO provisions that we all have committed to. It allows members to take measures for the protection of human lives, plants, and health. It includes the environment as well,” official added.
India has already challenged carbon tax at the WTO as it believes CBAM is in violation of special and differential treatment (SNDT) provisions of the WTO that advocates longer time periods for implementing agreements and commitments for developing nations to safeguard the trade interests of developing countries.“CBAM undermines SNDT…they argue that if we follow the principle the whole objective gets defeated. But then a country like India will always argue for a longer transition time,” the official said.
Trade experts have also criticised CBAM for violating the principle of international environmental law that says that all states are responsible for aaddressing global environmental destruction yet not equally responsible. Common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) assumes all the more significance for India that barely contributes one-seventh of world’s carbon emission.

“The key emissions source that the EU seeks to tackle is energy, which it imports, and which will be consumed in manufacture of these products. However, the EU creates a very different landscape in its textual proposals in the India-EU FTA. Export pricing discipline under the Energy and Raw materials chapter specifically forbids any incentives by India to its own industry to consume green energy,” Sangeeta Godbole, a former revenue officer who was part of the Indian team negotiating the India-EU free trade deal, said.
After the EU notified CBAM earlier this year, the UK this week said that its version of CBAM will come into effect by 2027. The UK government factsheet said that the UK CBAM will place a carbon price on some of the most emissions intensive industrial goods imported to the UK from the aluminum, cement, ceramics, fertilizer, glass, hydrogen, iron and steel sectors.
Both UK and EU have argued that the objective to introduce CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage which is defined by the movement of production and associated emissions from one country to another due to different levels of decarbonisation effort through carbon pricing and climate regulation.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-compensate-exporters-uk-eu-carbon-tax-9077978/,business

"Indian Gas Exchange plans to soon launch small-scale LNG trading, awaits PNGRB nod",This will be the first instance of exchange trading of natural gas in its liquefied or super-cooled form.,"The Indian Gas Exchange (IGX) plans to soon launch small-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts on its trading platform and has sought the approval of sector regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for the same, the exchange’s chief executive officer Rajesh Mediratta said. This will be the first instance of exchange trading of natural gas in its liquefied or super-cooled form. Currently, the three-year-old IGX offers trading only in natural gas–domestic as well as regasified LNG.
According to Mediratta, small-scale LNG contracts will benefit buyers located in areas that are not connected by natural gas pipelines. He added that the PNGRB’s nod to the proposal is expected soon. Although there is no prohibition on LNG trading in India, IGX is required to seek the regulator’s approval before launching any new contract.
Small-scale LNG refers to direct use of LNG in the liquid form, instead of the conventional route of regasifying it and then using it as natural gas. Regasified LNG, which is essentially natural gas, needs pipelines to be transported to consumers. In areas that are not covered by a natural gas pipeline network, small-scale LNG, which is supplied using cryogenic road tankers, is seen as an alternative route for increasing natural gas consumption.

LNG can be directly used as fuel for heavy commercial vehicles, and is viewed as an alternative for diesel in that segment. A few Indian oil and gas companies have plans to push the use of LNG directly as a vehicular fuel and small-scale LNG fits well into those plans. According to Mediratta, currently around 0.7 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) of LNG is transported by road in India, but the quantum is expected to jump to 5 mscmd over the next five years.
IGX, which is India’s only physical delivery-based gas exchange, plans to launch small-scale LNG contracts for delivery from five LNG terminals—Dahaj, Dabhol, Hazira, Kochi, and Ennore, and plans to add more terminals later.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/indian-gas-exchange-plans-to-soon-launch-small-scale-lng-trading-awaits-pngrb-nod-9076750/,business
RBI Bulletin: ‘Objective of aligning inflation with 4% target far from assured’,"While consumer price index (CPI) -based inflation for FY24 is expected to be at 5.4 per cent, for the first three quarters of 2024-25 it is projected at 4.6 per cent, according to the ‘State of the Economy’ article published in the RBI’s December bulletin.","If inflation is not brought back to the 4 per cent target and ‘tethered there’, there are chances that the growth may get affected, an article published in the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monthly bulletin said.
While consumer price index (CPI) -based inflation for FY24 is expected to be at 5.4 per cent, for the first three quarters of 2024-25 it is projected at 4.6 per cent, according to the ‘State of the Economy’ article published in the RBI’s December bulletin.
“The objective of aligning inflation with the (4 per cent) target on a durable basis is ‘far from assured’. If inflation is not brought back to the target and tethered there, there is a strong likelihood that growth may falter,” the article said.

Headline inflation, as measured by year-on-year changes in the all-India CPI, increased to 5.6 per cent in November 2023 from 4.9 per cent in October. In September, CPI print was at 5.02 per cent. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has emphatically said that the central bank is completely focused on achieving the 4 per cent inflation target. In the December policy, the RBI kept the repo rate – the key policy rate – unchanged at 6.5 per cent for the fifth time in a row due to concerns over higher inflation amid uncertain food prices.
The article further said that the softer inflation prints for September and October 2023 and the prolonged pause in the stance of monetary policy has engendered a certain hypermetropia among some stakeholders – an irrational long-sightedness whereby inflation forecasts gravitating towards the 4 per cent target sometime in the distant future are sighted clearly whereas high near-term risks of spikes in inflation outcomes on the back of food volatility are blurred.
Under these conditions, a clamour rises for rate cuts or at least that the central bank commits to a path of moderation in the level of the policy rate. Such views imperil the conduct of monetary policy in the pursuit of its goal of durably aligning inflation with the (4 per cent) target,” the article said, adding that these views also undermine the foundations of growth.
The article is prepared by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Patra and other central bank officials. The RBI said the views published in the article are of the authors and not of the institution. The earlier editions of the ‘State of the Economy’ article had pointed out that households’ inflation expectations are still not settled; business and consumer confidence in the inflation outlook is yet to turn optimistic. On a real-time basis, inflation is hurting discretionary consumer spending and this, in turn, is holding back topline growth of manufacturing companies as well as their capex, it had said. On economy, the article said that despite significant global headwinds, the Indian economy remained the fastest growing major economy in 2023. As per the projections, the growth is likely to be sustained in H2:2023-24 and 2024-25 despite some moderation.

CPI inflation for FY24

The RBI, in its December monetary policy, revised the real GDP projection for FY24 to 7 per cent from 6.5 per cent earlier. “In India, the broad-based strengthening of economic activity that is under way will likely be sustained by easing input costs and corporate profitability,” it said.

"Global crude oil, fuel flows via Suez Canal plunge amid Houthi threat; supplies to India largely unaffected","Oil shipments to India have not been impacted so far. This is because a bulk of the country’s West Asian crude oil imports do not take that route, and tankers carrying Russian oil do not appear to be under threat from the rebels.","With a number of global shipping majors and oil companies now avoiding transiting through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the wake of recent attacks on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, global oil and petroleum product flows through the maritime channel have declined by over 50 per cent in December from their regular levels, as per ship tracking data.
Oil shipments to India, however, have not been impacted so far. This is because a bulk of the country’s West Asian crude oil imports do not take that route, and tankers carrying Russian oil do not appear to be under threat from the rebels.
“Global crude and oil product flows through the Suez Canal have already halved in December, dropping from their usual 7 million bpd (barrels per day) rate to 3.4 million bpd, and most probably edging even lower in the remaining part of this month,” said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at commodity market analytics firm Kpler.

Explained | Attacks on ships, costly rerouting and more: What is happening in Red Sea, as spillover of Gaza war
Over the past few days, a few cargo ships have come under attack from the Houthi rebels around the Bab-al-Mandeb strait, which leads to the Red Sea and Suez Canal, forming the shortest, albeit narrow, route to the Mediterranean Sea and beyond from the Arab Peninsula, North-East Africa, and the Arabian Sea. The route is seen as an important artery of global goods and energy supplies. The Houthis have so far claimed that they are targeting vessels with links to Israel in view of its military offensive in Gaza.
Prior to December, the Suez Canal and the Red Sea accounted for around 10 per cent of global crude oil flows and 14 per cent of petroleum product flows, as per Kpler data. But as a number of major shipping companies are now avoiding the route, choosing instead to go around the African continent via the Cape of Good Hope, the share of global oil and petroleum product flows passing through the Suez Canal has now dropped significantly, Katona said.
As for oil shipments to India from its major suppliers, industry watchers do not expect much of an impact as most of India’s oil from key West Asian suppliers like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) comes through the Strait of Hormuz that connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. India, however, does depend on the Suez Canal and Red Sea route for its Russian oil imports. But so far, tankers carrying Russian oil have appeared impervious to the Houthi threat.
“India’s crude supply is relatively safe. First of all, of all the tankers that were hit, there were no crude tankers at all. Second of all, Saudi and Iraqi exports avoid the Bab-al-Mandeb area completely, so there is no risk of getting hit. Third, Russian tankers seem to be immune to Houthi retaliation, so it is highly unlikely there would be any impact on Russian crude flows,” Katona said.
ADVERTISEMENT
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement. Russia is currently India’s top source of oil, followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.
Most of India’s Russian oil imports take the Suez Canal-Red Sea route and so far, it is business as usual on that front. In fact, currently four oil tankers carrying Urals crude from Russia are headed to the Bab-al-Mandeb strait and all are headed for deliveries at Indian ports, as per ship tracking data. Oil and shipping analysts do not foresee tankers carrying Russian oil coming under attack in the region as Russia is perceived as Iran’s ally. The Houthi rebels are widely believed to be backed by Tehran.
As for international oil prices, the crisis has so far had a limited impact. While there has been some upward pressure on prices due to the likelihood of higher transportation costs linked to rerouting, the prices have not really shot up. This is because the disruption is being seen as limited to rerouting of shipments through the much longer route going around Africa, and is highly unlikely to impact oil production and availability. For instance, a crude shipment from Saudi Arabia to Rotterdam takes around 42 days around the Cape of Good Hope, against 24 days through the Suez Canal. So, the uptick in prices is expected to be largely on account of higher cost of freight and insurance as nothing else has changed in the physical oil market.

"Govt allows extra borrowing ceiling of over Rs 60,000 crore to states for NPS",. States are eligible to borrow Rs 1.43 lakh crore on the recommendation of the power ministry in FY24.,"The Department of Expenditure under the Ministry of Finance has allowed extra borrowing of Rs 60,876.80 crore to 22 states for contribution to National Pension System (NPS) for 2023-24. In a post on Tuesday on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, the Ministry said this extra borrowing would be allowed over and above the net borrowing ceiling for this fiscal.
The normal net borrowing ceiling for states is fixed at 3 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) or Rs 8,59,988 crore in absolute terms for FY24 as recommended by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. Additional borrowing of 0.5 per cent of GSDP linked to performance in power sector is also permitted to states. States are eligible to borrow Rs 1.43 lakh crore on the recommendation of the power ministry in FY24.
States have been allowed extra borrowing ceiling equivalent to employer and employee share of contribution of its employees to the NPS over and above the normal net borrowing ceiling of 3 per cent of GSDP for FY24. “Extra borrowing ceiling of Rs 60,876.80 crore allowed to 22 states in 2023-24 (as on October 27, 2023) for NPS contribution by complying states,” the ministry said.

States have the provision of tapping into the Rs 1.3 lakh crore 50-year interest-free capex loans facility for FY24. Capital expenditure of Rs 91,471.43 crore has been approved for 25 states, out of which Rs 57,090.39 crore has been released to eligible states, the ministry said.
In the backdrop of some states opting to return to Old Pension Scheme (OPS), the Centre had offered this additional borrowing limit equivalent to NPS contribution in FY23 also to encourage states to remain in the NPS. As per data shared by Finance Ministry in Parliament last week, total number of subscribers under NPS, including central government, state government, and corporates is 1,06,69,257 as on October 31. The total number of central government pensioners were 67.95 lakh as on October 31.
The state governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh have informed the central government or the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) about their decision to revert to OPS for their state government employees. “These state governments have requested for withdrawal/refund of contribution along with return thereon. However, the Government of Punjab has also informed the Government of India that it continues to pay staff and Government contributions to the NPS,” the ministry had said in its reply.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-allows-extra-borrowing-ceiling-of-over-rs-60000-crore-to-states-for-nps-9075223/,business

Exchange rate flexibility is a key shock absorber for India: IMF,"The IMF has reclassified India's ""de facto"" exchange rate regime to ""stabilized arrangement"" from ""floating"" for December 2022 to October 2023 following an article IV review of the country's policies. The rupee has moved between 80.8 and 83.4 range during the period.","At a time when capital inflows have started rising and the economy is revving up, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) directors have agreed that India’s exchange rate flexibility should remain the first line of defense in absorbing external shocks, with foreign exchange interventions limited to addressing disorderly market conditions, the IMF said.
On IMF staff’s recent reclassification of India’s de facto exchange rate regime for the period December 2022 to October 2023, IMF said many of its executive directors noted the “divergence of authorities’ views” with that of staff and encouraged continued staff engagement on this issue, with a few Directors encouraging staff and the authorities to resolve these differences.

“A few directors explicitly supported the (Indian) authorities’ view that exchange rate stability reflects improvements in India’s external position and that foreign exchange interventions have been used to avoid excessive volatility not warranted by fundamentals,” IMF said in a report.

India’s foreign exchange reserves touched $ 606.8 billion last week following a surge in capital inflows. IMF directors welcomed that the financial sector remains stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets, and adequate capital and liquidity buffers. The Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with India, it said. “India’s economy showed robust growth over the past year. Headline inflation has, on average, moderated although it remains volatile,” the IMF said. Employment has surpassed the pre-pandemic level and, while the informal sector continues to dominate, formalisation has progressed. The financial sector has been resilient—strongest in several years—and largely unaffected by global financial stress in early 2023, IMF said.
The current account deficit in the FY2022-23 (FY23) widened as the post-pandemic recovery of domestic demand and transitory external shocks outweighed the impact of robust services exports and proactive diversification of critical oil imports. While the budget deficit has eased, public debt remains elevated and fiscal buffers need to be rebuilt. Globally, India’s 2023 G20 presidency has demonstrated the country’s important role in advancing multilateral policy priorities.
“While acknowledging declining systemic financial risks, directors broadly called for continued supervision and the use of prudential tools to preserve financial stability and manage emerging vulnerabilities, including rapid growth in unsecured personal loans. They advised further strengthening of regulatory and supervisory standards and encouraged public banks to continue building capital buffers,” the IMF added. The IMF said growth is expected to remain strong, supported by macroeconomic and financial stability. Real GDP is projected to grow at 6.3 per cent in FY24 and FY25, IMF said.

However, with better-than-expected second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) print at 7.6 per cent, the RBI, earlier this month, revised its growth estimate upwards to 7 per cent from 6.5 per cent for FY24.
The IMF said its headline inflation is expected to gradually decline to the target although it remains volatile due to food price shocks. The current account deficit is expected to improve to 1.8 per cent of GDP in FY24 as a result of resilient services exports and, to a lesser extent, lower oil import costs, the IMF said.
“Directors commended the Reserve Bank of India’s proactive monetary policy actions and strong commitment to price stability. They agreed that the current neutral monetary policy stance, anchored on a data dependent approach, is appropriate and should gradually bring inflation back to target,” it said.

India tops remittance flows at USD 125 billion in 2023: World Bank,"On India, the World Bank said the main contributing factors are declining inflation and strong labour markets in high-income source countries, which boosted remittances from highly skilled Indians in the US, the UK, and Singapore.","India saw the highest amount of remittance inflows in the world in 2023 at USD 125 billion, driven by several factors, including the country’s agreement with the UAE, for promoting the use of dirhams and rupees for bilateral trade, the World Bank said.
In a report, the World Bank further said growth in remittances in India is expected to halve to 12.4 per cent in 2023 from a historic peak of 24.4 per cent in 2022.
“Remittances are expected to increase by USD 14 billion and rise to USD 125 billion in 2023, increasing India’s share in South Asian remittances to 66 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2022,” said the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief.
India was followed by Mexico (USD 67 billion), China (USD 50 billion), the Philippines (USD 40 billion), and Egypt (USD 24 billion). Economies where remittance inflows represent substantial shares of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — highlighting the importance of remittances for funding current account and fiscal shortfalls — are Tajikistan (48 per cent), Tonga (41 per cent), Samoa (32 per cent), Lebanon (28 per cent), and Nicaragua (27 per cent).
ADVERTISEMENT
On India, the World Bank said the main contributing factors are declining inflation and strong labour markets in high-income source countries, which boosted remittances from highly skilled Indians in the US, the UK, and Singapore, which collectively account for 36 per cent of the total remittance flows to New Delhi. “Remittance flows to India were also boosted by higher flows from the GCC, especially the UAE, which accounts for 18 per cent of India’s total remittances and is the second-largest source of them after the US,” the report said.
It further said remittance flows to India benefited particularly from its February 2023 agreement with the UAE for establishing a framework to promote the use of local currencies for cross-border transactions and cooperation for interlinking payment and messaging systems. The use of dirhams and rupees in cross-border transactions will be instrumental in channeling more remittances through formal channels, it said.
Remittances to low- and middle-income countries grew an estimated 3.8 per cent in 2023, a moderation from the high gains of the previous two years. Of concern is the risk of decline in real income for migrants in 2024 in the face of global inflation and low growth prospects, the report added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-tops-remittance-flow-2023-world-bank-9075027/,business
RBI tightens norms to check evergreening of loans by lenders through AIFs,"Banks and NBFCs, which are Regulated Entities (RE) under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), make investments in units of AIFs as part of their regular investment operations.","In a move to curb “evergreening” of loans, the Reserve Bank on Tuesday barred banks and NBFCs from investing in any scheme of Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) having investment in companies that have taken loan from the lenders concerned in the past 12 months.

"IMF reclassifies India’s exchange rate regime to ‘stabilised arrangement’, faces RBI pushback","The IMF reclassification followed the Reserve Bank of India's likely forex interventions where the rupee traded in a ""very narrow range, suggesting intervention likely exceeded levels necessary to address disorderly market conditions,"" IMF said in the report.","The International Monetary Fund has reclassified India’s “de facto” exchange rate regime to “stabilized arrangement” from “floating” for December 2022 to October 2023 after an article IV review, with the central bank pushing back against the move.
The IMF reclassification followed the Reserve Bank of India’s likely forex interventions where the rupee traded in a “very narrow range, suggesting intervention likely exceeded levels necessary to address disorderly market conditions,” IMF said in the report.
The IMF’s Article IV consultation report reviews a country’s current and medium-term economic policies and outlook.
ADVERTISEMENT
The IMF’s staff diverged from Indian authorities’ view that “exchange rate stability reflects improvements in India’s external position” and that “foreign exchange interventions have been used to avoid excessive volatility not warranted by fundamentals.”
The RBI strongly believes that such a view is “incorrect” and “unjustified”, the report said. Governor Shaktikanta Das said in October that currency market interventions should not be seen as “black and white.”
The RBI and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Between December 2022 and October 2023, the rupee traded between 80.88-83.42 against the U.S. dollar. This has since narrowed to 82.90-83.42, with volatility expectations falling to the lowest in over a decade.
“Our view has been that the intervention-led reduction in rupee volatility in recent months has been extraordinary,” said Dhiraj Nim, forex strategist at ANZ.
ADVERTISEMENT
“While it is anybody’s guess why the RBI prefers such a narrow trading band, it does look to be overdone,” said Nim.
However, apart from building forex reserves, the intervention may also help reduce the currency risk from the central bank’s inflation fight, Nim said.
“Going forward, a flexible exchange rate should act as the first line of defense in absorbing external shocks,” the fund said.

The IMF also projected India’s economy will grow at 6.3% in both the current fiscal year and the next, below the RBI’s forecast of 7% in the current year.
“India has potential for even higher growth, with greater contributions from labor and human capital if comprehensive reforms are implemented,” the IMF said.
Headline inflation is expected to gradually decline to the target although it remains volatile due to food price shocks, it added.
Volatile food prices pushed up retail inflation to 5.55% in November, above the central bank’s target of 4%.
The fund called for India to pursue “ambitious” medium-term consolidation efforts given elevated public debt levels, while welcoming the near-term approach of accelerating capital spending amid a tightening fiscal stance.

"Decline in FDI temporary, India’s long term growth story strong: DPIIT Secretary",Tweaking of PLI tenure on the table; Incentives for white goods PLI will start flowing in the last quarter of FY24: Secretary,"The recent drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was triggered by a combination of geo-politocal challenges and monetary tightening in the developed countries that are the key investors across the globe but does not pose a long term challenge, DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said in an interview to The Indian Express.
FDI into India registered a sharp slip by 24 per cent to $20.48 billion in April-September 2023-24 largely led by decline in the inflows in sectors such as computer hardware and software, telecom, auto and pharma. Concerned by the decline, the government had invited fund managers and start-up founders among other stakeholders for a crucial meeting to find out ways to weed out operational challenges impeding investments.

"When we look around the globe, the Indian economy is doing very best: SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara",Dinesh Kumar Khara says the banking system has learned from past mistakes and lending has become much better and much more informed.,"The era of loan write-offs is over, the asset quality review (AQR) initiated in 2015 under then Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has served the system well, and the State Bank of India (SBI) is now prepared to fund asset growth of Rs 7 lakh crore, having ploughed back Rs 65,000 crore of profit into capital over the last two years, said Dinesh Kumar Khara, the Chairman of India’s largest bank.
The AQR led to the surfacing of a huge chunk of bad loans, Khara told The Indian Express in an interview. “It (AQR) did a good job. It could help banks to ensure that whatever was required to be provided for, it should be provided for.”
After Indian banks wrote off a huge amount of bad loans — more than Rs 10 lakh crore — in the last five years, lending by banks has become much better and much more informed, with different banks at different stages strengthening their risk management and underwriting practices, said the SBI Chairman.

Rajan’s AQR had initially come under criticism by some economists in the government for having slowed down economic growth and, later, for underestimating the extent of bad loans.
Over the last five years, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks have dropped by almost 46 per cent — from Rs 10.21 lakh crore in fiscal year (FY) 2017-2018 to Rs 5.55 lakh crore by March 2023.

Khara said the Indian economy is in a golden phase with economic activity picking up in the agriculture sector in the second half, FMCG data showing a positive trend and practically all sectors firing. “I would say that perhaps it (the economy) is in a golden phase. In agriculture, where, in the first half, there were little concerns, but in the second half we have started seeing economic activity picking up even in the agricultural sector. When we look at FMCG data as well, the second-half very clearly is showing a positive trend. I think to that extent, practically all sectors are firing, if I may say so. It’s a very positive sign,” Khara said.
“Also, when we look around the globe, the Indian economy is doing its very best,” he said. “A significant portion of our GDP is our domestic economy. International markets have challenges and to that extent, that eventually shows up in our international trade.”

Khara said SBI was ready to finance a higher economic growth rate. “Even with the current capital, we can support the asset growth of Rs 7 lakh crore-plus. So, Rs 7 lakh crore kind of growth on a base of Rs 35 lakh crore is more than 20 per cent. So, that’s the kind of situation we are in. We are fully geared up,” he said.
He said in the last two years itself, SBI has added about Rs 65,000 crore of profit to the capital. This year (FY’24) in the first half, it has already earned more than Rs 31,000 crore in profit. “We would be ploughing back a significant portion of the year-end profit also,” he said.
SBI’s total loan book size is Rs 35 lakh crore. The retail book is Rs 12 lakh crore, of which Rs 7 lakh crore is mortgage. MSME book would be about Rs 3.8 lakh crore and agriculture is around Rs 2.8 lakh crore. Mid-corporate book is around Rs 5 lakh crore and large corporate is Rs 4.5 lakh crore.

On economic activity in the country, Khara said: “Our exposure is so broadly dispersed that we get to see activity everywhere. Somewhere it would be in retail, somewhere is SME and somewhere it would be in agri.” Practically the whole country is looking at the growth of ambition, he said.
SBI shares Friday (December 15) rose 4 per cent to Rs 648.40 on the BSE. When Khara assumed office in October 2020, the SBI stock was at Rs 117 apiece. He said: “I work for my stakeholders… I don’t look at this number. Yes, once in a while I must look at it. People have got apprehensions in their minds which are unfounded. See, there is a capital constraint… if at all, you tell me which bank has ploughed back Rs 65,000 crore in two years’ time, adding to the capital.”

"FPIs flood Indian equity markets, infuse Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2023 despite global uncertainty",This follows Indian equities witnessing the worst-ever net outflow of Rs 1.21 lakh crore by FPIs in 2022 on aggressive rate hikes by the central banks globally after net inflows for three consecutive years.,"In a dazzling resurgence, foreign investors have graced the Indian equity markets with an influx of nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2023, fuelled by optimism over the country’s resilient economic fundamentals amid shadows of a gloomy global scenario. Experts believe that the positive trend may continue in 2024.
This follows Indian equities witnessing the worst-ever net outflow of Rs 1.21 lakh crore by FPIs in 2022 on aggressive rate hikes by the central banks globally after net inflows for three consecutive years.
Going forward, as the general elections approach next year, political stability and economic growth will become focal points for foreign investors. Besides, global cues on the inflation and interest rate scenario would dictate the flow of foreign money into Indian equities, said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India.
ADVERTISEMENT
India, with its promising position for economic growth, is expected to continue attracting foreign investment flows, he added.
As of now, the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have made a net investment of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the Indian equity markets and around Rs 60,000 crore in the debt market. Collectively, they pumped over Rs 2 lakh crore into the capital market, according to data available from the depositories.
Of Rs 1.5 lakh crore net equity market inflow, close to Rs 43,000 crore have been invested in the first two weeks of December following the enhanced political stability, owing to the BJP’s success in recent elections across three significant states. If this trend persists, it could become the best year for FPI flow.
FPIs made a net infusion of Rs 25,752 crore in equities in 2021, Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2020, which was the best year, and Rs 1.01 lakh crore in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the year 2022, the flows from foreign investors were largely driven by factors like inflation and interest rate scenarios in developed markets, such as the US and UK, currency movement, the trajectory of crude oil prices, geopolitical scenario and the health of the domestic economy, among others, Srivastava said.
Heightened FPI investment was triggered by the nation’s resilient economic fundamentals, forward-looking policy reforms, optimistic corporate earnings outlook, global liquidity trends, and a growing recognition of India’s enduring long-term growth potential, said Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Mazars in India. Mazars is an international audit, tax and advisory firm.
“India is one of the top investment destinations of FPIs. There is a near consensus now in the global investing community that India has the best prospects among the emerging economies for sustained growth for many years to come,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This growth has the potential to create phenomenal wealth through the stock market. FPIs are investing to benefit from this potential wealth creation,” he added.
After pulling back for three consecutive years, foreign investors made a comeback in the debt markets as well this year, as they injected around Rs 60,000 crore in 2023 (till December 15), marking a noteworthy shift in their capital flow.
They took out funds totalling Rs 15,910 crore in 2022, Rs 10,359 crore in 2021, and Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2020.
The announcement by JP Morgan Chase & Co in September that it will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging market index from June next year has influenced the inflow in the country’s bond markets this year, said Mayank Mehraa, smallcase Manager and Principal Partner at Craving Alpha.
This landmark inclusion, scheduled for June 2024, is expected to benefit India by attracting around USD 20-40 billion in the subsequent 18-24 months. This can make Indian bonds more accessible to foreign investors and potentially strengthen the rupee, thereby, bolstering the economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
In terms of sectors, FPIs preferred financial, IT, pharma, and energy sectors owing to the country’s strength in technology and healthcare, and commitment to sustainable development contributed to the appeal for foreign investors.
FPIs started the year on a negative note, and a departure of “hot money” was seen in the first two months when they pulled out over Rs 34,000 crore.
ADVERTISEMENT
But, FPIs shifted gears and turned buyers in March and incessantly purchased equities till August on the resilience of the Indian economy amid an uncertain global macro backdrop. During these six months, they pumped in Rs 1.74 lakh crore.
However, FPIs departed from equities in September, and the negative trend continued in the succeeding month, owing to economic uncertainties in the US and Eurozone regions as well as growing concerns about global economic growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
Additionally, higher crude prices, sticky inflation numbers, and the expectation that the interest rate may continue to remain at elevated levels longer than expected prompted foreign investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.
In November, FPIs again turned buyers with a net investment of Rs 9,000 crore, and the positive momentum has continued this month on the outcome of recent elections across three significant states.
Internationally, signals from the US Federal Reserve about three prospective rate cuts in the upcoming year marked a departure from the prevailing high-interest rate regime also prompted FPIs to invest.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/fpis-flood-indian-equity-markets-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-in-2023-global-uncertainty-9071533/,business
Academia needs to step up with more fundamental research on chips: Hitesh Garg,"In an interview with Aggam Walia, Garg highlighted how chip design can improve EV battery longevity and secure devices against evolving cyber threats, and the need for more research at the university level.","On India’s efforts at becoming a global semiconductor manufacturing hub, Hitesh Garg, Vice President & India country manager at Nasdaq-listed NXP Semiconductors, which has a market capitalisation of $60 billion with 35 per cent of its R&D workforce across four cities in India, said that the thriving chip design ecosystem in the country can support budding manufacturing capacities in a symbiotic manner. In an interview with Aggam Walia, Garg highlighted how chip design can improve EV battery longevity and secure devices against evolving cyber threats, and the need for more research at the university level.
In 2021, there was a crippling chip shortage in the automotive industry which continued for several quarters. How do things stand now?
Car manufacturers use this method called just-in-time, which means ordering a component an hour before it is needed to be assembled in a car. I think it is a method that gives the highest level of efficiency. However, after the coronavirus pandemic hit, car manufacturers told chip manufacturers they would not need chips for the next six months to one year because of reduced demand. We also unreserved our capacity in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) factory as we did not want the chips we were designing for the automotive industry.

India will remain lower middle economy by 2047 if growth rate is not over 6%: Raghuram Rajan,"Speaking at a programme in Hyderabad, the economist said if the country does not grow faster, it will grow older (demographically) before it gets richer, which means there is the burden of an aging population to deal with also at that point.","Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said India will still remain a lower middle country if the growth rate remains at 6 per cent annually without any rise in population by 2047 (Amrit Kaal) and will be reaching the end of the demographic dividend by then.
Speaking at a programme organised by Manthan in Hyderabad, the economist said if the country does not grow faster, it will grow older (demographically) before it gets richer, which means there is the burden of an aging population to deal with also at that point.
“If you do the math, at 6 per cent a year, you double every 12 years, and therefore in 24 years, we’ll be four times our per capita income. Today, the per capita income in India, as you know, is just a little below $2,500 per person. multiply by four, we get $10,000 per person…So if you do the math, at our current rate of growth, you know, strong as it is highest in the G20, we don’t get rich but we stay lower middle income till 2047,” he said.

The former RBI chief said some southern states are growing with regards to population at below reproduction rate, in other words, the fertility rate has fallen below reproduction rate thus slowing the growth.
“In other words, we will start the process of aging at some point around that time, which leads to the alarming question if we don’t grow faster, we will grow old before we grow rich, which means we all have all the burdens of an aging population to deal with also at that point,” he opined.
According to him, the current pace of growth is not enough to employ all those who are entering the labour force and insufficient to make the country us get rich, before it gets old.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-remain-lower-middle-economy-growth-rate-raghuram-rajan-9071171/,business

44% rise in value of home sales in 9 months,"Overall sales value of homes sold in nine months was highest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (Rs 1.64 lakh crore) followed by NCR (Rs 50,188 crore).","Housing units worth Rs 3.49 lakh crore were sold across the top 7 cities in the first nine months of calendar year 2023 as against Rs 2.43 lakh crore in the same period of last year, registering a rise of 44 per cent, says a report.

At the current sales momentum, the ongoing December quarter is expected to see Rs one lakh crore worth housing inventory sold in top cities, taking total sales value above Rs 4.5 lakh crore, it said.
The rise in housing sales value in January-October period of 2023, exceeding that of entire 2022, points to a large number of high-ticket value homes sold this year, Anarock said.

Sales value in Kolkata was lowest at Rs 9,025 crore. Pune saw 63,483 units sold till September 2023 with total sales value of Rs 39,945 crore, indicating higher sales of low-ticket value homes.
Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group, said: “The fact that the housing sales value in the first nine months 2023 exceeded that of the whole of entire 2022 reflects the increased demand for premium luxury homes this year. This, along with the fact that average prices in the top cities rose by anywhere between 8-18 per cent this year, makes an apple-to-apple comparison of annual sales values challenging.”
“If we look at the quarter-on-quarter sales values in 2023, each quarter saw consistent growth and overall sales value has already breached the Rs one lakh crore mark,” Puri said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/home-sales-value-rise-9069949/,business

"Ready to import oil from any country not under sanctions, including Venezuela: Hardeep Singh Puri","At least three Indian refiners — Reliance Industries (RIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) — are understood to have booked Venezuelan oil cargoes, which are expected to land in India over the next couple of months.","India will buy crude oil from Venezuela as a number of Indian refineries are equipped to process heavy crudes, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said. With the United States (US) easing sanctions on Caracas in October, India’s imports of Venezuelan oil are set to resume after three years. The minister said that as a major international consumer of crude oil, India is willing to buy oil from any country that is not under sanctions.
At least three Indian refiners — Reliance Industries (RIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) — are understood to have booked Venezuelan oil cargoes, which are expected to land in India over the next couple of months. Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) is also looking to start imports of oil from the Latin American country.
“Many of our refineries, including (IOC’s) Paradip (refinery), are capable of using that heavy Venezuelan oil, and we will buy…We always buy from Venezuela. It’s when Venezuela came under sanctions that they were not able to supply,” Puri said, adding that India is willing to buy crude from any country that is not under sanctions.

India — specifically private sector refiners RIL and Nayara Energy (NEL)–was a regular buyer of Venezuelan crude prior to imposition of US sanctions on Caracas in 2019. Following the sanctions, oil imports from Venezuela stopped. According to data from commodity market analytics firm Kpler, India last imported Venezuelan crude in November 2020.
As per India’s official trade data, Venezuela was New Delhi’s fifth-largest supplier of oil in 2019, providing close to 16 million tonnes of crude to Indian refiners. In value terms, India’s 2019 oil imports from Venezuela stood at $5.70 billion.
In October this year, Washington eased sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector, authorising oil exports without limitation for six months. Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has the largest proven oil reserves in the world.
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement. Given the volatility in the oil markets over the past nearly two years, the government has maintained that India will buy from wherever it can get cheaper oil.

Venezuela has reportedly been offering steep discounts to Chinese independent refiners, who have been its biggest buyers of oil through the sanctions. However, recent reports suggest that the discounts have narrowed considerably in recent weeks due to the easing of sanctions and other buyers now willing to pick up Venezuelan oil. Caracas appears eager to sell its crude in other major markets and is likely offering discounts to willing buyers.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-import-oil-venezuela-hardeep-singh-puri-9069466/,business
"SBI hikes MCLR by 5-10 basis points across different tenors, other lenders likely to follow","The hikes in MCLR by the lender come even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent in its monetary policy announced on December 8. This move is likely to be followed by other lenders, resulting in costlier loans for borrowers.","The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has increased its marginal cost of fund based lending rate (MCLR) by 5-10 basis points (bps) across various tenors, effective today.
The hikes in MCLR by the lender come even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent in its monetary policy announced on December 8. This move is likely to be followed by other lenders, resulting in costlier loans for borrowers.
The interest rates on one – and – three-month MCLRs have been revised up by 5 bps to 8.2 per cent from 8.15 per cent earlier, as per the information on the bank’s website. One basis point (bps) is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
ADVERTISEMENT
For six-to-three-year MCLRs, the rates have been revised up by 10 bps. The lender is offering interest rates of 8.55 per cent and 8.65 per cent on six-month and one-year MCLRs, respectively. The new rate on two-year MCLR is 8.75 per cent and on the three-year tenor is 8.85 per cent.
This is for the first time since July 2023 that SBI has hiked its MCLR. In July, it increased MCLR by 5 bps across all tenors.
Introduced on April 1, 2016, MCLR is the minimum interest rates below which banks cannot lend. It reflects the trends in banks’ cost of borrowing.
In 2019, the RBI introduced the external benchmark linked rate (EBLR) – which is linked to the repo rate – to further increase the pace of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all the retail loans are linked to EBLR.
ADVERTISEMENT
While any hike or cut in the repo rate gets immediately reflected in loans linked to EBLR, banks review interest rates under MCLR regime every month at a pre-announced date.
In response to the 250 bps hikes in the repo rate by the RBI since May 2022, lenders have revised their repo-linked EBLRs by the same quantum.
The revision in MCLR happens with a lag. The 1-year median MCLR increased by 152 bps during May 2022 to October 2023, the ‘State of the Economy’ article published in the RBI’s monthly bulletin for November showed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sbi-hikes-mclr-tenors-lenders-9069396/,business

"As MNCs object to GST secondment notices, CBIC tells officers: Don’t apply SC ruling mechanically",Secondment refers to the deputation of employees or expats to another part of the organisation within or outside the country.,"After multinational companies in India received a number of GST notices over “secondment” of overseas employees, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes (CBIC) has instructed its field officers to not apply a 2022 Supreme Court ruling “mechanically” in all cases.
Secondment refers to the deputation of employees or expats to another part of the organisation within or outside the country. This has led to questions about taxability of such employees — whether they would be treated as part of the Indian subsidiary or the overseas group company.
In May last year, in the case of Northern Operating Systems Pvt. Ltd, the Supreme Court had held that secondment/deputation of employees from the overseas company to an Indian entity is in the nature of “manpower recruitment and supply services” and hence, would be liable to service tax.
ADVERTISEMENT
The authorities had extended this under the GST as well, issuing notices to several multinational companies, including automobile and FMCG firms, seeking details of expats and seconded employees working with them
CBIC’s move, asking officers to carefully investigate each case, comes after the industry made several representations to the CBIC about a blanket invocation of the SC ruling by field formations for all such working arrangements between overseas entities and companies in India.
“It may be relevant to note that there may be multiple types of arrangements in relation to secondment of employees of overseas group company in the Indian entity. In each arrangement, the tax implications may be different, depending upon the specific nature of the contract and other terms and conditions attached to it. Therefore, the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the NOS judgement should not be applied mechanically in all the cases. Investigation  in  each  case  requires  a  careful  consideration  of  its distinct  factual  matrix, including the terms of contract between overseas company and Indian entity, to determine taxability or  its extent under GST and applicability of the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgement in NOS case,” the instructions issued by the CBIC on Wednesday stated.
The CBIC noted that a “careful reading of the NOS judgement” indicates that the Supreme Court’s emphasis is on a “nuanced examination based on the unique characteristics of each specific arrangement, rather than relying on any singular test”. It  has  also  been  represented  by  the  industry  that  in  many  cases  involving secondment, the field formations are mechanically invoking extended period of limitation under section 74(1) of the Central GST (CGST) Act.
ADVERTISEMENT
Section 74(1) of the CGST Act pertains to the determination of non-payment or underpayment of tax or wrongful availment of input tax credit under GST by fraud or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts.
The CBIC said Section 74(1) cannot be invoked merely on account of non-payment of  GST, without specific element of fraud or wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts to evade tax, asking its field formations to take these instructions into consideration for investigating such cases and issuing show cause notices. “Only in the cases where the investigation indicates that there is  material  evidence  of  fraud  or  wilful  mis-statement  or  suppression  of  fact to evade tax on the part of the taxpayer, provisions of section 74(1) of CGST Act may be invoked for issuance of show cause notice, and such evidence should also be made a part of the show cause notice,” it said.
Manish Gaur, Senior Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, said that the instructions issued by the CBIC have brought much relief to the taxpayers as it clarifies that the judgement cannot be applied in a mechanical manner and facts of each case must be carefully analysed before proposing a demand. “The instruction will also require the Department to be open to the probability that there could be cases of employment of foreign persons in India which do not tantamount to import of manpower services, thereby not having a tax implication,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
These instructions will also help in closure of various show cause notices issued on this matter. “Such proactive, timely and much needed directions have played a significant role in successful implementation of GST. Where the said instructions are judiciously followed at ground level, these could help closure of various show cause notices issued on the matter,” Abhishek Jain, Indirect Tax Head & Partner, KPMG said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/as-mncs-object-to-gst-secondment-notices-cbic-tells-officers-dont-apply-sc-ruling-mechanically-9068947/,business

"Common framework for AI welcome, but challenge is to make it truly global: Experts",And that is the story of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) — an attempt largely led by the democratic world to adopt a global risk-based approach to AI.,"As an international grouping took a first step Wednesday in setting up a common global framework to regulate artificial intelligence (AI), experts cautioned that such agreements would only work between like-minded countries.
And that is the story of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) — an attempt largely led by the democratic world to adopt a global risk-based approach to AI.
It includes countries like India, the US, the UK, France, Japan and Canada, among others. But China, a tech superpower, is not part of the multilateral grouping — and, a senior government official said, is unlikely to be invited into the fold.
ADVERTISEMENT
On Wednesday, the GPAI Summit adopted the New Delhi declaration, underscoring the need to mitigate AI risks and promote equitable access to critical resources.
Rama Vedashree, advisor at Dallas Venture Capital, said that while regulatory synergy will naturally emerge globally, it will only happen between “rights-respecting countries”.
“Some principles will emerge and there would be a synergy between various regulations — at least among all the rights respecting countries. I would not say (there would be regulatory synergy in) all the countries that are ahead in terms of technology. Whether you look at the declaration at the UK AI Safety Summit or even the G20 declaration, which had adequate focus on AI and other technologies, there would be a synergy that will come,” Vedashree told The Indian Express.
Thomas Schneider, chair of the Council of Europe Committee on AI, said while it may be easy to solve the smaller challenges related to AI, the bigger ones, where a number of stakeholders are involved, may be much harder to address. He pointed out that global AI regulations can be interoperable only among countries that share the same values.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We will solve the small problems easily. But the big challenges, where many people are involved or everybody’s involved, are much harder to solve… you have to share more or less the same values in order to have interoperable implementations of the values,” he said.
Schneider admitted that the proliferation of AI systems can not be contained, but batted for a framework that can prevent the weaponisation of AI-based systems during wars. “We will have to use these technologies because of competition issues, or simply because people are curious to use them… hopefully we also find a framework that ensures that these technologies are not used to kill each other in war,” he said.
Asked if regulators should prioritise innovation or safety related to AI systems Schneider said: “It should not be an either, or.” He emphasised that regulations need to offer the right incentives to various stakeholders.
ADVERTISEMENT
The EU has introduced its own AI Act. Asked for his recommendations on what India and other countries should prioritise in their own AI-related laws, Schneider said: “…we should respect fundamental values, human rights, not fight against democracy, against the autonomy of the people, against peace”.
Sandip Patel, Managing Director at IBM India & South Asia, said his company welcomes “precision regulation” on AI that would not limit people from using such systems. He also said declarations such as the one adopted at the GPAI Summit can serve as a blueprint for countries to frame regulations as per their specific market needs.
“With declarations like these, like the one that was signed in the UK as well, I think there’s a significant opportunity for countries that are advanced in these technologies and have taken a point of view in terms of some of these policies and frameworks and standards, to create some form of a global framework… that can be used with specific country specific, market specific regulation especially for countries that are ahead in this space,” he said.
“We as a company believe in precision regulation… I do believe that at least for technologies like AI, there is a lot of room to drive precision regulation as to what really needs to be regulated as opposed to limiting anyone from using AI,” Patel said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/common-framework-for-ai-welcome-but-challenge-is-to-make-it-truly-global-experts-9068933/,business

EPFO unveils FAQs on issues linked to higher pension rollout,"For those who will retire in the future, say in 2030, the EPFO said the pension will be calculated based on the provisions of EPS, 1995 that will “exist as on the date of the commencement of pension”.","The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Wednesday released a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the issue of higher pension linked to actual salary. In a circular to its field officers, the EPFO stated that the pensionable formula for those opting for higher pension will be calculated as per para 12 of the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) and that “the date of commencement of pension will determine the applicable formula for calculation of pensionable service, pensionable salary and pension”.
For those who will retire in the future, say in 2030, the EPFO said the pension will be calculated based on the provisions of EPS, 1995 that will “exist as on the date of the commencement of pension”. The FAQs, however, did not state if there will be any change in the pensionable formula for those who retire in the future. People in the know said that there could be tweaks in the pensionable formula for those who retire in the future going ahead.
Giving example for those members whose date of commencement of pension is prior to 01.09.2014, the EPFO reiterated the pensionable salary will be calculated based on the average monthly pay drawn during contributory period of service in the span of 12 months preceding the date of exit from the membership of the pension fund. For those whose date of commencement of pension is on or after 01.09.2014, the pensionable salary will be calculated based on the average monthly pay drawn during the contributory period of 60 months preceding the exit from the membership of the pension fund. Arrears of pension will be paid to the pensioners in line with the existing income tax rules for tax deducted at source (TDS).

The EPFO had kept the deadline to apply for higher pensions till July 11. Following this, it gave further time of three months to employers till September 30 and then another extension till December 31, while employees had time till July 11 to submit their applications.
Members of EPFO’s Central Board of Trustees welcomed the issuance of the FAQs. “If this was issued a few months back, it would have saved the confusion among the pensioners and also the EPFO officers. But, of course, it is always better late than never and I appreciate their action on this now,” K.E. Raghunathan, a CBT member representing employers said.
A total of 32,591 demand letters had been issued with the cumulative demand raised of Rs 1,974 crore till October 12 from the applicants who opted for higher pension under the EPS. The total number of applications for higher pension have totalled around 17.49 lakh.
The Supreme Court in a ruling on November 4 last year upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, providing another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014, to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension.

The pension fund comprises a deposit of 8.33 per cent of the employers’ contribution towards the PF corpus. Both employees and employers contribute 12 per cent of the employee’s basic salary, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, if any, to the EPF. The employee’s entire contribution goes to EPF, while the 12 per cent contribution by the employer is split as 3.67 per cent to EPF and 8.33 per cent to EPS. The Government of India contributes 1.16 per cent of an employee’s pension for those below the wage threshold. Employees do not contribute to the pension scheme.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/epfo-unveils-faqs-on-issues-linked-to-higher-pension-rollout-9067359/,business
"Export-oriented green hydrogen projects may get fiscal support, multi-locational SEZs on the table","The commerce ministry is also looking at notifying SEZs that can be spread out across multiple locations, specifically for green hydrogen projects.","The government is looking at a demand to amend a rule that prevents renewable energy plants set up for captive consumption in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) from receiving tax breaks. The tweak, which is before the Ministry of Commerce, could potentially allow export-oriented green hydrogen projects to avail fiscal benefits for setting up and operating renewable energy plants used for the production of green hydrogen. The commerce ministry is also looking at notifying SEZs that can be spread out across multiple locations, specifically for green hydrogen projects. These suggestions were made by green hydrogen developers at a meeting on October 19 with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), where officials from the Ministry of Commerce were also present, according to the meeting minutes accessed by The Indian Express through the RTI.
Allowing multi-locational SEZs will enable developers to use wind energy for which turbines are placed at a considerable distance from each other. Currently, SEZs must have a contiguous land area of 50 hectares or more, a requirement the commerce ministry is open to relaxing for green hydrogen projects. As per industry estimates, the distance between two wind turbines could be anywhere between 250 metres to 400 metres apart, depending on their size. Without multi-locational SEZs, export-oriented green hydrogen projects using wind energy could face difficulties in securing vast amounts of land for renewable energy generation alone. With multi-locational SEZs, however, they will be able to designate specific and discontiguous patches of land upon which wind turbines are installed as part of a singular SEZ.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/export-oriented-green-hydrogen-projects-may-get-fiscal-support-multi-locational-sezs-on-the-table-9067384/,business
"Global Partnership on AI members adopt New Delhi declaration, bat for equitable access to AI resources","While acknowledging the rapid pace of improvement in advanced AI systems and their potential to generate economic growth, the declaration flagged concerns emanating from such systems including misinformation, unemployment, lack of transparency and fairness, protection of intellectual property and personal data, and threats to human rights and democratic values.","The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), an alliance of 29 member countries, has unanimously adopted the New Delhi declaration underscoring the need to mitigate risks arising from the development and deployment of AI systems, and promoting equitable access to critical resources for AI innovation including computing and high quality diverse datasets.
While acknowledging the rapid pace of improvement in advanced AI systems and their potential to generate economic growth, the declaration flagged concerns emanating from such systems including misinformation, unemployment, lack of transparency and fairness, protection of intellectual property and personal data, and threats to human rights and democratic values.
“We support the intention of India, as Lead Chair for 2024, in its endeavour to promote collaborative AI for global partnership among GPAI members by supporting projects aimed at promoting equitable access to critical resources for AI research and innovation, such as AI computing, high quality diverse datasets, algorithms, software, testbeds, and other AI-relevant resources in compliance with applicable intellectual property protections and data protection legislations,” the declaration said.
ADVERTISEMENT
This is a significant win for India, which has batted for a collaborative approach towards building AI systems as it looks to push its model of digital public infrastructure (DPI) across the world. Besides, access to computing capabilities from member nations will also boost New Delhi’s plans of building a sovereign AI system, something it has outlined as crucial for countering dominance from a handful of foreign companies in the space.
Addressing a press briefing, Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that the declaration seeks to ensure that AI and its benefits are inclusive and available to all the countries of the world, including the Global South. The declaration was adopted following a five hour ministerial deliberation.
The declaration also said that a global framework on AI should be rooted in democratic values and human rights, safeguarding dignity and well-being, ensuring personal data protection, protection of applicable intellectual property rights, privacy, and security, fostering innovation, and promoting, trustworthy, responsible, sustainable and human-centred use of AI.
The GPAI is an attempt, largely led by the democratic world, to adopt a global risk-based approach to AI. It includes countries like India, the United States, the UK, France, Japan, and Canada among others. China, a major tech superpower, is not part of the multilateral grouping.
ADVERTISEMENT
This was also the first time the group’s members were meeting after generative AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google Bard burst into the scene, propelling conversations around AI into the mainstream. To that end, the declaration notes that the GPAI members will play a “pivotal” role in addressing contemporary AI issues, including generative AI, “through applied AI projects aimed at addressing societal problems and global challenges, maximising the benefits and mitigating associated risks”.
GPAI members also agreed to support AI innovation in the agriculture sector as a new “thematic priority”. India was pushing for the inclusion of agriculture as a priority sector in AI innovation, IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had earlier said.
“We acknowledge the importance of promoting the development of and access to risk-proportionate trustworthy AI applications for ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, help regenerate ecosystems, strengthen capacity for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters, and that progressively improve land and soil quality, as well as promote inclusion and empowerment of workers in the agricultural supply chain,” the declaration said.

The declaration also said that the GPAI will pursue a diverse membership, with a particular focus on low and middle-income countries to ensure a broad range of expertise, national and regional views and experiences based on our shared values.

"After onion, it’s garlic’s turn to bite","In both lahsun and pyaaz, a real respite to consumers can come only after March, when their rabi crops are harvested. But there are worries even on that front, due to depleting groundwater tables, particularly in Maharashtra and Karnataka.","A sudden rise in prices of garlic has added to the woes of consumers already paying around Rs 60 per kg for onion. The spicy bulb with stronger taste and odour than the humble pyaaz is currently retailing at around Rs 210 per kg, compared to Rs 40 a year ago and Rs 150 three months back.
Traders are attributing the spike in lahsun (garlic) prices to the delayed harvesting and arrivals of the kharif crop. Garlic, like onion, is cultivated during both the kharif and rabi season. The kharif garlic is planted in June-July and harvested in October-November, while in September-November and March-April for the rabi crop.

Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla buys London mansion: Report,"According to ‘The Financial Times', the Poonawalla family has agreed a deal for the 25,000 square foot Mayfair mansion near Hyde Park named Aberconway House in what is expected to be the most expensive house sale of the year for the UK capital.","Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla has acquired a sprawling mansion in the heart of London worth around GBP 138 million, according to a UK media report on Tuesday.
According to ‘The Financial Times’, the Poonawalla family has agreed a deal for the 25,000 square foot Mayfair mansion near Hyde Park named Aberconway House in what is expected to be the most expensive house sale of the year for the UK capital.
The five-storey property, dating back to the 1920s and Grade II listed, will be acquired by SII’s UK subsidiary Serum Life Sciences, people familiar with the transaction told the newspaper. The sale is said to have been agreed by Dominika Kulczyk, daughter of the late businessman Jan Kulczyk, who was Poland’s richest man.

The red-brick residence is named after Baron Aberconway, Henry Duncan McLaren, a 20th century industrialist who built the Grosvenor Square mansion. According to sources quoted by the newspaper, while the Poonawalla family did not intend to relocate to the UK, the mansion would “serve as a base for the company and family when they are in the UK”.
It follows multi-million-pound UK investments by the family in vaccine research and manufacturing facilities near Oxford.

Airlines likely to save Rs 150-180 cr by using Eastern Cross Taxiways at Delhi airport: DIAL CEO,"DIAL had also said 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emission is equivalent to planting about 15 lakh trees.","Airlines are likely to save around Rs 150-180 crore annually by using the Delhi airport’s Eastern Cross Taxiways that help reduce taxiing time as well as fuel consumption by aircraft, according to a top official.
The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in the national capital, operated by DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd), handles up to 1,500 aircraft movements daily.
In a recent interview, DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said assuming 10-15 per cent of aircraft use the Eastern Cross Taxiways (ECT), it is expected that there would be saving of around 55,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
There can be savings of Rs 150 to Rs 180 crore for airlines by using the ECT, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ECT, which is 2.1 km long and can accommodate wide-body aircraft, will reduce the time spent on the tarmac by passengers after landing and before take-off of their flights. It was inaugurated on July 14.
Citing back of the envelope calculations, Jaipuriar said DIAL has made an estimation of how many aircraft will be using the ECT and how much of travel time will be reduced.
“Each litre of ATF produces 2.5-3 kg of carbon dioxide. If we are talking about saving 55,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, you divide it by 3 and that basically means around 18,000 tonnes of ATF.” “Each tonne of ATF costs Rs 1 lakh and it is Rs 100 per litre… savings for airlines because of lower taxiing time is expected to be around Rs 150-180 crore,” he said.
On an average, Jaipuriar said 7-8 minutes of taxiing time is saved for an aircraft that land in the north and come to the south through the ECT.
ADVERTISEMENT
As per DIAL, the ECT is estimated to save around 350 kg of fuel every time an aircraft taxies through the runway from RW 29R to Terminal 1 and vice-versa.
“This translates into a reduction of nearly 1,114 kilograms of CO2 emissions for each aircraft taxiing along this route. On an annual basis, the ECT is estimated to reduce emissions of approximately 55,000 tonnes of CO2 from aircraft,” it had said in July this year.
DIAL had also said 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emission is equivalent to planting about 15 lakh trees.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ECT connects the northern and southern airfields on the eastern side of the airport and will reduce the taxiing distance for an aircraft by 7 kilometres. The distance an aircraft needs to cover after landing on the third runway and going to Terminal 1 (T1) will be reduced to 2 kilometres from 9 kilometres now.
The dual-lane ECT can handle wide-body aircraft, including A380 and B777 and B747. Each lane is 44 metres wide with a gap of 47 metres between them to allow simultaneous passage of two aircraft.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/airlines-eastern-cross-taxiways-delhi-airport-dial-ceo-9061962/,business
"Need to follow consistent policy, focus on ‘Made in India’: FICCI EV panel chair amid Tesla bid",FICCI has also proposed to the government to cover small electric cars for incentives under the FAME scheme.,"The government should not dilute Make in India initiative and follow a consistent policy, Ficci EV Committee Chairperson Sulajja Firodia Motwani said amid a push from American electric carmaker Tesla for special sops to set up its factory in the country.
Motwani, the founder and CEO of Kinetic Green which sells battery-operated three-wheelers, scooters, e-cycles, and buggies, also emphasised creating a holistic ecosystem for the growth of the electric vehicle segment.
She also batted for the continuation of incentives for buying EVs to sustain the demand for the next few years.

Motwani also noted that the industry body is also pushing for the inclusion of electric cars priced up to Rs 20 lakh to get incentives under the third iteration of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) India scheme.

“I strongly feel that the Make in India policies that the government has put in place, there should not be any reversal because now people have started investing in local manufacturing,” Motwani told PTI in an interaction.
If not followed diligently, the manufacturers would again shift to importing components from other countries including China, she added.
When asked if US carmaker Tesla should get policy support to enter the Indian market, Motwani said: “As far as the entry of some of the premium car makers like Tesla goes I don’t know the details about the proposal but I believe it’s linked to a large investment..But I still feel personally there should not be confusion and the policy should be consistent.

People should know that there is a policy in place and it needs to be followed, she noted.

“It shouldn’t be that one day you say that Make in India is important..and then you say that now duties are reduced. Policy should be long-term and consistent,” Motwani said.
India should definitely focus on Make in India because that will only create long-term competitiveness, she noted.
“Otherwise, we’ll end up becoming a country where there are EV users but materials for their production are coming from other countries,” she added.

Motwani said FICCI has also proposed to the government to cover small electric cars for incentives under the FAME scheme.
“FICCI has already given its recommendations to the Heavy Industries ministry for the FAME 3 scheme and said that now we should also consider private cars because there is genuine interest in the public. We are proposing an incentive for cars up to Rs 20 lakh only,” she noted.
The FAME India scheme, originally introduced on April 1, 2019, currently caters to public and commercial transport in the segments of electric three-wheelers, electric four-wheelers and electric buses.
The benefit of the incentive is also available to privately owned registered electric two-wheelers (e-2W).

Motwani stated that till the time battery prices come down considerably there is a need to continue with demand incentives for the next 3-5 years.

She noted that the time is now ripe to have deeper inter-ministerial dialogue regarding the EV segment.
“I think the time has come that we set up task forces in order to look at the next five years of ecosystem creation..assuming demand momentum is continued with demand incentives, then we need to also create an ecosystem with all the stakeholders involved,” Motwani said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ev-policy-ficci-electric-vehicles-kinetic-green-9061945/,business
"Consumers hopeful about income, employment but inflation a worry: RBI survey","“Respondents remained fairly optimistic on the one year ahead prospects for general economic situation, employment, income and spending,” the Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS), released by the RBI, showed.","Consumers are fairly optimistic about employment, income, spending and general economic situations, but see higher inflationary pressures across some major products, for the one year ahead, the latest surveys of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed.
Consumer confidence for the current period remained stable.

CSI and FEI are compiled on the basis of net responses on the economic situation, income, spending, employment and the price level for the current period (as compared with one year ago) and a year ahead, respectively.

Expectations regarding overall prices and inflation over the next three months were more aligned with those of food products and services. For the year ahead, such alignment is more pronounced with the prospects for food products and housing segments, the Households’ Inflation Expectations Survey showed.
Households’ perception of current inflation declined by 20 basis points (bps) from the previous survey round to 8.2 per cent in November 2023. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

The consumer price-based inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, eased to 4.9 per cent in October from 7.4 per cent in July. In the monetary policy announced on December 8, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the near-term outlook on inflation is masked by risks to food inflation which might lead to an inflation uptick in November and December.

RBI to bring digital loan aggregators under regulation,Digital lenders have been accused of charging high interest rates and using illegal recovery measures. There are hundreds of unauthorised digital lenders which are outside the RBI’s purview.,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to bring digital loan aggregators under a comprehensive regulatory framework to increase transparency in their operations.
Web aggregators bring together loan offers from multiple lenders on an electronic platform; borrowers can then pick and choose the best available loan option.
Digital lenders have been accused of charging high interest rates and using illegal recovery measures. There are hundreds of unauthorised digital lenders which are outside the RBI’s purview.
ADVERTISEMENT
The digital lending universe is classified into three groups: Entities regulated by the RBI and permitted to carry out lending business; entities authorised to carry out lending as per other statutory/regulatory provisions but not regulated by RBI; and entities lending outside the purview of any statutory/ regulatory provision.
The central bank’s regulatory framework is focused on the digital lending ecosystem of RBI’s regulated entities and the lending service providers engaged by them to extend various permissible credit facilitation services.
“As regards entities falling in the second category, the respective regulator or controlling authority may consider formulating or enacting appropriate rules and regulations on digital lending based on the recommendations of WGDL (working group on digital lending). For the entities in the third category, the WGDL has suggested specific legislative and institutional interventions for consideration by the Central Government to curb the illegitimate lending activity being carried out by such entities,” the RBI said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-to-bring-digital-loan-aggregators-under-regulation-9060497/,business
RBI to offer cloud storage services as part of digital public infrastructure,"The service, which will be developed by a subsidiary of the central bank, will directly compete with similar services offered by American companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is working on establishing a cloud facility for the financial sector in India as it looks to enhance the security, integrity and privacy of financial sector data. The service, which will be developed by a subsidiary of the central bank, will directly compete with similar services offered by American companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.
The regulator is taking the same approach as the government has done with setting up ‘digital public infrastructure’ (DPI) — where the underlying technology is built by the government, and is later outsourced to the private sector for developing various applications. The biometric identity programme Aadhaar and United Payments Interface (UPI) are key examples of DPI.

High vegetable prices may push up retail inflation in near term: RBI Governor,"“The near-term outlook is masked by risks to food inflation which might lead to an inflation uptick in November and December. This needs to be watched for second round effects, if any,” Das said.","Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das Friday said high frequency food price indicators “point to an increase in prices of key vegetables which may push retail inflation higher in the near-term”.
“The near-term outlook is masked by risks to food inflation which might lead to an inflation uptick in November and December. This needs to be watched for second round effects, if any,” Das said.
Going ahead, inflation outlook would be considerably influenced by uncertain food prices, Das said while announcing the monetary policy on Friday. “The ongoing rabi sowing progress for key crops like wheat, spices and pulses needs to be closely monitored. Elevated global sugar prices are also a matter of concern,” he said.

The Monetary Policy Committee has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent.
Das said global commodity prices, particularly, agricultural commodity prices, have softened, except for rice. For highly import dependent food items like edible oils, international prices continue to remain soft. Domestic milk prices are also stabilising, said Das. “Pro-active supply side interventions by the government are also containing domestic food price pressures. Crude oil has softened considerably, though it may remain volatile,” he said.
Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of normal monsoons, retail inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, Das said. It is expected to be at 5.6 per cent in Q3 and 5.2 per cent in Q4. Retail inflation for the first quarter of 2024-25 is projected at 5.2 per cent, Q2 at 4.0 per cent and Q3 at 4.7 per cent.
“We have made significant progress in bringing down inflation to below 5 per cent in October 2023 despite occasional blips due to intermittent supply shocks. The summer of 2022 is behind us,” Governor said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Inflation will start inching up because food inflation is going to increase. We have seen onion and tomato prices going up again. So, there is no case for even thinking of lowering the repo rate. At the same time, core inflation is around 4 per cent, and therefore, there is no reason for the RBI to increase the rate,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.
“Our policy of prioritising inflation over growth, hiking policy rate by 250 basis points in a calibrated manner and draining out excess liquidity have worked well, alongside supply-side measures taken by the government, to bring about this disinflation,” Das said.
“The fact that core inflation has also trended lower and household inflation expectations have become better anchored gives us the confidence and conviction that monetary policy is doing its job. On the other hand, growth remains resilient and robust, surprising everyone on the upside,” Das said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Notwithstanding this progress, the target of 4.0 per cent retail inflation is yet to be reached and we have to stay the course,” he said. Headline inflation continues to be volatile due to multiple supply side shocks which have become more frequent and intense.
RBI said the trajectory of food inflation needs to be closely monitored. Intermittent vegetable price shocks could once again push up headline inflation in November and December. While monetary policy would look-through such one-off shocks, it has to stay alert to the risk of such shocks becoming generalised and derailing the ongoing disinflation process. In the midst of these uncertainties, monetary policy has to remain actively disinflationary to ensure a durable alignment of headline inflation to the target rate of 4.0 per cent, while supporting growth, Das said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/high-vegetable-prices-may-push-up-retail-inflation-in-near-term-rbi-governor-9060481/,business

“The RBI took a balanced approach by raising the economic growth forecast and also expressing concern on food inflation, which may have an elevated trajectory in the short term.

Govt bans use of sugarcane juice/sugar syrup for ethanol making in 2023-24 supply year,The decision by the ministry comes in the backdrop of estimated fall in sugar production in 2023-24 marketing year (October-September).,"The Centre on Thursday banned the use of ‘sugacane juice and sugar syrup’ for ethanol production in the 2023-24 supply year that started this month, in order to maintain adequate sugar availability for domestic consumption and to keep prices under check.
However, the government has allowed use of ‘B-molasses’ for ethanol production in 2023-24, a move which sugar industry bodies welcomed.
In a letter issued to all sugar mills and distillers, the Food Ministry directed them “not to use sugarcane juice /sugar syrup” for ethanol production during the 2023-24 ethanol supply year (December-November). The directive was issued as per clause 4 and 5 of the Sugar (Control) Order 1966. “Supply of ethanol from existing offers received by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) from B-Heavy molasses will continue,” Food ministry said in the letter.

The decision by the ministry comes in the backdrop of estimated fall in sugar production in 2023-24 marketing year (October-September).
Welcoming the move, the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) Managing Director Pakash P Naiknavare said, “There is huge stock of ethanol made from B-molasses lying in the country apart from contracted quantities. The letter resolves the industry’s concern.” However, there are some ambiguity in the letter that states supply of ethanol from “existing offers” received by OMCs from B-Heavy molasses will continue. “Will it be withdrawn after the existing tender is over? There is no clarity,” he told PTI. Also, some units have been built for making ethanol from sugarcane juice and sugar syrup alone. These units will become sick if they remain unoperational, he added.
All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA) Chaiman Praful Vithalani said, “As per the order, B-molasses production shall continue against existing offer but it is not clear if it will continue for next B-molasses tender.” He also said the OMCs may not come with new tender for B-molasses ethanol till sugar situation is clear.
Industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has projected a 9 per cent fall in gross sugar production at 337 lakh tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting (October-September). It has not estimated the diversion of sugar for ethanol production.

“A better-than-estimated Q2 GDP growth, ease in global oil prices and drop in global bond yield will be the silver lining for the MPC. However, the expectation of a rise in domestic November inflation, drop in Rabi cultivation and increase in foodgrain prices will influence RBI to adopt a cautious approach in the short-term,” he said.

Thali prices rise by 5-10% in November: CRISIL,"The uptick was attributable to a substantial 58 per cent and 35 per cent on-month increase in onion and tomato prices, respectively, prompted by festive demand and lower output in the kharif season due to erratic rainfall conditions.","The cost of a representative, home-cooked vegetarian and non-vegetarian thali in November 2023, increased 10 per cent and 5 per cent on month, respectively, CRISIL MI&A Research said.
The uptick was attributable to a substantial 58 per cent and 35 per cent on-month increase in onion and tomato prices, respectively, prompted by festive demand and lower output in the kharif season due to erratic rainfall conditions.
On-month, the cost of the non-vegetarian thali increased at a slower pace than that of the vegetarian thali because of a marginal 1-3 per cent decline in prices of broilers, which account for 50 per cent of the non-vegetarian thali cost, CRISIL said. The cost of a non-vegetarian thali increased to Rs 61.2 in November 2023 from Rs 58.2 in October and vegetarian thali cost rose to Rs 30.3 from Rs 27.5 in October.
ADVERTISEMENT
The cost of the vegetarian thali rose 9 per cent on-year, driven by a 93 per cent and 15 per cent increase in onion and tomato prices, respectively. Prices of pulses, which account for 9 per cent of the vegetarian thali cost, also increased 21 per cent on-year.
The average cost of preparing a thali at home is calculated based on input prices prevailing in north, south, east and west India. Monthly change reflects the impact on the common man’s expenditure. The data also reveals the ingredients (cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil, cooking gas) driving changes in the cost of a thali, according to the rating agency.
A vegetarian thali comprises roti, vegetables (onion, tomato, and potato), rice, dal, curd, and salad. For non-vegetarian thali, the constituents remain same but for dal, which is replaced by chicken.
India’s retail inflation dropped to 4.87 per cent in October compared to 5.02 per cent in September, according to data from the ministry of statistics. The RBI’s monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is meeting this week, retained the Repo rate at 6.50 per cent in the October policy meeting.
ADVERTISEMENT
The rise in thali prices means a family of five would be incurring an additional cost of Rs 14 for preparing vegetarian thali and Rs 15 for non-vegetarian thali for lunch or dinner a day. If they prepare thali for both lunch and dinner, the additional cost per month will be Rs 840 for vegetarian thali and Rs 900 for non-vegetarian thali per household of five members.
The total cost of preparing a vegetarian thali for a five-member family will be Rs 4,545 per month and for non-vegetarian thali Rs 9,180 for either lunch or dinner.
Male agricultural workers in rural areas got an average daily wage of Rs 323.2 in India in 2022, according to RBI data. If they work for 20 days in a month, their monthly income will be around Rs 13,000 for two persons. If there’re two earning members in a household, 70 per cent of the wages will go towards preparing the vegetarian thali (both lunch and dinner) for the month. Expenses towards education, health, clothes, travel and energy will have to come from the balance 30 per cent. Households will have to compromise on the quality and richness of the daily meal and cut down food expenses to keep the family budget under control.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/thali-prices-rise-by-5-10-in-november-crisil-9057527/,business

In the original order, Air India had gone for six A350-900 and 34 A350-1000 planes.","Air India has rejigged its mega aircraft order with Airbus, increasing the number of the A321neo and A350-900 aircraft and reducing the number of A320neo and A350-1000 planes, even as the overall order size in terms of aircraft count remains the same at 250, as per the latest orders data released by Airbus for November.
Air India’s narrow-body order now stands at 140 A321neo aircraft (against 70 earlier) and 70 A320neo planes (against 140 earlier), the orders data shows. In the case of the 40 wide-body planes on order with Airbus, the airline now has a 50:50 split–20 each of A350-900 and A350-1000 aircraft. In the original order, Air India had gone for six A350-900 and 34 A350-1000 planes.
Large aircraft orders usually have provisions for such adjustments, which airlines can exercise due to various considerations like network planning, airport slot considerations, changes in passenger demand forecast, and delivery schedule, among others. Air India has so far not commented on its Airbus order rejig.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the airline said they regularly review their orderbook and exercise contractual flexibilities as appropriate. “We regularly review our orderbook based on business requirements and opportunities, and exercise contractual flexibilities as appropriate,” the spokesperson said.
Wide-body planes are usually deployed to operate long-haul and ultra-long-haul flights, while narrow-body aircraft are predominantly used for domestic flights, and can also be employed to operate short- and medium-haul international hops. The A321neo can carry more passengers and has a longer travel range than the A320neo. Similarly, the A350-1000 has a higher passenger-carrying capacity as well as range than the A350-900.
The A321neo order could include A321LR (long-range) and A321XLR (extra-long-range) aircraft, which would allow Air India to operate narrow-body flights to destinations beyond the range of its current narrow-body fleet. Airbus does not provide the sub-type order data for its A321neo range.
Air India’s 250-plane order with Airbus is part of the airline’s combined order for 470 aircraft, with the remaining 220 planes on order with Boeing. So far, there have been no changes in Air India’s Boeing order profile. The airline had ordered 190 narrow-body Boeing 737MAX aircraft and 30 wide-body planes–20 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777X aircraft.

The combined order for 470 planes was announced on February 14 and purchase agreements between Air India and the two aircraft manufacturers were inked in June at the Paris Air Show. Apart from the 470 planes that make up the firm order, the deals include options to buy another 370 planes–300 from Airbus and 70 from Boeing.
The aircraft will serve the revamped Air India group. The Tata group is currently in the process of consolidating its four airlines–Air India, Vistara, Air India Express, and AIX Connect (Air Asia India)–into a full-service carrier and a low-cost carrier. The full-service carrier, which will be formed with the merger of Air India and Vistara, will be called Air India, while the other two group airlines will merge to form the no-frills carrier, which will retain the Air India Express brand.
Ever since Air India returned to the Tata Group in January 2022, the new owners have been focussed on sprucing up the product offering, while also planning an extensive expansion for the airline. A five-year roadmap–Vihaan.AI–was prepared with the objective of substantially growing the airline’s network and fleet in a bid to put it on a “path to sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership”. The twin orders are a key element in that strategy.

GST evasion of Rs 1.51 lakh- crore detected till October; 71 notices to online gaming companies,"The government has amended the GST law, making it mandatory for overseas online gaming companies to register in India from October 1.","About Rs 1.51 lakh crore of tax evasion was detected by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities till October in the financial year 2023-24, with Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat among the states with the highest amount of evasion, data shared by the Finance Ministry in Parliament showed. As many as 71 show cause notices have been issued to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24, reply to another question by the ministry stated.
Meanwhile, under its special drive, GST authorities detected tax evasion of Rs 24,010 crore and 21,791 non-existent entities, another reply by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated. Out of the total 21,791 entities whose GST registrations were discovered to be non- existent, 11392 entities pertained to state tax jurisdictions and 10,399 entities pertained to CBIC jurisdiction. State authorities detected Rs 8,805 crore of tax evasion, while Central authorities detected evasion of Rs 15,205 crore during the special drive.
For the total GST evasion of Rs 1.51 lakh crore detected by central GST officers in the current fiscal (till October 2023), 154 persons were arrested. A recovery of Rs 18,541 crore has been made so far this fiscal, the ministry said. This compares with detection of over Rs 1.31 lakh crore as evasion in financial year 2022-23, with recovery of Rs 33,226 crore, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary.

To the other question in the Rajya Sabha by BJP MP Sushil Kumar Modi on the amount of tax evasion and number of show cause notices issued to online gaming companies, Chaudhary said: “71 show cause notices involving GST to the tune of Rs 1,12,332 cr have been issued to online gaming companies during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24 (up to October 2023). As these notices are pending adjudication, the respective GST demand is not yet determined under the provisions of CGST Act, 2017.”
The government has amended the GST law, making it mandatory for overseas online gaming companies to register in India from October 1. In August, the GST Council clarified that 28 per cent GST would be levied on the full value of bets placed on online gaming platforms. Since then, many gaming companies received either an intimation notice or a show cause notice for short payment of GST.
Amended legal provisions and rules for online gaming, horse racing and casinos came into effect from October 1, bringing into effect the 28 per cent GST at face value at entry level and mandatory registration for offshore online gaming companies in India. The online gaming companies claim they were paying taxes at the rate of 18 per cent as the games played on the platform were ‘games of skill’.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/gst-evasion-of-rs-1-51-lakh-crore-detected-till-october-71-notices-to-online-gaming-companies-9056122/,business
Indian economy to be third largest by 2030: S&P Global,"India is set to become the third-largest economy by 2030 and is expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the next three years, S&P Global Ratings said in its report ‘Global Credit Outlook 2024: New Risks, New Playbook’ released Monday. India’s growth path to become the third largest economy will depend on the […]","India is set to become the third-largest economy by 2030 and is expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the next three years, S&P Global Ratings said in its report ‘Global Credit Outlook 2024: New Risks, New Playbook’ released Monday. India’s growth path to become the third largest economy will depend on the “paramount test” of whether it can become the next global manufacturing hub moving away from being a services-led economy.
“India is set to become the third-largest economy by 2030, and we expect it will be the fastest growing major economy in the next three years. A paramount test will be whether India can become the next big global manufacturing hub, an immense opportunity. Developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy into a manufacturing-dominant one,” the report said.
As per S&P, India is expected to grow at 6.4 per cent in 2023-24 compared with 7.2 per cent in the previous financial year. The rating agency said the growth rate will remain at 6.4 per cent in 2024-25 before rising to 6.9 per cent next year and 7 per cent in 2026-27. In November, before the release of India’s GDP data, the rating agency had revised up the country’s growth forecast for financial year 2023-24 to 6.4 per cent from 6 per cent earlier and lowered the growth projection for financial year 2024-25 to 6.4 per cent from 6.9 per cent earlier.

At present, the Indian economy is the fifth largest ranked behind the US, China, Germany and Japan. With the Chinese economy slowing down, Asia-Pacific’s growth engine is expected to shift to South and Southeast Asia from China, the S&P report said. The rating agency has projected China’s GDP growth to slow to 4.6 per cent in 2024 (2023: 5.4 per cent), and then edge up to 4.8 per cent in 2025, and return to 4.6 per cent in 2026.
Last week, the national accounts data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) showed that the Indian economy grew 7.6 per cent in July-September, beating consensus estimates of near-7 per cent growth rate. The growth jump came mainly on the back of the rise in manufacturing growth, corporate profitability and investments while the services sector saw a moderation.
The S&P report said unlocking the labor market potential will largely depend upon upskilling workers and increasing female participation in the workforce, with both the factors then expected to enable India to realise its demographic dividend. “A booming domestic digital market could also fuel expansion in India’s high-growth startup ecosystem during the next decade, especially in financial and consumer technology. In the automotive sector, India is poised for growth, building on infrastructure, investment, and innovation,” it said.
With elections set to be held in 2024 in many emerging economies including Indonesia, India, South Africa, and Mexico, low levels of policy predictability can undermine investor sentiment and derail existing investment potential, the report said. Emerging markets still have work to do to reap a bonanza from the structural opportunities, for instance, enhancing policy visibility will be critical in attracting investments into these developing trends, it said.

Underling the risk from high interest rates on the broader global growth outlook, the report said structurally high interest rates, in the absence of structurally greater growth expectations, will constrain investment growth. “A sharp rise in investments will be hard to justify amid higher average cost of capital and interest rate burden–as interest rates are likely to remain higher than normal for some time–and without larger average expected returns (growth),” the report said.
For global growth, the rating agency outlined risks for 2024 from persistent tight and volatile financing conditions amid entrenched inflation, increasingly pressuring debt-service capacity of more vulnerable borrowers. A deeper and longer-than-expected recession in the largest economies could further dampen global growth. Persistent input-cost inflation and high energy prices, combined with weakening demand, squeeze corporate profits and pressure governments’ fiscal balances, it said. “Stresses in global real estate markets result in materially higher credit losses and spillovers to broader economies and markets; and amplifying geopolitical tensions roil markets and weigh on business conditions. Looking ahead at the structural risks that will shape the future of credit, we see greater pressure on credit from the physical and transition risks associated with climate change, along with rising systemic risks from cyberattacks,” it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/indian-economy-to-be-third-largest-by-2030-sp-global-9056093/,business

Fertiliser sales rise despite patchy monsoon,"The fertiliser subsidy, which amounted to Rs 81,124.33 crore in 2019-20, shot up to Rs 127,921.74 crore in 2020-21, Rs 153,758.10 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 251,339.35 crore in 2022-23, while budgeted at Rs 175,099.92 crore for the current fiscal.","Erratic monsoon may have hit tractor sales, which are down 3.8 per cent in April-October 2023 over April-October 2022 (from 6.11 lakh to 5.88 lakh units), as per industry data. However, sales of fertilisers are up, with the corresponding year-on-year growth at 7.5 per cent for urea, 17.9 per cent for di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), 6 per cent for muriate of potash (MOP), 5.4 per cent for single super phosphate and 22.7 per cent for complexes containing varying proportions of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S).
“Sales were good during this kharif season (May-July sowing and September-October harvesting), but we aren’t sure how much of it translated into actual field consumption. A clear picture will emerge only by March towards the end of the rabi season (October-December sowing and March-April harvesting),” N. Suresh Krishnan, chairman of the Fertiliser Association of India (FAI), told The Indian Express.

The southwest monsoon was patchy this year. While rainfall was 5.6 per cent below the historical average (technically “normal”) for the season (June-September) as a whole, it was poorly distributed both temporally (deficient in June and August) and spatially (subpar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Karnataka, western Maharashtra and Marathwada). The northeast monsoon season (October-December), too, has registered 11.5% below-average rain so far.

Krishnan pointed out that international prices of fertilisers and raw materials have fluctuated significantly in the last one year and more.
Landed prices of imported DAP, which peaked at $950-960 per tonne in July 2022, eased to $440 a year later, before climbing again to the current $595 levels. Prices of imported ammonia and phosphoric acid (intermediates for DAP) similarly touched $1,575 per tonne in April 2022 and $1,715 in July-September 2022 respectively. These crashed to $285 and $875 by July-August 2023, only to recover to $600 and $985 respectively now.
“The government has done well to insulate our farmers from global price volatility. The maximum retail price (MRP) of urea has remained at Rs 262 per bag, while also being maintained at Rs 1,350/bag for DAP, Rs 1,300-1,350/bag for 20:20:0:13 (a popular complex), Rs 1,470/bag for 10:26:26 and 12:32:16, and Rs 1,650/bag for MOP,” said Krishnan. A bag of urea contains 45 kg, while 50 kg for other fertilisers.

The Centre has ensured no MRP increases for farmers by providing for more subsidy to fertiliser companies for their higher production/import costs. The fertiliser subsidy, which amounted to Rs 81,124.33 crore in 2019-20, shot up to Rs 127,921.74 crore in 2020-21, Rs 153,758.10 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 251,339.35 crore in 2022-23, while budgeted at Rs 175,099.92 crore for the current fiscal.

The industry wants the higher subsidy, now mainly given on urea and DAP, to be extended to MOP and complexes containing K. “Among non-urea fertilisers, the highest MRP normally was that of DAP, followed by 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 20:20:0:13 and finally MOP. That price hierarchy has been disturbed, with MOP and other K-containing fertilisers currently retailing higher than DAP. It needs correction,” added Krishnan.

Agriculture scientists consider the ideal N:P:K use ratio for Indian soils at 4:2:1. As against this, the actual ratio during the kharif 2023 season was assessed at 10.9:4.9:1.

Online gaming lobby groups sign voluntary code of ethics,"In April, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) had notified rules for online gaming which allowed for the setting up of self-regulatory bodies to vet the legitimacy of online games, with oversight of the government, among other provisions.","Three major lobby groups representing top online gaming companies including Dream11 and Games24x7 have co-signed a code of ethics as the industry attempts to govern itself amid a turbulent time after having faced harsh action on the taxation side. The code, however, is voluntary in nature, meaning that it is not legally binding.
The three lobby groups that are co-signatories to the the voluntary code are the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), E-Gaming Federation (EGF) and the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF), which represent a majority of the online real money gaming companies operating in India. It is worth noting that the IAMAI is headed by Harsh Jain, the co-founder of Dream11.

As per the code, online gaming companies will undertake know-your-customer (KYC) as per applicable laws. To separate themselves from gambling firms, the code says that online gaming companies will specify on their sites the manner of determination of winners, the platform fee charged, and ensuring that deposits for online gaming services are utilised only for playing games on the platform.
In April, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) had notified rules for online gaming which allowed for the setting up of self-regulatory bodies to vet the legitimacy of online games, with oversight of the government, among other provisions. These rules were notified after recommendations by an inter-ministerial task force.

Rupee settles 1 paisa higher at 83.37 against US dollar,RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to begin its three-day deliberations on December 6. Das would unveil the decision of the six-member MPC on December 8.,"The rupee recovered from all-time low levels to settle up by 1 paisa at 83.37 against the US dollar in a restricted trade on Tuesday amid a stronger American currency in overseas markets and disappointing services sector data.
Forex traders said the rupee traded in a narrow range as positive domestic markets and crude oil prices trading below the USD 80 per barrel mark cushioned the downside.
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at its all-time low level of 83.41 against the greenback.

The local unit oscillated between an intra-day low of 83.41 and a high of 83.37 against the greenback and finally settled at 83.37 (provisional) against the dollar, higher by 1 paisa from its previous close, even as domestic benchmark indices touched new lifetime peaks.
On Monday, the rupee settled at 83.38 against the US dollar despite domestic benchmark stock indices rallying to lifetime high levels.
“We expect Rupee to trade with a slight negative bias on positive US dollar and weak global markets. However, expectations of fresh foreign fund inflows and a weak tone in crude oil prices may support rupee at lower levels,” said Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
Traders may take cues from US ISM services PMI and JOLTS job openings data. Investors may remain cautious ahead of RBI’s monetary policy decision later this week. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 83.10 to 83.70, Choudhary said.

"Moody’s cuts China credit outlook to negative, cites lower growth, property risks","The downgrade reflects growing evidence that authorities will have to provide financial support for debt-laden local governments and state firms, posing broad risks to China's fiscal, economic and institutional strength, Moody's said in a statement.","Ratings agency Moody’s on Tuesday cut its outlook on China’s government credit ratings to negative from stable, citing lower medium-term economic growth and risks from a major correction in the country’s vast property sector.
The downgrade reflects growing evidence that authorities will have to provide financial support for debt-laden local governments and state firms, posing broad risks to China’s fiscal, economic and institutional strength, Moody’s said in a statement.
“The outlook change also reflects the increased risks related to structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth and the ongoing downsizing of the property sector,” Moody’s said.

The move by Moody’s was its first change on its China view since it cut its rating by one notch to A1 in 2017, also citing expectations of slowing growth and rising debt.
While Moody’s affirmed China’s A1 long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings on Tuesday, it said it expects the country’s annual GDP growth to slow to 4.0% in 2024 and 2025, and to average 3.8% from 2026 to 2030.
Most analysts believe the economy is on track to hit the government’s annual growth target of around 5% this year, but activity is highly uneven.
The world’s second-biggest economy has struggled to mount a strong post-COVID recovery as a deepening crisis in the housing market, local government debt risks, slow global growth and geopolitical tensions have dented momentum. A flurry of policy support measures have proven only modestly beneficial, raising pressure on authorities to roll out more stimulus.

Local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.6 trillion), or 76% of China’s economic output in 2022, up from 62.2% in 2019, according to the latest data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
After years of over-investment in infrastructure, plummeting returns from land sales, and soaring costs to battle COVID-19, economists say debt-laden municipalities now represent a major risk to the economy.
China’s Finance Ministry said it was disappointed by Moody’s downgrade, adding that the economy will maintain its rebound an positive trend. It also said property and local government risks are controllable.

“Moody’s concerns about China’s economic growth prospects, fiscal sustainability and other aspects are unnecessary,” the ministry said.
In October, China unveiled a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139.84 billion) in sovereign bonds by the end of the year to help kick-start activity, raising the 2023 budget deficit target to 3.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) from the original 3%.

"Markets continue gains for second day after BJP wins: Sensex crosses 69,000 mark, Nifty at new high",The BJP’s victory has raised the market’s expectation of political stability after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.,"Indian equities continue to surge for the second straight session on Tuesday, with the Sensex crossing the 69,000 mark for the first time, buoyed by hopes of continuity of the existing government at the Centre after the Lok Sabha elections next year.
The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensex opened at a record high of 69,168.53. The index gained 303.41 points, or 0.44 per cent, compared to the previous close of 68,865.12. The National Stock Exchange’s Nifty climbed 122.1 points, or 0.59 per cent, to open at a new high of 20,808.9.
On Monday, the Sensex and Nifty recorded the biggest single-day rally in over a year.

Heavy buying by investors since Monday is due to the strong showing by the BJP in the state election results, in which it won in three of the five states. The BJP’s victory has raised the market’s expectation of political stability after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
“The super Monday, which delivered a 418-point rally in the Nifty, is unlikely to be repeated with the same ferocity in the coming days. But the market construct stays bullish,” said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
He said the market has the potential to go up by another 5 per cent in the next few weeks. Beyond that, valuations will get stretched, inviting correction in the market, he added.
“With the outcome overwhelmingly in favor of the incumbent BJP, the confidence of the market in the current dispensation and political continuity post 2024 Lok Sabha elections will get a boost. This augurs well for macro and policy momentum for India, which, at the moment, is seeing the highest growth among major economies (both GDP as well as corporate earnings),” Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report.

Better-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.6 per cent in the July-September quarter, higher inflows from foreign institutional investors and hopes of an early rate cut by the US Federal Reserve has already boosted the investor’s sentiments.
The massive institutional buying of above Rs 7,000 crore on Monday reflects institutional confidence in the Indian market, Vijayakumar said, adding that foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) have reversed their selling strategy and have been consistent buyers during the last seven days.

"Over half of FY23 bank loan write-offs linked to large industries, services sector","The total defaulted loans (including write-offs but excluding loans recovered from write-offs in three years) amount to Rs 10.32 lakh crore, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations.","Over half of the total loans written off by Scheduled Commercial Banks in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) belonged to large industries and services sector, as per data presented by the Ministry of Finance in Parliament on Monday.
A total of Rs 2.09 lakh crore worth of loans were written off by banks in FY23, out of which 52.3 per cent were linked to large industries and services, Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat Karad said in response to a question in the Lok Sabha.
In the previous year, there was a dip in total written-off loans to Rs 1.75 lakh crore, out of which 39.8 per cent accrued to the large industries and te services sector. A closer look at the data for the last five years shows that the share of large industries and services was the highest at 62.3 per cent out of the total written-off loans amounting to Rs 2.03 lakh crore in 2020-21.

In July this year, The Indian Express through information received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Right to Information Act had reported that banks had written off bad loans worth over Rs 2.09 lakh crore during the year ended March 2023, taking the total loan write-off by the banking sector to Rs 10.57 lakh crore in the last five year.
This huge loan write-off aided banks to bring down gross non-performing assets (GNPA) – or loans defaulted by borrowers — to a 10-year low of 3.9 per cent of advances in March 2023. Gross NPAs of banks had fallen from Rs 10.21 lakh crore in FY2018 to Rs 5.55 lakh crore by March 2023, mainly on the back of loan write-offs by banks.
Banks have written off a whopping Rs 15,31,453 crore since FY2012-13, as per RBI data. However, what is to be noted is that loans written off by banks will remain in the books of banks as unrecovered loans. The central bank RTI reply had said that the banks recovered only Rs 1.09 lakh crore from Rs 5.87 lakh loans written off in the last three years, revealing that they could only recover 18.60 per cent of the write-offs during the three-year period.
The total defaulted loans (including write-offs but excluding loans recovered from write-offs in three years) amount to Rs 10.32 lakh crore, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations. Including write-offs, the total NPA ratio would have become 7.47 per cent of advances as against 3.9 per cent reported by the banks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/over-half-of-fy23-bank-loan-write-offs-linked-to-large-industries-services-sector-9054593/,business

"India’s international air passenger volumes touch pre-pandemic levels in H1 FY24, domestic airlines gain market share","In all, the three Tata group airlines--Air India, Air India Express, and Vistara--had a combined market share of 23.5 per cent in terms of international passengers ferried in H1 FY24, higher than that of IndiGo.","India’s international air passenger traffic appears to have finally shrugged off the COVID-19 baggage, achieving pre-pandemic levels in the first half (H1) of the current financial year. The number of total international flyers travelling from and to India was 3.14 crore in April-September, a tad higher than 3.13 crore passengers in the corresponding six months of 2019–the last full half-year period of regular operations before the pandemic froze the aviation industry–shows an analysis of data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
Since early 2022, even as the international air travel to and from India was on a path of healthy recovery, it lagged the rapid pace of normalisation in domestic passenger traffic. In H1 of 2022-23 (FY23), the cumulative international passenger count to and from India was 2.47 crore, around 21 per cent lower than the corresponding period of FY20.
Interestingly, the return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic has been accompanied by a notable shift in India’s international aviation landscape with a jump in the cumulative market share (by passengers carried) of Indian carriers vis-à-vis foreign airlines, the DGCA data shows. Although foreign airlines still account for a majority of passenger traffic flying into and out of India, the cumulative market share of domestic carriers registered a nearly 9-percentage-point jump in market share from 2019 levels.
ADVERTISEMENT
The combined market share of Indian carriers by passengers carried on international flights was 44.3 per cent in April-September this year, up from 35.4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019, and 43.7 per cent in H1 of FY23. Of the total of 3.14 crore commuters who flew into or out of India in H1 of the current financial year, Indian airlines carried 1.39 crore passengers.
Leading this expansion in market share, primarily, are IndiGo and Vistara. Air India, which was under government control in 2019 and is now part of the Tata group, also registered an increase in international market share.
On the other hand, financially-stressed SpiceJet registered a contraction in international market share. Go First’s market share crashed as the Wadia group carrier suspended operations from early May as it filed for bankruptcy. Air India’s no-frills arm Air India Express saw a marginal decline in market share.
Market share data for the April-September periods of FY21 and FY22 have not been considered as regular international flights had not resumed at the time and bilateral air bubble arrangements were in place.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to industry watchers, fuelling this surge in international market share are: network expansion and higher capacities deployed on international routes by carriers like IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India, slower recovery in capacity deployment by some foreign carriers, and reduction in flights by various North American airlines to avoid Russian airspace due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Market leader IndiGo’s share surged to 17.8 per cent in April-September of FY24 from 10.3 per cent four years back, and 15.7 per cent a year ago.
Vistara’s market share rose to 3.2 per cent in H1 FY24 from 0.1 per cent in the corresponding period of FY20. It is worth noting that the airline had launched international flights in the July-September quarter of FY20, which explains the extremely low base. In April-September of last year, Vistara’s international market share was 1.9 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Air India’s international market share expanded to 12.6 per cent in H1 of the current financial year from 11.4 per cent four years ago, and 12.2 per cent a year back. Air India Express, however, regsitered a market share of 7.7 per cent in the six months ended September 2023, against 7.8 per cent in the corresponding period of FY20, and 8 per cent in H1 of the last financial year.
In all, the three Tata group airlines–Air India, Air India Express, and Vistara–had a combined market share of 23.5 per cent in terms of international passengers ferried in H1 FY24, higher than that of IndiGo.
In April-September of this year, the embattled SpiceJet’s market share contracted to 2.6 per cent from 4.3 per cent four years ago, and 3.6 per cent a year ago. Go First, which has not taken to the skies since early May, had a market share of 1.3 per cent in H1 FY20 and 2.3 per cent in the April-September of last year. In the first half of the current financial year, the airline ferried just 90,940 passengers on its international flights (almost entirely in April), accounting for merely 0.3 per cent of India’s overall international passenger count for the six-month period.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/indias-international-air-passenger-volumes-touch-pre-pandemic-levels-in-h1-fy24-domestic-airlines-gain-market-share-9054583/,business

Banks’ exposure to NBFCs jumps 3.8 times from early 2018 levels; MFs cut exposure by 31.4%,MFs’ exposure to NBFCs fell from Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 1.58 lakh crore by October 2023.,"Bank lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) jumped by around 3.8 times in around five-and-a-half years even as mutual funds cut exposure to NBFCs by 31.4 per cent to mitigate risk.
The credit exposure of banks to NBFCs stood at Rs 14.8 lakh crore in October 2023, indicating a 22.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) growth. NBFC exposure of banks was just Rs 3.90 lakh crore in February 2018, registering a rise of 279 per cent in over five-and-a-half years. This expansion is indicative of the robust progress observed in NBFCs during the post-pandemic period, according to CareEdge Ratings report.
MFs’ exposure to NBFCs fell from Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 1.58 lakh crore by October 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
Interestingly, MF exposure to NBFCs as a share of debt assets under management (AUM) has reduced from nearly 20 per cent in the later part of 2018 to around 11 per cent. On the other hand, the share of banks’ advances to NBFCs as a share of aggregate advances has doubled from around 4.5 per cent in February 2018 to close to 9.6 per cent in October 2023, the report said.
The credit extended by banks to NBFCs has exhibited a consistent upward trend over the last five years and continued its acceleration along with the phased reopening of economies after the Covid-19 pandemic. This growth momentum further accelerated during FY23 and has continued in first half of FY24.
Further, after the merger of HDFC Limited with HDFC Bank, the quantum of outstanding exposure of banks to NBFCs had reduced sequentially, albeit maintaining the y-o-y growth rate. In September 2023, the quantum of outstanding exposure reached the pre-merger level and in October 2023 moved past the same, the report said.
The RBI has prescribed an increase in risk weights for advances to AAA-A-rated NBFCs by 25 per cent, while higher risk weights would not be applicable for entities in the BBB+ and below rating categories. This excludes the risk weights for bank loans to HFCs or bank loans backed by PSL loans. Further, around 40-50 per cent of the current outstanding would fall in this category meanwhile as the notification is silent on covering the outstanding loans or whether only fresh loans would be subject to these norms, the report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Furthermore, the proportion of NBFC exposure in relation to aggregate credit has risen from 9.4 per cent in October 2022 to 9.6 per cent in October 2023. On a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis, the amount rose by 4.0 per cent.
Meanwhile, the MF debt exposure to NBFCs, including Commercial Papers (CPs) and corporate debt, witnessed an increase of 21.9 per cent to Rs 1.58 lakh crore in October 2023, while declining sequentially by 10.5 per cent from September 2023.
Highlighting the relative size of their exposure to NBFCs, MFs’ debt exposure to NBFCs remained at 10.7 per cent as a percentage of “Banks’ advances to NBFCs” in October 2023 and October 2022, but declined sequentially from 12.5 per cent in September 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/banks-exposure-to-nbfcs-jumps-3-8-times-from-early-2018-levels-mfs-cut-exposure-by-31-4-9054590/,business

"Tailwinds boost Q2 growth, but multiple headwinds loom ahead","IDFC FIRST Bank’s Economist Gaura Sengupta said the deflator, with a higher weight of WPI, was favourable for manufacturing than the services sector, which has a higher weight of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation.","GOING BEYOND the headline number, the stellar second quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) number presents a mixed bag of sorts: unexpected tailwinds that aided growth during the three month period, and some potential headwinds going forward.
Improved corporate profitability driven by the slide in input prices, a sharp surge in construction activity helped mainly by government-led capital expenditure, alongside some deflator-related issues in accounting — these were some of the factors which were underestimated by most economists in their GDP estimates for the July-September quarter. The result — a stellar 7.6 per cent growth rate, which has prompted most economists to revise up their growth forecast for FY24, even as they underlined the perceptible moderation in private consumption and concerns of a slowdown in the remaining half of the financial year (October-March).

"The big fat Indian wedding: cheaper hotels & flights, visa-free deals drive business overseas",Garg explained that affluent families prefer to host weddings with a small guest list in faraway locations where social obligations become less important.,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to “big families” to host weddings in India as opposed to conducting them overseas comes amid a sharp recovery in outbound tourism to countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, which are also popular choices for Indian destination weddings. As per a recent McKinsey report, outbound tourism in India has recorded much quicker recovery than most Asian countries, touching 61 per cent of the pre-pandemic market. Notably, the recovery has happened despite a hike in TCS rates for overseas expenditure that became effective from October this year. With rising disposable income, expensive domestic hotel prices, and countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka removing visa restrictions for Indian tourists, couples getting hitched are increasingly looking outwards to host their weddings.
“Doing a wedding in Thailand is definitely cheaper than doing a wedding in a good hotel in Rajasthan or Goa. However, it’s not very cheap. The hotels there [in Thailand] are cheaper, but everything else is probably equal or more expensive,” Samit Garg, president of Event & Entertainment Management Association (EEMA), which represents over four hundred event management-linked companies across the country, told The Indian Express. Garg estimated a total of 500 big-ticket overseas destination weddings in 2023, a figure that matches pre-pandemic levels. Firm estimates of Indian travelling abroad for weddings are unavailable.

Grounded airline Go First’s CEO Kaushik Khona resigns,"The company has significant value but unfortunately, the Resolution Professional (RP) has not found anyone who can take this forward, Kaushik Khona said.","Grounded Go First’s CEO Kaushik Khona has put in his papers, nearly seven months after the no-frills airline filed for insolvency proceedings.
In an e mail to the airline’s employees on Thursday, Khona said that November 30 is his last day at the company.
Khona had returned to Go First in August 2020 as its CEO.

“With a heavy heart, I have to inform that today is my last day with the company. I got an opportunity to work for Go FIRST once again in August 2020 and with your able and active support I tried to perform to my best abilities,” Khona said in the e mail.
Earlier, he was with the carrier from 2008 to 2011.
“… the Board of Directors decided to file for Section 10 application under the IBC and we still continued to provide the best support to the company… We were hopeful that we will resume the operations soon and at least from June 2023 but it got delayed” he said in the e mail accessed by PTI.
Section 10 pertains to voluntary insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
According to him, all the employees of the airline worked with “sincere dedication” to get the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approval for the resumption of operations after they conducted a detailed audit for all operations and aircraft.

"Petrol, diesel price revision viable for OMCs only when crude stabilises at sub-$80 levels: Officials","As per the pricing methodology that these oil marketing companies (OMCs) are supposed to follow, petrol and diesel prices should be revised daily based on the 15-day rolling average of international benchmark prices.","Public sector fuel retailers will be in a position to take a call on resuming the daily revision of petrol and diesel prices once international crude oil prices stabilise under $80 per barrel, according to senior industry officials. As international oil and fuel prices continue to remain highly volatile, the companies are exercising caution as they do not want to pass on the price volatility to consumers, a top official with one of the three companies said.
The three companies — Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) — have not revised pump prices at their end since early April of last year, when global crude oil and fuel prices had surged in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The primary objective of halting fuel price revisions was to shield the Indian economy from skyrocketing energy prices globally. A jump in fuel prices would have led to significantly higher inflation in India, as was seen in countries that did allow a pass-through of high energy prices.

"AI could imperil salaries, not jobs; Why findings of new ECB study contrast with outcomes of previous tech waves","In general white-collar workers, and workers in advanced economies in general, are projected to be at a greater risk than blue collar workers in developing countries.","Waves of innovation in artificial intelligence have revived the debate on the impact of new technologies on employment. And while the jury is still out on how these newer innovations will play out, new research published by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) has said the adoption of AI could reduce wages, but so far is creating, not devouring jobs. But there are caveats: the conclusion of this latest Europe-focused study is more pronounced in the category of the young and highly-skilled workers in what is clearly a developed market setting, with the paper primarily looking at the deep learning boom of the 2010s.
The conclusion here is that occupations potentially more exposed to AI-enabled technologies actually increased their employment share in Europe and that jobs with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers gained the most. For salaries, it said that the evidence is “less clear and suggests neutral to slightly negative impacts”. “These results do not amount to an acquittal,” the paper noted. “AI-enabled technologies continue to be developed and adopted. Most of their impact on employment and wages – and therefore on growth and equality – has yet to be seen,” said the paper published by the ECB in a Research that was authored by Stefania Albanesi of the University of Pittsburgh and the NBER, and others.

This assumes significance for New Delhi as its public stockholding (PSH) programme was challenged by large food grain exporters such as the US and Canada on the grounds that it is highly subsidised, especially for rice, and that this is distorting the global foodgrain market. India is the largest rice exporter in the world.

Labour force refers to the part of the population, which supplies or offers to supply labour for pursuing economic activities for the production of goods and services and, therefore, includes both employed and unemployed persons.
The NSSO launched PLFS in April 2017.
On the basis of PLFS, a quarterly bulletin is brought out giving estimates of labour force indicators namely unemployment rate, Worker Population Ratio (WPR), Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), distribution of workers by broad status in employment and industry of work in CWS.
The estimates of unemployed persons in CWS give an average picture of unemployment in a short span of seven days during the survey period.
In the CWS approach, a person is considered unemployed if he/she did not work even for one hour on any day during the week but sought or was available for work at least for one hour on any day during the period.
Labour force, according to CWS, is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on average in a week preceding the date of the survey. LFPR is defined as the percentage of the population in the labour force.

Rising respiratory illness in China sparks demand concern among exporters,This comes at a time when India’s goods exports have seen a steep decline this year on account of weak demand from Europe and the United States due to high-interest rates following the Russia-Ukraine war and the geo-political tensions in the Middle East with the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.,"Rising cases of respiratory illnesses in China, India’s fourth largest export market, could hit already slowing consumption demand and disrupt critical raw material supply such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Electronic Integrated Circuits (EICs), crucial for India’s fast-growing electronic and pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, exporters said.

Beijing bourse tells ‘major shareholders’ to refrain from selling: Report,The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not reply to a request for comment.,"The Beijing Stock Exchange has de facto implemented a new policy that prevents major shareholders of companies listed on the bourse from selling stock, worried that such sales could douse a long-desired rally, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The bourse said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday that talk of such a policy was “not factual”, and there was “no change to the spirit of relevant published guidelines”.
A “major shareholder” is one with a stake of 5% or more and is required to make a public filing with the relevant stock exchange before selling shares, according to rules for China’s bourses.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Beijing exchange has been rejecting those filings, said the people who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
It was not immediately clear how long this new policy would remain in place, they added.
The Beijing Stock Exchange, launched two years ago, was set up to help facilitate funding for innovative small companies, dubbed “little giants”, but had languished due to lack of investor interest.
But its benchmark 50 Index has surged 46% this month on the back of recent measures by authorities. These include lowering the required amount of funds an investor must have in their stock account to invest, improving trading mechanisms and encouraging mutual funds to participate in the market.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bourse had said separately in a statement on Monday morning ahead of this Reuters article that it was closely monitoring trading to ensure normal market order.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not reply to a request for comment.
The so-called window guidance – where directives are made orally without written documents – is aimed at protecting the rally, the sources said.
ADVERTISEMENT
One noted that without the guidance, the share price surge “could prompt institutional shareholders to reduce their holdings which could knock the index down again.”
The Beijing bourse currently houses 232 companies with a combined market capitalisation of 366 billion yuan ($50 billion).
By comparison, the Shanghai bourse is home to 2,256 firms worth 47 trillion yuan in total, while almost 3,000 companies listed in Shenzhen have a total market capitalisation of 31.9 trillion yuan. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 0.4% this month, while the Shenzhen Composite Index is down 0.8%.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/beijing-bourse-major-shareholders-refrain-selling-report-9045284/,business

Tesla on two wheels? Ola Electric feels the strains of success,"Bhavish Aggarwal's Ola Electric, which he likens to Tesla in the West, is zipping towards a stock-market listing after going from zero to 338,000 e-scooter sales in about two years.","Bhavish Aggarwal, India’s answer to Elon Musk, is racing to roll out millions of electric scooters and speed his nation to a cleaner future. Some of his mechanics can’t keep up, though.
Aggarwal’s Ola Electric, which he likens to Tesla in the West, is zipping towards a stock-market listing after going from zero to 338,000 e-scooter sales in about two years. The tech entrepreneur vows to banish the internal combustion engine (ICE) from India, where two-wheel vehicles rule the roads.
Bhavish Aggarwal (Photo via his Twitter page)
We will “end the ICE age”, the 38-year-old told Reuters ahead of the launch of new Ola e-scooters starting at about $1,000 on Aug. 15, Indian Independence day. He said the company, already valued at $5.4 billion, would quadruple its annual production capacity to 2 million e-scooters by early new year.
Yet Ola’s rapid ride faces a few potholes.
ADVERTISEMENT
Parts of the company’s nationwide network of over 400 service hubs which maintain and repair its EVs are showing signs of strain after the surge in sales, according to Reuters visits to 35 centres in 10 states between July and October, plus interviews with 36 Ola service staff and 40 customers.
Staff at more than half of those centres, mainly sites in the big metropolitan areas of Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, said they had significant backlogs, with demand outstripping their workforce or their supply of spare parts, and repair waiting times ranging from three days to two weeks.
At an Ola workshop in Thane, among the biggest of the 14 centres in the Mumbai region, more than 100 e-scooters awaiting repairs were visible outside in a clearing, many parked in a muddy clearing gathering dust and littered with bird droppings.
Devendra Ghuge, a Thane service manager, told Reuters in late October that the number of cases the centre dealt with had risen from 200-300 to roughly 1,000 a month over the previous four months, with waiting times stretching up to two weeks.
ADVERTISEMENT
In January, Ola founder and CEO Aggarwal had pledged that customers would be able to bring their vehicles into a hub and receive same-day service in most cases.
In the August interview, he said customers were “voting with their wallets every month” by snapping up Ola EVs. But he acknowledged service capacity issues and said Ola was “aggressively” bolstering its service network by adding 100 new centres and hiring more technicians.
“We have the highest number of products on the market … and we do have a scale-up required in our service network,” he said. An Ola spokesperson said the Reuters reporting didn’t accurately capture the scale and quality of the company’s robust and growing service operations.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ravi Bhatia of auto consulting firm JATO Dynamics said a good service network was critical in India, the world’s biggest two-wheeler market. Indians are new to tech-packed EVs that can be more sensitive to bumps and bashes than many conventional scooters and motorbikes, he added.
India can indeed pose tough driving conditions, and two-wheelers are used by hundreds of millions of people to navigate roads that are often congested and riddled with potholes. Ola needs “to build the infrastructure for service accordingly, otherwise word-of-mouth will bite them,” Bhatia said.
‘Tesla for West, Ola for rest’
Aggarwal often declares, “Tesla is for the West, Ola for the rest”, and he’s a man in a hurry.
He says all new scooters and motorbikes sold in India could be electric by the end of 2025, a goal way ahead of the government’s target of 70% of new two-wheeler sales being EVs by 2030.

Two years since Ola’s first e-scooter rolled off the line, the startup has established itself as the leader in India’s two-wheeler EV market, with about a third of sales by volume. It has attracted marquee investors including Japan’s SoftBank and Singapore’s Temasek and is gearing up for a $700 million Indian IPO.
Industry data shows sales of e-scooters nearly tripled to over 700,000 in the year to March versus the previous year, thanks to Ola and also rivals like Hero Electric and TVS Motor .
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet those sales were still a fraction of the 5.2 million new scooters and 10.2 million motorbikes sold in India, where EV adoption significantly lags countries like the U.S. and China, and charging infrastructure is in its infancy.
How to ride e-scooters
Ghuge, the manager at Ola’s Thane workshop, said reported service issues included battery drainages, software glitches and damaged wires. He put much of the service surge down to the fact Indians were inexperienced in driving e-scooters on the country’s often poorly maintained roads, adding that many vehicles had been damaged after slipping on roads during monsoon season.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Electric vehicles are new to people so they aren’t aware of how to ride the vehicle to maximise optimal output,” he said.
Customer Khubeb Koradia, 25, said the Thane centre took three weeks to fix software-related issues after his EV broke down in September. The workshop “looked like a scooter graveyard” he said, referring to the scores of vehicles parked outside.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the Ola centre in the city of Kochi, service manager Ronald Radhakrishnan told Reuters in August that its 17 staff were “unable to handle demand for repairs”. Dozens of vehicles were parked outside the workshop, with some also in an area being used to park scooters across the road.
‘Gone through the roof’
Some customers have found it tough to book a repair slot.
Koradia shared a video with Reuters showing his attempt to book a slot on Oct. 31 for an e-scooter overheating problem. Seven of the nearest eight service centres to him in Mumbai rejected his request for repairs with the same message: “All slots for this location are full for the next few days.”
Hundreds of other Ola customers have also complained online about repair times or difficulties in finding servicing slots, according to a review of social media posts.
Aggarwal is bullish about his business, though, saying last month his sales had “gone through the roof” in India’s festive season, with an e-scooter being sold every 10 seconds.
During his Reuters interview, he dismissed much of the online outcry on service issues as “mudslinging” by rivals, without elaborating. “A lot of what you hear and see need not actually be the truth,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ola-electric-feels-the-strains-of-success-9045048/,business
Global goods trade recovering driven by EV sales: WTO,"India’s goods exports in October also registered an uptick with a 6.2 per cent rise, only the second jump in the ongoing financial year.","The global merchandise trade is on the mend, driven by automobile sales and electronic components trade, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in its quarterly Goods Trade Barometer report released on Monday.
The apex trade body said that the current reading of 100.7 for the barometer index is above the previous reading of 99.1 from last August.

Solar capacity installations in India fall 47 pc to 5.6 GW during Jan-Sep: Report,The utility-scale installations dropped more than 54 per cent year-over-year (YoY) to 4.2 GW.,"India has reported a 47 per cent fall in solar installations at 5.6 GW during January-September 2023, amid delay in project execution, according to research firm Mercom India.
The installations were also down in the July-September quarter this year at 1.9 GW, a 34 per cent fall, over 2.8 GW solar capacity installed in the same period a year ago, the research firm said.
However, on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, the installations increased almost 6 per cent compared to 1.8 GW in Q2 2023.
“During the first nine months of 2023, 5.6 GW of solar was installed in India. Solar capacity additions fell nearly 47 per cent compared to 10.5 GW installed in 9M 2022,” Mercom India Solar Market Update report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The utility-scale installations dropped more than 54 per cent year-over-year (YoY) to 4.2 GW.
“Barring significant negative developments, installations in 2024 should grow exponentially. Declining prices (of ped products) are now the cause of slower growth (compared to rising prices earlier) as developers and installers push procurement to the last minute. Hopefully, the market can handle the expected rush in Q1 2024 and thrive,” Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group said.
The extensions granted to several large-scale solar and hybrid power projects and those facing delays due to land and transmission issues primarily affected installations in January-September 2023.
The oversupply of modules in China further lowered the average selling prices of solar modules, which have fallen consecutively over the last four quarters.
ADVERTISEMENT
The challenges in securing transmission connectivity increased further with the change in project timelines. During Q3, the project developers also lacked clarity on application procedures under the amended regulations for long-term access to transmission networks.
However, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issued clarifications towards the quarter’s end, which is expected to ease the process over the next few quarters. Several projects stuck in the habitat of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) are still waiting for the Supreme Court order to receive transmission connectivity.
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity, including total rooftop solar installations, surpassed 69 GW as of September 2023.
The country’s utility-scale solar development pipeline stood at nearly 77 GW as of September 2023, and over 68 GW of projects tendered were pending auction at the end of Q3 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
sRajasthan remained the leading state for cumulative large-scale solar installations, adding nearly 17 GW at the end of Q3 2023, accounting for over 28 per cent. Karnataka and Gujarat came in next with almost 16 per cent and 11 per cent share, respectively.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/solar-capacity-installations-india-fall-jan-sep-report-9044148/,business

"Economists estimate Q2 GDP growth rate at 6.7-7% on services, govt capex progress","ICRA, which estimates Q2 GDP growth at 7 per cent topping the Monetary Policy Committee's forecast of 6.5 per cent, said growth may slow down in the second half of the financial year ahead of the elections as the impact of slowing capex and tempering of demand because of monetary tightening shows through in full.","A pickup in services, strong government-led capital expenditure and an uptick in consumption-oriented sectors, especially high-end consumption, has supported growth in the July-September quarter, with economists pegging Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate at 6.7-7 per cent. Though growth rate is seen slowing down sequentially from the first quarter’s (April-June) growth rate of 7.8 percent amid concerns over external demand, domestic consumption demand and services in totality are likely to have contributed the maximum share to the growth for the second quarter.
Closer to the data release of the Q2 GDP data, which is slated on November 30, many economists are now expecting growth rate to be near 7 per cent. The overall growth forecast for financial year 2023-24 is, however, being seen around 6.2-6.7 per cent as growth may moderate in the second half of the year given the input cost pressures and waning of base effect.

Toyota open to assembly line reformatting as Tesla’s ‘gigacasting’ threatens to upend car making,"Tesla’s die cast — or the gigacast, as Musk terms it — visualises the entire underbody of an EV as a single piece, instead of multiple parts bolted and welded together using workers and robots, as is done at most car assembly lines.","At the heart of Toyota Kirloskar Motor’s sprawling 432-acre Bidadi factory on the outskirts of Bengaluru, the Japanese carmaker’s trademark “milkrun” inbound logistics model is in full flow. The model essentially replicates a traditional version of household milk bottle deliveries – wherein the company organises its key suppliers into clusters based on geographic location, parts are picked up from them by trucks on a “milk route” and then finally delivered via cross-docks to the Toyota plants on a ‘just-in-time’ basis to ensure near perfection in synchronising shipment inflows to production schedules.
The model, with its ‘small lots, frequent deliveries’ concept, finally culminates on the assembly line, where each of these small parts are progressively integrated into the larger body frame or key components of the car, and has endured for the better part of the last half-a-century as an intrinsic part of the world’s largest carmaker’s much-vaunted Toyota Production System (TPS). But this part-by-part assembly aggregation model now has an external challenge that threatens to fundamentally upend the way the factory floor processes that Toyota has perfected and other automakers have progressively emulated.

SEBI board approves flexibility in framework for social stock exchange,Board defers changes to delisting regulations,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) board on Saturday approved certain flexibility in the framework for social stock exchange (SSE), aimed at providing impetus to fund raising by not for profit organizations (NPOs).
The board, which discussed the delisting regulations in its meeting, did not announce the final norms on it, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said.
She said the board observed that the number of delisting applications received over the last five years is small, and therefore the data set is very limited to draw a very significant conclusion.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The board guided us to go back and do further examination of certain data and do consultation with stakeholders. That is the reason that it (changes delisting regulations) was not done this time,” Buch said.
Earlier this year, the regulator had said that it may allow companies to delist shares at a fixed price as against the current reverse book-building process.
On SSE framework, SEBI board has reduced the minimum issue size in case of public issuance of zero coupon zero principal instruments (ZCZP) by NPOs on SSE to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 1 crore.
In order to enable wider participation of subscribers including retail, the minimum application size in case of public issuance of ZCZP by NPOs on SSE has been reduced from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10,000.

With the objective of fostering transparency and accountability in governance and administration of financial benchmarks in the securities market, the board approved a regulatory framework for Index Providers. The regulations will provide a framework for registration of Index Providers which license ‘Significant Indices’ that will be notified by SEBI based on objective criteria.
The Board approved amendments to SEBI (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 in order to create a regulatory framework for facilitation of Small & Medium REITs (SM REITs), with an asset value of at least Rs 50 crore vis-à-vis minimum asset value of Rs 500 crore for existing REITs.
It also brought in amendment to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, to facilitate ease of compliance and strengthen protection of interest of investors in AIFs.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Any fresh investment made by an AIF, beyond September 2024, shall be held in dematerialised form,” the board said.
However, the existing investments made by AIFs have been exempted from the requirement in cases where Investee company has been mandated under applicable law to facilitate dematerialisation of its securities and investments where the AIF, on its own, or along with other SEBI registered intermediaries, has control in the investee company.
Speaking on T+0 settlement of trades in the securities market, SEBI chairperson said the progress has been very good. Currently, the settlement happens on a trading-plus-one day (T+1) basis, which will be shifted to T+0 or same day settlement. The regulator has also announced plans to move to trading-plus-one hour (T+1 hour) settlement and then to instantaneous settlement.
“The feedback (from market infrastructure and brokers) is that it will be quicker and less expensive to move to T+0 and then move to instantaneous settlement rather than to move to one-hour (settlement) and then to instantaneous settlement. Since that roadmap is working out very well, we feel that the incremental benefit of inserting a one-hour (trade settlement) in the middle may not be there,” Buch said.
“The timeline for T+0 is before this financial year and then another one year from there for instantaneous settlement of trades,” she said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sebi-board-approves-flexibility-in-framework-for-social-stock-exchange-9042600/,business
India-China trade data discrepancy rises to $15 billion in January-October this year,"896 cases of under-valuation detected last year, recovery process was underway, says government","The magnitude of the discrepancy in the India-China official trade numbers as per data sets released separately by New Delhi and Beijing has widened further this year, amid rising instances of under-invoicing and potentially higher losses to the Indian exchequer despite efforts by tax authorities to plug loopholes.
The disparity between official figures on exports to India released by China and the imports from China reported by India jumped over 20 percent to $15.47 billion during the first 10 months of 2023, as against $12.75 billion in the corresponding period last year. Under-invoicing of imported goods involves marking the stated value of imports below the actual value paid to the foreign exporter, thereby reducing the import tax outgo.

‘A lot quieter’ Black Friday brings out discount hunters,"The Black Friday tradition began in the US but has gone global, as well as moving online. The rise of online shopping has reduced the importance of Black Friday as a single-day event.","Shoppers took to stores across the world on a Black Friday that appeared subdued compared with prior years, looking for discounted electronics, clothing and household goods in the kickoff to the holiday shopping season crucial to big retailers.
Brokerage TD Cowen lowered its US holiday spending estimate to 2% to 3% growth, from 4% to 5%, as it forecast flat Black Friday traffic. Discounts in October and November removed the excitement and urgency of Black Friday.
“People have already got what they want,” said David Klink, senior analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which owns shares of Walmart and Target. “There are only so many big-screen TVs and Alexa [Amazon voice assistants] you can buy.”
ADVERTISEMENT
With many consumers squeezed by persistent inflation and high interest rates, US holiday spending is expected to rise at the slowest pace in five years. Most major retailers slashed their seasonal hiring. Retailers will likely continue to discount throughout the season to avoid inventory gluts at yearend.
Caution from shoppers — coupled with a strong quarterly performance from discount retailers like Target and Ross Stores — show lingering concern over inflation and a higher cost of living even as fears of a recession recede. “People are more value conscious,” said Barbara Kahn, a professor at The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. “People are spending, but they’re spending more conservatively.”
A record 130.7 million people are expected to shop in stores and online in the US on Black Friday this year, the National Retail Federation estimates. But at 6 a.m. on Friday at a Walmart in New Milford, Connecticut, the parking lot was only half full. “It’s a lot quieter this year, a lot quieter,” said shopper Theresa Forsberg, who visits the same five stores with her family at dawn every Black Friday. She was at a nearby Kohl’s store at 5 a.m.
In Paramus, New Jersey, crowds at the Garden State Plaza mall were thinner than prior years, according to Michael Brown, a partner at consulting firm Kearney, who has checked shopping activity for the past 35 years. “It wasn’t the good, old-fashioned kick-the-doors-down-type” shopping event this year, he said. Mall goers “were carrying a bag or two, not the armfuls that you would see in pre-pandemic years. They are not blowing the budget today.”
ADVERTISEMENT
US shoppers plan to spend an average $875 on holiday purchases – $42 more than last year – with clothing, gift cards and toys at the top of most shopping lists, according to a survey of 8,424 adults conducted in early November by the National Retail Federation.
The Black Friday tradition began in the USUS but has gone global, as well as moving online. The rise of online shopping has reduced the importance of Black Friday as a single-day event.
Shoppers spent an estimated $7.3 billion online through 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Black Friday, a 7.4% increase compared with last year, data from Adobe Analytics showed. On Thanksgiving day, they shelled out $5.6  billion online, Adobe said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I think people are going to still spend on travel and leisure activities that might be online and not necessarily in stores,” said Jimmy Lee, CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group, which holds Amazon shares. “The excitement of waiting in lines on Black Friday – there’s not as much of that anymore. A lot of people …. would rather just sit at home and look for deals.”
Deeper Discounts
Retailers from Macy’s to Amazon launched deals as early as October and are likely to offer additional discounts closer to Christmas, Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette told investors this month. Whether those deals will attract inflation-weary consumers is the biggest worry for retailers.
Best Buy is offering between $100 and $1,600 off electronics including laptops, flat-screen TVs and KitchenAid mixers after telling investors this week that shoppers are holding off on big-ticket purchases. A downturn in luxury spending prompted department stores, including Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom, to offer steep discounts on items such as Balenciaga shoes and Oscar de la Renta earrings.
On Chicago’s Magnificent Mile, shoppers were unimpressed. Carlos Araejo-Ruiz, 17, hoped for a deal on designer belts at Nordstrom. “There was an enthusiastic factor when you’re looking forward to jaw-dropping deals. It’s not the equivalent to years before,” he said.
Paul Aheren, 69, who drove from Indianapolis, said he remembered when luxury department stores had markdowns up to 70%. “At Saks,’ if you came in from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., they had a bunch of stuff reduced. You don’t see any of that anymore,” he said. “What they are doing now is clearing the stock they couldn’t sell. I don’t consider that a bargain.”

Sporadic protests
Black Friday came at the start of a four-day Israel-Hamas truce. Protesters held sporadic “shut it down for Palestine” demonstrations across the United States.

"Adani-Hindenburg row: No reason to discredit SEBI, says SC, reserves order","While asking the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) what it intends to do in future to ensure investors don't loose wealth due to volatility in stock market or short-selling, the apex court observed it would not be proper for it to set up a special investigation team (SIT) on its own without any material before it.","The Supreme Court on Friday said it has no reason to “discredit” SEBI, which probed allegations against the Adani group, as there was no material before it to doubt what the market regulator has done and the court does not have to treat what was set out in the Hindenburg report as a “true state of affairs”.
While asking the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) what it intends to do in future to ensure investors don’t loose wealth due to volatility in stock market or short-selling, the apex court observed it would not be proper for it to set up a special investigation team (SIT) on its own without any material before it.
A bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, which reserved its order on a batch of pleas concerning the Adani-Hindenburg row on allegations of stock price manipulation, said it cannot ask a statutory regulator to take as a “gospel truth” something which was published in the media.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We don’t have to treat what is set out in the Hindenburg report as ipso facto (automatically) a true state of affairs. That is why we directed the SEBI to investigate. Because for us to accept something which is in the report of an entity, which in not before us and whose veracity we have no means of testing, would really be unfair,” the bench, also comprising justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for one of the petitioners.
Bhushan argued that SEBI’s role in the matter was “suspect” for several reasons because a lot of information was available to the regulator way back in 2014.
“They have completed their investigations. They are saying that is now in their quasi-judicial power. Should they disclose the investigation before they issue a notice to show cause,” the bench asked.
Bhushan said it was for the apex court to see whether the probe done by the SEBI was credible or not and whether some other independent organisation or an SIT was needed to be formed to investigate it.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Where is the material before us for us to doubt what SEBI has done,” the bench observed.
It also took serious note of Bhushan’s claim that two of the members of the apex court appointed expert committee have serious “conflict of interest”.
The bench said there has to be some responsibility about the allegations being made as it was easy to level allegations.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You have to also be very careful. It is very easy to make allegations. We are not here giving a character certificate. But equally we have to be conscious about fundamental principles of fairness,” the bench observed.
Dealing with the submissions relating to SEBI probe, it said, “We have to be also conscious that SEBI is a statutory body exclusively entrusted with the jurisdiction to investigate into stock market violations. Today, is it proper for a court, the highest court, to just without any material to say that we will not let you investigate and we will constitute a SIT of our own? This has to be done with a great deal of calibration.” Bhushan referred to the Hindenburg report as also some media report to buttress his arguments that SEBI’s probe was not credible.
“I don’t think you can ask a statutory regulator to take as a gospel truth something which is filed in a newspaper, whether in the Guardian or the Financial Times. We have no reason to discredit them…,” the bench said.
“Therefore, should SEBI be following up journalists and ask a journalist, who is not subject to their jurisdiction, to disclose the underlying materials,” it said.
Bhushan argued that if a journalist can get hold of documents, how can the SEBI, with all its vast powers of investigation, not being able to get hold of these materials.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bench said there was always a correct way of looking at it for a simple reason that when “you are dealing with a body which is governed by evidentiary requirements… somebody who publishes something in the public realm, is not bound by the evidentiary standards with which a statutory body is bound”.
“They are amenable to jurisdiction of the security appellate tribunal. You can’t pick out and say well, I will rely on newspaper report and issue a notice of show cause. That notice will be quashed by a judicial body,” it said.
Bhushan said the show cause notice would not be quashed if it was based on credible information which leads to suspicion.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As a court, how do we treat it as credible? We will have to rely on our investigative agencies to investigate it,” the bench said, adding, “We can’t make that assumption that it is either credible or lacking in credibility”.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the SEBI, told the bench that there was “a growing tendency of planting stories outside India to influence things and policies inside India”.
At the outset, Mehta apprised the bench that investigation in 22 out of the 24 cases relating to allegations against the Adani group were over.

A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had in an interim report in May stated that it saw “no evident pattern of manipulation” in billionaire Gautam Adani’s companies and there was no regulatory failure.
The Adani Group stocks had been bludgeoned on the bourses after Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those about fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate.

RBI tightening: Bankers blame ‘high’ NBFC exposure to small unsecured loans,RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said Wednesday that the increasing interconnectedness between banks and non-banks merits close attention.,"The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to increase risk weights on the unsecured consumer credit and credit card dues is driven primarily by concerns over a sharp rise in such loans offered by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and onward lending by them through fintechs, bankers said.
The RBI’s worry is mostly in the sub-Rs 50,000 loan segment of unsecured personal loans, where NBFCs have high exposure. NBFCs have been catering to this low-ticket segment of borrowers through their tie-ups with fintech companies. Any stress at NBFCs will have an impact on the banking sector, lenders said.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said Wednesday that the increasing interconnectedness between banks and non-banks merits close attention.

“Largely, it is the NBFCs (unsecured personal loan) book which has grown very abnormally. NBFCs exposure to unsecured personal loans have grown up very fast and that is why the entire industry figure has also gone up. This has worried the regulator,” said a banker who didn’t wish to be named.
The RBI did not respond to an email seeking comment.
On Thursday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asked NBFCs and small finance banks to remain cautious while lending as suggested by the RBI.
“Enthusiasm is good but sometimes it becomes a bit too far for people to digest. So as a measure of caution the RBI has also alerted small finance banks, NBFCs to be careful that they don’t go too far too soon and face any downside risks later,” she said at an event.
ADVERTISEMENT
Banks, meanwhile, maintain that there are no concerns over their own unsecured loan portfolios as they offer loans to their customers with salary accounts and can better track cash flow records.
The Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), set up by the RBI, had recently raised concerns over the rise in the bank financing for NBFCs.
Following the market correction prompted by the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) default and a brief pause due to the pandemic, bank financing for NBFCs has begun to rise again, it said. “This raises concerns about systemic contagion and underscores the need for tighter preventive measures to mitigate potential systemic fallout,” CAFRAL, a not-for-profit organisation, said in its India Finance Report earlier this month.

Unsecured personal loans do not require collateral. These loans are riskier — if borrowers default, lenders won’t have collateral to recover the debt.
On November 16, the RBI increased the risk weights on the exposure of banks towards consumer credit, credit card receivables and NBFCs. A higher risk weight means lenders need to set aside more funds as a safety net for consumer loans, which could make such credit more expensive. It restricts banks’ lending capacity as they have to set aside more funds for solvency.
The risk weight on NBFC exposure to unsecured retail loans went up to 125 per cent from 100 per cent earlier. Additionally, the RBI increased the risk weights on bank loans to NBFCs by 25 percentage points to 125 per cent in all cases where the extant risk weight rating of an NBFC is below 100 per cent.
The central bank increased the risk weights on credit card receivables by 25 percentage points to 150 per cent. Credit card outstanding of banks had shot up by 29.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2.17 lakh crore as of September 2023.
NBFCs’ personal loans rose by 31.3 per cent in March 2023, the RBI’s Financial Stability Report released in June this year said. NBFCs’ personal loan growth stood at around 14 per cent as at September 2022 and around three per cent as at March 2022. The personal loan portfolio of NBFCs grew the most during the last four-year period (a compound annual growth rate of more than 30 per cent) resulting in an increase of its share in the total loan portfolio to 31.2 per cent in March 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a Fitch Ratings report, growth in banks’ unsecured credit card loans and personal loans in the first half of the financial year ending March 2024 stood at 29.9 per cent and 25.5 per cent y-o-y, respectively, against a total system loan growth of 20 per cent. NBFC growth has shown a similar trend. Higher unsecured personal loan exposure of NBFCs means these lenders are more prone to risk in case of a default.
Bankers said any stress in the NBFC sector could have a contagion effect on the banking sector, as was seen in the case of failure of IL&FS.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The RBI is uncomfortable with higher borrowing of NBFCs from banks. Any trouble that NBFCs will have on their asset quality through consumer credit, will also mean that they will go into trouble and so, banks can have an impact as they have lent to NBFCs,” said a private sector lender.

Of the total borrowings of 62.3 per cent as at March 2023, NBFCs borrowed 25.2 per cent from banks. This also includes NBFCs commercial papers and debentures subscribed by banks. NBFCs borrowing from banks stood around 23.6 as at March 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking at a banking event on Wednesday, RBI governor said that NBFCs are large net borrowers of funds from the financial system, with their exposure from the banks being the highest. Banks are also one of the key subscribers to the debentures and commercial papers issued by NBFCs. NBFCs also maintain borrowing relationships with multiple banks simultaneously.
“Needless to state that such concentrated linkages may create a contagion risk. Though the banks are well capitalised, they must constantly evaluate their exposure to NBFCs and the exposure of individual NBFCs to multiple banks,” Das said.
Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC), a representative body of NBFCs, on Thursday requested the RBI to re-evaluate the sharp increase in risk weights assigned to bank loans to NBFCs.
“While we understand the purpose of the Bank (RBI) to regulate credit flow to the consumer sector, this measure inadvertently, also has the potential to sharply reduce flow of credit to MSMEs, self-employed and other sectors which rely upon credit from NBFCs,” FIDC said in a letter to the RBI.

The cost of funds to these critical sectors is also likely to increase sharply, especially at a time when the interest rates are already high after the RBI hiked the Repo rates.
MSME and self-employed segments are emerging from the Covid impact and are looking ahead to increase capital expenditure through modernization and expansion of productive capacity, FIDC said.
Fitch Rating in the report said it estimates that the effect of higher risk weights on banks’ loans to NBFCs may be significant, averaging about 34 basis points (bps), while that of higher credit-card risk weights should be lower, at around 5 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-tightening-bankers-blame-high-nbfc-exposure-to-small-unsecured-loans-9040011/,business
PSU general insurers lose market share further,"The industry’s growth will be primarily driven by the health and motor insurance segments, supported by increasing disposable income levels and a rise across other segments.","Public sector general insurers have lost market share again with aggressive private companies taking the competition to new levels. PSU insurers saw their combined market share declining to 31.99 per cent as of September 2023 with a growth rate of 12.16 per cent, down from 32.76 per cent market share in September 2022 with a growth rate of 6.43 per cent.
On the other hand, private general insurers managed to increase their combined market share to 53.58 per cent by September 2023 with a growth rate of 21.13 per cent as compared to market share of 50.81 per cent in September 2022 with a growth rate of 21.33 per cent, according to data from India’s insurance regulator.
State-owned New India is the largest insurer with a market share of 13.09 per cent followed by ICICI Lombard (market share 8.67 per cent) and Bajaj Allianz (market share 7.69 per cent). These top 3 insurers have combined market share of 29.46 per cent with a growth rate of 18.45 per cent. Eight insurers have more than 5 per cent market share of total non-life domestic premium as of September 2023. “Non-life industry had underwritten a gross premium of Rs 143,802 crore with a growth rate of 14.86 per cent as compared to Rs 125,194 crore with a growth rate of 15.30 per cent by September 2022,” the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said.

The industry’s growth will be primarily driven by the health and motor insurance segments, supported by increasing disposable income levels and a rise across other segments. Meanwhile, the non-life insurance industry reported a premium of Rs 23,814 crore in the month of October 2023, rising by a more sedate 13.6 per cent compared to last month’s 29.1 per cent (the growth had come off a lower base) and 18.5 per cent in October 2022.
Health segment is the largest non-life segment with a share of 37.57 per cent, followed by motor (28.40 per cent) and crop insurance (11.41 per cent). Marine cargo, marine hull, crop insurance and liability (total) registered a negative growth rate as of September 2023.
According to IRDAI, the non-life industry has underwritten a gross premium of Rs 54,030 crore under the health segment with a growth rate of 24.43 per cent as compared to Rs 43,421 crore with a growth rate of 17.92 per cent as of September 2022. Under the health segment, the market share of PSU general insurers declined to 40.41 per cent as of September 2023 with a growth rate of 9.92 per cent, down from the market share of 45.75 per cent in September 2022 with a growth rate of 11.30 per cent.
Industry observers said health insurance premiums continue to be the primary growth agent of the non-life insurance industry. “The group health segment remains the largest segment due to enhanced coverage, and rationalisation of discounts in premiums. However, the segment witnessed a decline for the month of October 2023 — mostly due to lower premiums collected by the public sector companies,” Care Ratings said in a report.

Government schemes grew sharply in FY24 and increased their share to 11 per cent in FY24 from 9.8 per cent in FY23 due to Ayushman Bharat and other medical schemes. Further premiums of the government schemes are generally concentrated with the public sector general insurance companies. Overseas medical segment has returned to pre-pandemic levels as international travel has increased.
Under the health segment, private general insurers managed to increase their market share to 33.40 per cent by September 2023 with a growth rate of 45.97 per cent as compared to market share of 28.47 per cent in September 2022 with a growth rate of 22.35 per cent. Standalone health insurers have combined market share of 26.19 per cent in September 2023 with a growth rate of 26.41 per cent as compared to market share of 25.78 per cent in September 2022 with a growth rate of 26.18 per cent, according to IRDAI data.

Customer data with account aggregators completely safe in India: Sitharaman,"Account aggregators (AA) are entities that enable financial data sharing from Financial Information Providers (FIPs) to Financial Information Users (FIUs), based on the consent from the customers.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday assured that customer data shared with account aggregators (AA) is completely safe in India.
Concerned over the slow movement of the AA scheme, she said, “It is not as much as I would want to see. It can be better, which means either the building of awareness exercises are not sufficient, adequate” or there is a need for simplification of technology.
“Banks, both public and private, have reviewed it with me once. Banks have become a member or a part of this account aggregators working, and it has actually helped,” she said at the ‘DATE with Tech’ event here. She stressed that the enthusiasm of the banks has to be accentuated, only then that it will reach every customer.
Allaying concerns about data security, she said, “Initially, there were some apprehensions that possibly, account aggregators are going to sit over data bank. They cannot hold data. They are just a pass-through. Neither the beneficiary customer nor the bank can sit on it through the AA. They will deal with it only for the purpose of giving credit”.

Asked about what kind of assurance she can provide to customers, Sitharaman said the government’s approach in creating public platforms for banking facilities ensures customer data protection. “The moment you agree to be willing to give it, it will be shared without much hindrance. On data protection, I can assure Indian citizens your data remains completely safe,” she said.
Account aggregators (AA) are entities that enable financial data sharing from Financial Information Providers (FIPs) to Financial Information Users (FIUs), based on the consent from the customers.
On low insurance penetration in India, Sitharaman said there have been experiments by Scheduled Commercial Banks to increase the penetration. Insurance companies will have to be a lot smarter by adopting technology tools and addressing last-mile distribution of their products, she added. “There is a need for insurance companies to become a lot more tech-ready and through technology, but because insurance is such a sentimental matter. You still need a human interface. Insurance companies will have to adapt technology, bring in more personnel, who can go to the field and only then can we achieve greater and wider insurance coverage,” she said.
Insurance penetration in India during 2021-22 at 4.2 per cent remained the same as in 2020-21.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/customer-data-with-account-aggregators-completely-safe-in-india-sitharaman-9039665/,business

Will increase interest rates if cost of funds rises: SBI Chairman,"As per a recent SBI research report, the banking industry will require Rs 84,000 crore of excess capital or five per cent increase on Rs 15.2 lakh crore capital requirement following the RBI decision to tighten the risk weights on unsecured loans.","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Khara on Wednesday said the RBI’s move to raise risk weights on consumer credit, credit card dues and lending to NBFCs may result in an increase in the interest rates by the bank.

Benefits of joining IPEF’s trade pillar unclear: Official,"The trade pillar is one of the most crucial parts of IPEF that seeks commitment on sensitive areas as agriculture, digital trade and labour and could require changes in domestic regulation.","With the scheduled seven rounds of Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) negotiations drawing to a close this month, New Delhi continues to be skeptical of joining the trade pillar citing the lack of “tangible benefits”, said a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter.
The trade pillar is one of the most crucial parts of IPEF that seeks commitment on sensitive areas as agriculture, digital trade and labour and could require changes in domestic regulation. However, in a setback to the Washington-driven IPEF that seeks to counter China’s dominance in the region, an agreement on the trade pillar was not reached in the last round in San Francisco.
IPEF was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year in Tokyo and is structured around four key negotiating subjects or pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). But unlike traditional trade deals, IPEF does not deal with market access.

"Binance’s Changpeng Zhao pleads guilty, steps down to settle US illicit finance probe","Binance broke US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with organizations the US described as terrorist groups including Hamas, al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, authorities said.","Binance chief Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering laws as part of a $4.3 billion settlement resolving a years-long probe into the world’s largest crypto exchange, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The deal, which will see Zhao personally pay $50 million, was described by prosecutors as one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. It is another blow to the crypto industry that has been beset by investigations and comes on the heels of the recent fraud conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
But several legal experts said it was a good outcome for Zhao, leaving his vast wealth intact and allowing him to retain his stake in Binance, the exchange he founded in 2017.

Binance broke US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with organizations the US described as terrorist groups including Hamas, al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, authorities said.
The exchange also never reported transactions with websites devoted to selling child sexual abuse materials and was one of the largest recipients of ransomware proceeds, they said.
“Binance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Tuesday. “Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law. It pretended to comply.”
Some of the charges, which are both criminal and civil, relate to practices that Reuters reported first in a series of articles in 2022.
The Justice Department, which negotiated the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Treasury Department, is seeking an 18-month prison sentence for Zhao, the maximum suggested under federal guidelines, the New York Times reported.

Binance’s former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim was charged by the CFTC, the agency said. Neither Lim nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.
Binance will pay $1.81 billion within 15 months, and a further $2.51 billion forfeiture as part of the deal, prosecutors said.
Zhao, a billionaire, was born in China and moved to Canada at the age of 12. He pleaded guilty in a Seattle court on Tuesday afternoon.

“Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance,” Zhao said on social media after the settlement was announced. “Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.”
While authorities have probed Zhao and Binance for years, Zhao’s exit marks a dramatic development for one of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry, and for Binance. The deal raises questions over the future of the crypto exchange, which he has tightly controlled.
Richard Teng, a longtime Binance executive, will take over at Binance, Zhao said in his post.
“These resolutions acknowledge our company’s responsibility for historical, criminal compliance violations, and allow our company to turn the page,” Binance said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Teng said that his focus would be on “reassuring users that they can remain confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company.”

Zhao retains Binance stake
Vanderbilt University law professor Yesha Yadav said while the fine was extremely large it appeared manageable for Binance.
“This deal…looks designed to give Binance the chance to live another day, while removing CZ, a figurehead who has been so intrinsically linked to the growth of a business model,” she said.

Since Zhao appears to be retaining his stake in Binance, however, it’s possible he may still be able to exert influence on the company, Yadav added.
Zhao is worth $10.2 billion, according to Forbes.
Given the seriousness of the violations and actors involved, Zhao appears to have “come out of this looking pretty good” as the US government likely had to entice him to come to the US, said Robert Frenchman of Mukasey Frenchman LLP.

“He still has enormous wealth,” Frenchman said. “He isn’t likely to spend too much time in a US jail. He retains his ownership stake in Binance, a company that has now resolved some of its biggest legal issues.”
Prosecutors likely weighed those benefits for Zhao against the possibility that he may not have otherwise surrendered and the desire to convince Binance to agree to pay a hefty sum, said Jeffrey Cohen, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.
“If you can get a good number for a corporate fine and the cost is that the individual defendants take a slightly lesser penalty, the government makes that calculation,” Cohen said.
‘Potentially illegal’
Binance has been under the Justice Department’s scrutiny since at least 2018, Reuters reported last year, just one of a string of legal headaches it faces in the United States.
Federal prosecutors asked the company in December 2020 to provide internal records about its anti-money laundering efforts, along with communications involving Zhao.
The CFTC filed its civil charges against Binance in March, alleging it failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program to detect and prevent terrorist financing. Internally, Binance officers and employees acknowledged that the platform facilitated “potentially illegal activities,” the CFTC alleged.
In February 2019, Binance’s Lim received information on transactions by the militant Palestinian group Hamas on Binance, the CFTC wrote.
Lim, a Singaporean, “explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send ‘small sums’ as ‘large sums constitute money laundering’,” the CFTC said in its March lawsuit.
Daniel Silva, a partner at law firm Buchalter and former federal prosecutor said the allegations likely could have supported charges against Zhao carrying stiffer penalties like fraud or money laundering.
“He was at risk of much more serious charges, and so this resolution is a very favorable one for him,” Silva said.
Even so, a guilty plea involving the CEO of a company is rare and underscores the Justice Department’s push under Democratic leadership for charges against executives.
“The government is beating a drum on the issue of individual accountability,” said Kit Addleman, a partner with Haynes Boone law firm in Dallas.
She noted the size of the fines make clear the US government wants to rein in the crypto sector, describing the financial size of the deal as “staggering”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/binance-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty-steps-down-us-illicit-finance-probe-9037957/,business

"Rupee volatility low, exhibited orderly movements relative to peers: RBI Governor","Speaking at the annual FIBAC event, Das said household inflation expectations are becoming more anchored, but added that headline inflation is vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks.","Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said the rupee has witnessed “low volatility” and orderly movements as compared to its peers.
Speaking at the annual FIBAC event, Das said household inflation expectations are becoming more anchored, but added that headline inflation is vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks.
It can be noted that the rupee closed at an all-time low of 83.35 against the dollar on Monday, but gained some lost ground in Tuesday’s trade.

“On the exchange rate front, the Indian rupee (INR) has exhibited low volatility and orderly movements relative to peers despite elevated US treasury yields and a strong US dollar,” Das said.
He said this is courtesy the strength of the underlying macro-fundamentals of our economy and the reassuring forex buffers.
In the last three or four days, the US DXY (dollar index) has slightly softened and treasury yields in the US have also softened.
Crediting RBI’s rate hikes, liquidity tightening moves and supply-side measures undertaken by the government for the headline consumer price inflation cooling off to 4.9 per cent in October, Das stressed that the RBI is “completely focused” on getting the headline inflation down to 4 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
The monetary policy will be “watchful” about the emerging trends and “actively disinflationary”, Das said, adding that it will be supporting growth as well.
He said the softening in the core inflation gives the RBI the conviction that “monetary policy seems to be working”.
The headline inflation can come under pressure because of “overlapping and continuing shocks from food inflation”, Das said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He also reiterated the Arjuna analogy to speak about the resolute focus of the central bank on inflation, and also borrowed from the ‘Swayamvar’ scene in the mythological text to say that just like Arjuna focusing on the bird’s eye while calculating the ripples and sound in the room, the central bank also takes into account various other aspects.
Meanwhile, he said household inflation expectations are becoming more anchored and cited recent surveys by the Reserve Bank which illustrate this.
Das, who has been at the helm since 2019, said he has focused on communication to set the expectations of households and ensured that the central bank reaches the last person.
He said the world is grappling with an unending stream of challenges like volatile commodities, uncertainty around monetary policies, geopolitical events and climate shocks since 2020, making it a “complicated and deadly mix of challenges”.
He also pitched for reforms in agri marketing and connected value chains for sustained high grwh, durable price stability and mitigating price shocks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rupee-volatility-low-orderly-movements-relative-peers-rbi-governor-9037976/,business

Additional Secretary at the commerce ministry, Rajesh Agarwal clarified that the agreement mentioned imposing “unnecessary” export restrictions, but it is caveated and is similar to the World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions and not beyond that. If a country imposes any export curb without giving any justification, that is treated as unnecessary, he clarified.

A fresh Request For Proposal (RFP) would be invited soon after a review of some of the bid criteria to enable better interest from bidders.
“It has been decided with the approval of the competent authority to cancel the present RFP and to issue a fresh RFP for selection of an asset valuer for strategic disinvestment of IDBI Bank Ltd,” DIPAM said in a corrigendum.

“We had only a single bid. A fresh RFP will be issued soon after we review some of the criteria to enable better interest from bidders,” a government official said.
The government, along with LIC, is selling nearly 61 per cent stake in IDBI Bank and in January received multiple Expressions of Interest (EoIs) for the same.
Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had last week said the IDBI Bank strategic sale transaction is “on course” but the transaction would not be completed in the current fiscal.
“We practically don’t think that before March we can conclude it (IDBI Bank stake sale),” Pandey had said.

As part of the strategic sale process, on September 1, DIPAM invited bids for appointing an asset valuer and the last date for submission of bids was October 9. The deadline was later extended till October 30.
The asset valuer was mandated to identify intangibles not on the IDBI Bank balance sheet, like brand name, branch network and value them.
The terms of reference for asset valuers included describing and listing of all the properties and assets, including intangibles such as trademark(s), title to property rights being valued, as provided by the bank.
Valuation of intangibles were required to be indicated separately.

The asset properties in the seven cities account for 94 per cent of the total written down value (after accounting for depreciation) of fixed assets of IDBI Bank.
The government and LIC together hold 94.72 per cent stake in IDBI Bank.

While the deadline can be extended via an application to the courts, creditors are currently not inclined to do so, two banking sources said.

The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Jindal Power and Go First’s resolution professional did not reply to emails seeking comment.
Go First filed for voluntary insolvency in May and owes a total of 65.21 billion rupees ($785.6 million) to its creditors.

SEBI chief urges investors to take long-term view of markets to beat inflation rate,"SEBI’s study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22.","SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Monday urged investors to invest on a long-term basis as it would help in wealth creation, beat inflation and provide real rate of returns.
Referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent study, which showed that around 89 per cent of the individual traders in the equity Futures and options (F&O) segment incurred losses with an average loss of Rs 1.1 lakh during FY 2021-2022 (FY22), Buch said she was confused and surprised as to why people continue to trade in the segment knowing that the odds are not in their favour at all.
“There is a 90 per cent chance that the investor will lose money in the F&O segment. But we also know and the data shows us that, if you take a long-term view of the market and if you invest with a long term perspective, you will rarely go wrong,” she said at the launch of an Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
F&O are derivative instruments where traders buy an underlying asset (share) at a predetermined price.
SEBI’s study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22.
For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), on an average, loss makers registered net trading loss close to Rs 50,000 in FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), the average loss of a loss maker was over 15 times the average profit by a profit maker during FY22, the study showed. Buch said the real power lies in the hands of the investors if they take a longer-term view on their investments.
If investors take a long-term view, there is really a good chance that they would be creating wealth for themselves and their family over a sustained period of time that would “exceed the inflation rate in the economy”, and therefore, they would actually get “real rate of return on their investments over the long-term”, she said.

At the end of September 2023, 3.35 crore demat accounts were registered with National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and 9.62 crore with Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), as per the SEBI’s October bulletin.
IRRA platform, which was launched by Buch, is conceptualised and implemented by market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) under the guidance of SEBI to reduce risks faced by investors in the eventuality of technical glitch at trading member end at both primary site and disaster recovery site.
It provides investors an opportunity to square off or cancel their pending orders in case of a disruption of trading services provided by trading members.
ADVERTISEMENT
Buch said the IRRA platform is a safety net that will help people to invest with confidence.
“The hope is that this is a system that we will never need to use. It’s like a safety net which is there for a trapeze artist…he hopes to never use that safety net but it really needs to be there,” she said.
IRRA can be invoked by trading members when they are faced with a technical glitch at their end impacting their ability to service clients across exchanges from both – primary site and disaster recovery site, where relevant.
On invocation, after basic checks, the platform downloads trades of trading members from all the trading venues and sends SMS/email to investors using internet trading or wireless technology along with a link to access IRRA. Investors using this link can review the status of their investment, orders etc, and place orders for squaring off or closing positions.
Speaking on the upstreaming of clients funds by stock brokers (SBs)/ clearing members (CMs) to clearing corporations (CCs), the chairperson said though it was implemented, the regulator has received feedback about difficulty in complying with the guidelines.
As per the framework, SBs/CMs cannot retain clients’ funds on an end of day (EoD) basis. The clients’ funds has to be upstreamed by SB/ CMs to CCs only in the form of either cash, lien on fixed deposit receipts (FDR), or pledge of units of Mutual Fund Overnight Schemes (MFOS).

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,"Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.","Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.
Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala’s capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.
The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.
ADVERTISEMENT
“In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,” he is quoted as having said in the release.
He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.
“The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.
“Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,” he said.
The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.
Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.
“Apart from improved infrastructure and the government’s pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.
“…but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,” he said.
He also noted Kerala’s startup journey has been an inspiring one.
The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.
KSUM is the Kerala government’s nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world’s top business incubators.
The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India’s biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.

"RBI tightening of unsecured loans: Banks may need Rs 84,000 crore excess capital","The Reserve Bank of India decided to increase the risk weight on the exposure of banks to consumer credit, credit card receivables and non-banking finance companies.","The banking industry will likely require Rs 84,000 crore of excess capital — or a five per cent increase — over the Rs 15.2 lakh crore capital requirement following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to increase the risk weight on the exposure of banks to consumer credit, credit card receivables and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Experts believe this will increase the cost of borrowing for consumers.
The immediate impact of the enhanced risk weights is the excess capital now that banks would require, according to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India. This means a 55-60 basis point increase in CRAR (capital to risk-weighted assets ratio).

SEBI had earlier said it may allow companies to delist shares at a fixed price as against the current reverse book-building process. Certain constituents in the market, in anticipation of the delisting, acquire shares and jack up the price of shares at unsustainable levels. Because of the way in which it (reverse book-building process) is formulated and because of the 90 per cent threshold, there is a possibility of misuse by certain operators who are specialists in the delisting of shares.

Sahara group has faced many allegations, including that of running a Ponzi scheme.

Roy was arrested in 2014 on the orders of the Supreme Court after he failed to appear before it in a contempt case arising out of non-refund of more than Rs 20,000 crore to investors by the two companies.

5 bad money habits and how to break them,"If you’re not careful with how you manage your money, these harmful money habits can destabilise you financially.","Managing money can be tricky. The ease with which one can now access financial products has its upsides and downsides. While on one hand, those who need funds can now access them easily, but on the other hand, it can also lead to indiscriminate spending which can land one in unnecessary debt. The excitement of festive season, too, can often exacerbate these habits. If you’re not careful with how you manage your money, these harmful money habits can destabilise you financially.
However, there are effective ways which can help you break the habit of being reckless with your money and instead, learn to utilise it smartly. Let’s look at some of these habits that many of us may be guilty of and how we can get past them to become financially stronger for the future.
Overspending
Budgeting is a powerful tool that helps instil a disciplined approach to spending. Without a budget, the risk of overspending runs high. To avoid that, begin by tracking your income and expenses to create a monthly budget. This will help you identify areas where you need to cut back and prioritize your spending based on your financial goals.
ADVERTISEMENT
For instance, you can allocate more money to for necessary expenses, debt repayments, and savings while limiting discretionary spending on non-essential items. A recently published workbook titled ‘The Prosperity Planner & Workbook’ may come in handy if you’re looking to assess your saving and budgeting skills. It can also serve as a guidebook to help you manage your overall finances.
Excessive debt
Indiscriminate credit consumption can lead to excessive debt. It is often accompanied by late payment penalties and high interest, both of which can trap you in a vicious cycle of debt, making you financially unstable and erode your wealth. The key to avoiding this is to understand how to use credit productively instead of destructively, and create a budget for your monthly spends. For instance, a home loan is a form of credit that helps you build an asset. But, overdue credit card bills are a form of destructive credit which lead to debt.
Not having an emergency fund
An emergency is a sudden, and often critical event that requires financial intervention. While you may dip into your savings to handle an emergency, doing so can deplete your savings and leave you unprepared for a future emergency. Instead, create an emergency fund which can help you during such unforeseen situations, without leaving you financially stressed. In the absence of an emergency fund, you may be forced to rely on credit cards, loans, or other high-interest credit avenues to cover unexpected costs, all of which can land you in deeper debt and cause greater financial damage in the long-run.
Not having insurance
Insurance serves as a safety net to protect you and your assets from unexpected financial losses. By avoiding insurance, you expose yourself and your loved ones to financial distress that may arise from unpredictable events like medical emergencies, accidents, or even death. Make sure to assess your family’s medical history and needs and get an adequate health cover that is at least 50% of more your annual income. This will help protect your finances in case of a health emergency that requires expensive hospitalisation. To protect your family’s financial future in your absence, get an adequate life insurance policy as well.
Not planning for retirement
ADVERTISEMENT
Retirement is an inevitable stage of life that can be a joyful time with some financial planning. Planning for retirement is a long-term goal and the earlier you start at it, the better. Plan your finances in a way that they allow you to accommodate your retirement planning goal such as saving. If you have investments, review them regularly to align them with your goals. And most importantly, don’t ignore the power of compounding – the longer you stay invested, the better your chances at creating a significant retirement corpus.

Using your credit card irresponsibly
Not paying your bills on time, making only minimum payments against your outstanding bill, or utilising your entire credit limit are some examples of irresponsible credit usage. These habits can not only damage your credit score, land you in debt, but also limit your access to credit in the future. A credit card is a useful tool that can not only help you make payments with ease, but when used smartly, it ca also help you save on routine expenses. But, the key to using these benefits is to pay your credit card bills in full, on time and staying within 30% of your total available credit limit.

It is never too late to take corrective steps, especially when it comes to managing your finances.

FY24 fiscal deficit seen at 5.9% even if nominal GDP misses Budget assumption: Official,Concerns have risen about nominal GDP growth not meeting the Budget assumption of 10.5 per cent as wholesale inflation has been negative for seven consecutive months.,"The Centre is confident of meeting its fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for financial year 2023-24 even if there is any variation in nominal GDP growth as the tax revenue trend is comfortable so far, a senior government official said Wednesday. The government is not looking at any curbs on spending, with some reallocation of savings expected to happen as it looks towards additional allocation for existing or new schemes in the supplementary demands for grants in the upcoming Parliament session, the official added.
Concerns have risen about nominal GDP growth not meeting the Budget assumption of 10.5 per cent as wholesale inflation has been negative for seven consecutive months. Some estimates have pegged the nominal GDP growth to be around 9 per cent which could result in a lower GDP deflator as it is primarily made of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The fiscal slippage risks arise from the fact that the government’s fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent is calculated as a percentage of the GDP. The latest print for WPI inflation rate unexpectedly fell to (-) 0.52 per cent in October, data released on November 14 showed.

Need for World Bank’s governance indicators to be transparent: CEA,The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators provide a ranking of 215 countries territories based on six dimensions of governance: ‘Voice and Accountability’; ‘Political Stability and Absence of Violence’; ‘Government Effectiveness’; ‘Regulatory Quality’; ‘Rule of Law’ and ‘Control of Corruption.’,"Raising concerns over the use of World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators in ratings assessment by credit ratings agencies, especially for emerging economies, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Wednesday said there is a need for the World Governance Index to be more transparent and less subjective.
“The World Bank….has something called the World Governance Index, which unfortunately or fortunately plays a very significant part in opaque and non-transparent ways in the credit rating assessment deployed by the three credit rating agencies in assigning letter-grades to credit rating of member countries, particularly emerging markets. This World Governance Index itself is a composite of several sub-indices, which are purely based on the subjective opinions of some so-called expert institutions which do not have presence on the ground nor do they understand whether the context in which they are making these judgements is appropriate or apt for the member countries. But these indices become an important part of the assessment methodology of the credit rating agencies and they do not reveal the extent to which these indices are implanted in their assessment process, the weights they carry, because there seems to be qualitative overlays on top of qualitative assessments,” Nageswaran said at a seminar on ‘Multilateral Institutions for the 21st Century’ organised by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.

The 14 countries that are part of IPEF include India, Australia, the US, Japan, Fiji, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand, and make up for 40% of global gross domestic product and about a third of global goods and services trade.
“India joins US and 12 other Indo-Pacific Economic Framework For Prosperity (IPEF) partners to ink the #IPEF Supply Chain Resilience Agreement, a first-of-its-kind international agreement that will fortify and strengthen global supply chains, foster adaptability, stability and sustainability,” Goyal said in a social media post.

Members of the bloc had concluded the negotiations on this agreement, one of the four pillars of the IPEF earlier this year in May.
The IPEF is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except the trade pillar.
The members are expected to announce the conclusion of talks for clean economy and fair economy pillars also this week.
“The Agreement is expected to make IPEF supply chains more resilient, robust, and well-integrated, and contribute towards economic development and progress of the region as a whole,” commerce and industry ministry said in a release.

The pact would come into force after the implementation of the agreement by any of the five member countries.
Under the fair economy pillar, IPEF partners are working on an agreement that will strengthen the implementation of effective anti-corruption and tax measures to boost commerce, trade and investment among IPEF economies.
As far as clean economy pillar is concerned, the member countries aim to cooperate on research, development, commercialisation, availability, accessibility, and deployment of clean energy and climate-friendly technologies.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-us-12-other-ipef-members-sign-supply-chain-resilience-agreement-9028332/,business

This action is necessitated due to non-adherence of the company to the extant provisions of digital lending guidelines of Reserve Bank of India, particularly non-issuance of key fact statements to the borrowers under these two lending products and the deficiencies in the key fact statements issued in respect of other digital loans sanctioned by the company, the RBI said.

The agreement would help member countries like India to reduce their dependence on China and provide timely information to the IPEF member countries about potential supply disruptions.
The COVID outbreak severely disrupted the global supply chain, as most countries were dependent on China for various products like pharma raw materials.

The agreement was signed in San Francisco, where Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal is attending the ministerial meeting of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework For Prosperity (IPEF).
“India joins the US and 12 other IPEF partners to ink the IPEF Supply Chain Resilience Agreement, a first-of-its-kind international agreement that will fortify and strengthen global supply chains; and foster adaptability, stability and sustainability,” Goyal said in a post on the social networking platform X on Wednesday.
Members of the bloc concluded the negotiations on this agreement, one of the four pillars of the IPEF, on May 27 this year in Detroit.
The pact will also seek to improve crisis coordination and response to supply chain disruptions and work together to support the timely delivery of affected goods during a crisis.
ADVERTISEMENT
Three new IPEF Supply Chain bodies could be set up to facilitate cooperation among the partners. The bodies will be – the supply chain council; the supply chain crisis response network, and the IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board.
The other benefits of the pact include supply chain diversification, mobilisation of investments, deeper integration of India in global value chains, support to MSMEs and creation of a seamless regional trade ecosystem, which would facilitate the flow of Indian products.
The agreement was signed by the minister, along with the ministers from other IPEF partner countries, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking at the event, Goyal emphasised enhancing collaboration to realise the collective aims of the IPEF, particularly on the need for mobilising affordable financing for a clean economy transition and for enhancing technology cooperation.
Further, the ministers from IPEF partner countries also had productive discussions on the “substantial” progress made in clean and fair economy pillars.
IPEF was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year in Tokyo.
The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except the trade one.
The members are expected to announce the conclusion of talks for the clean economy and fair economy pillars during this week.

Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam are members of the bloc.
It would come into force after the implementation of the agreement by any of the five member countries.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to an official, the commerce ministry is expected to hold an outreach programme pan India for domestic industry, explaining the benefits of the agreement and how to utilise that.
Under the agreement, IPEF partners seek to provide a framework to build their collective understanding of significant supply chain risks; improve crisis coordination and response to supply chain disruptions; facilitate cooperation, mobilise investments, and promote regulatory transparency in sectors and goods critical to national security and public health and safety.
ADVERTISEMENT
The critical sectors will be identified by the member countries.
To implement and monitor the agreement, the bloc would set up the IPEF Supply Chain Council.
The council will meet every year, and all the members will have to report on the progress of the implementation of the agreement.
The crisis response network would deal with emergency issues, help partners seek support during a supply chain disruption and facilitate information sharing and collaboration among IPEF partners during a crisis, enabling a faster and more effective response that minimises negative effects on their economies.
On the other hand, the advisory board would help members in promoting labour rights in their supply chains.
Later in the day, when asked about labour issues in this agreement, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said it is basically the harmonisation of regulations on the subject.
“In this, we have agreed that labour is an important element wherever global value chains (GVCs) operate, and if investments have to come, labour regime is very important.
“But, what we have agreed is that it will be applicable as per the domestic labour laws. So, it is nothing beyond the domestic labour laws,” he told reporters here.
He said that it is basically a cooperative mechanism. So, there is no dispute settlement system.
If an investor from IPEF member countries feels that there is some inconsistency, then it will be bilaterally resolved under a cooperation framework, the secretary said.
“So, that is how things will be resolved. It is basically to strengthen the GVCs within the Asia Pacific,” he said, adding that for India to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), it is important that these value chains operate around a certain kind of regulatory regime.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-us-12-other-ipef-members-ink-supply-chain-resilience-agreement-9028191/,business

In the last 3-4 years, the total valuation of options of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) and its subsidiary Care Health Insurance Limited (CARE) to Saluja […]","Proxy advisory firm InGovern Research has raised a red flag against Religare Enterprises alleging “vested interest” of its Chairman Rashmi Saluja due to excessive remuneration as well as regulatory breaches.
In the last 3-4 years, the total valuation of options of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) and its subsidiary Care Health Insurance Limited (CARE) to Saluja is over Rs 480 crore, which is in addition to compensation paid at REL, said a report from InGovern.
Shares of CARE were issued to Saluja through ESOPs, despite rejection from IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) and no approval from the shareholders of REL was also taken for that, said InGovern in its report.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moreover, there was “no disclosure of CARE ESOPs in REL annual report as part of Saluja’s compensation,” it added.
A query sent to REL by PTI remained unanswered by the time of filing the story.
The proxy advisory firm suggested, “detailed investigations by IRDAI and SEBI needed on remuneration, conflicts of interest”.
A total of 1.05 crore options of REL have been granted to Saluja since her appointment in February 2020 as Executive Chairperson of the financial services holding company, which is valued over Rs 230 crores presently.
ADVERTISEMENT
While in CARE, where Saluja is a Non-Executive Chairperson has “excessive grants of stock options,” which are valued at over Rs 250 crores, it added.
In CARE, ESOPs of 2.27 crores in number were given to Saluja in January 2022, which was “in contravention of IRDAI regulations” which contemplate the issuance of stock options only to Chief Executive Officers, Whole-time Directors and Managing Directors.
These “were issued without waiting for the outcome of IRDAI approval sought for such issue”.
The insurance sector regulator had rejected the issue of ESOPs to Saluja as it was in breach of the regulatory limit of profit-related commission that can be paid up to Rs 10 lakh per annum to Non-Executive Directors of private sector insurers, InGovern Research report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“IRDAI also pointed out that the remuneration of Saluja post the ESOP issue would not be in line with remuneration of other NEDs of CARE,” said InGovern.
Moreover, ESOPs were at a deep discount with exercise price of Rs 45.32 per share of CARE.
With the share options, Saluja owns 2.50 per cent of the share capital of CARE.
While in REL, frequent resolutions have been tabled seeking shareholders’ approval to grant ESOPs and revise her remuneration within a very short span of time of three years.
Earlier, Burman family, which has made an open offer for REL, approached SEBI through its entities, seeking a probe into the sale of shares by Saluja on September 20, 2023, when they informed about the open offer.
ADVERTISEMENT
Religare however refuted the allegation of Saluja selling shares after being made aware of the open offer, saying the chairperson had sold ESOPs after a long process that was triggered several days prior to the September 20 meeting.
Burman family entities, which now collectively hold 21.24 per cent in REL, have written to the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regarding this also.

Burman family, a promoter of Dabur India and other entities such as Eveready Industries, through its entities, had in September announced a Rs 2,116 crore open offer to the shareholders of REL to acquire up to 26 per cent stake in the company.

India to emerge as third largest global economy by 2027: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,"""It is not without its geopolitical challenges and the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza is a worrying manifestation of these"": Nirmala Sitharaman on India-Middle East-Europe Connectivity Corridor (IMEC)","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said India is expected to overtake Japan and Germany to emerge as the third largest economy in the world by 2027.
Addressing the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue here, Sitharaman said India’s economic growth is estimated to be just under 7 per cent during the year, the highest among major economies, despite global headwinds.
The Indian economy is therefore on the right track and is heading towards a bright future, she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Amidst supply-chain disruptions and economic turbulence due to contemporary conflicts that impact the Indo-Pacific, irrespective of whether they are occurring in relatively distant Ukraine or in relatively-proximate Israel or Yemen, and despite the palpable tensions prevalent in the South- and East China Sea, the Indian economy stands out as a bright spot, she said.
In Opinion | P Chidambaram writes: Government in denial, economy in distress
“Even according to the usually conservative estimates of the IMF, the Indian economy is set to emerge as the world’s third largest economy by 2027, hopping over Japan and Germany, as its GDP crosses the USD 5 trillion level. By 2047, India aspires to be a developed economy,” she said.
Talking about India’s ‘Blue economy’, she said, it accounts for roughly 4 per cent of the GDP and represents a sea of opportunities.
India has 9 states and 4 Union Territories situated on the coast, 12 major and 200+ non-major ports situated along its coastline, and a vast network of navigable waterways for international and domestic trade, she said.

According to the UNCTAD, India was the second largest exporter of ocean-based goods and services among developing countries in 2020.
In Opinion | How the Indian economy has been navigating a changing world
Observing that Indo-Pacific is undoubtedly the world’s most economically dynamic region, Sitharaman said it encompasses 60 per cent of global GDP, and almost 50 per cent of global merchandise trade.
On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific is also a geopolitically contested space that is being roiled by great power competition, she said.

“One draws its legitimacy from an internationally accepted and consensually derived rules-based order. India stands firmly and proudly in the vanguard of this system,” she said.
While the other seeks to discredit and disrupt this consensually derived rules-based order and supplant it with an international order whose rules are generated in an exclusive State, she said.

As India accelerates its economic growth and uplifts its teeming masses, moving them from poverty to prosperity, she said it is registering impressive gains in its comprehensive national power as well as in terms of its international stature.
“Today, Indians ‘whether at home or abroad’ stand, walk, talk, and act with their heads held high… even as the world appreciates India’s achievements and successes and lauds it for its demonstrated resilience amidst multiple crises, we are very clear that we cannot afford to be an inward-leaning power,” she said.
“Our focus on transitioning from a ‘brown’ economic model to a ‘blue’ one and thereafter extrapolating this blue transition across the length and breadth of the Indo-Pacific demands that we shoulder greater and heavier regional responsibilities, and this is precisely what we are doing,” she said.

India has significantly improved its position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive environment for business, as reflected in several global indices.
Noting that the country’s comprehensive national power is going to remain inextricably linked to the ocean, she said India is seized of the pressing need to grow the maritime sector as a whole and the government is determined to provide the requisite support by way of fiscal policy and financial outlay.

“We seek to position India as a hub in new and diversified supply chains and value chains across the Indo-Pacific and, indeed, across the world.
“Towards this end, I am happy to inform you that all sectors of the government are responding exceedingly positively to our new financial policies,” she said.

In terms of international shipments, she said India’s global ranking has risen from 44th place in 2014, to the 22nd rank in 2023.
Similarly, as per the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index report 2023, she said, the ‘turn-around time’ of Indian ports is now just 0.9 days, which is lower than ports in established maritime centres such Singapore, the UAE, Germany, the USA, Australia, Russia, and South Africa.
“Our experience of the maritime manifestations of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shipping insurance, too, becoming a particular area of policy focus,” she said.
On the one hand, a ‘Marine Cargo Pool’ has now been created with the full support of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and domestic insurance companies, to support maritime trade on the other hand the country is improving its strength in shipping arbitration, and in order to reduce India’s vulnerability to international sanctions.
To provide greater strategic flexibility in shipping operations, she said “we are setting up a full-fledged Indian-owned and India-based Protection and Indemnity (P&I) entity that will additionally provide protection to coastal and inland shipping.” On the capacity building front, she said, as many as 31 projects have been identified in 9 major ports for monetisation under the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) launched in 2022, with a total estimated CAPEX of 14,483 crore rupees (1.74 billion US dollars) for FY 2022-25.
Terming India-Middle East-Europe Connectivity Corridor (IMEC) as one of the most promising connectivity projects, Sitharaman said it will be a win-win situation for all states involved, as it enhances transportation efficiency, reduces logistic costs, increases economic unity, generates employment, and lowers Greenhouse Gas emissions, contributing to a cleaner, safer, better world.
“However, it is not without its geopolitical challenges and the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza is a worrying manifestation of these,” she said.
The IMEC was signed at the 18th G-20 Summit held in New Delhi in September.
It is a multimodal economic corridor that incorporates multiple networks of shipping, railways, and roadways and will also include electricity cables, high-speed data cables, and a hydrogen pipeline.
The corridor is expected to create a reliable and cost-effective cross-border, ship-to-rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road transport, and facilitate trade and connectivity, leading to the economic integration of South Asia, West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-to-emerge-as-third-largest-global-economy-by-2027-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-9027648/,business

Airbus has yet to strike a major deal at the show, which comes as global airlines like Emirates have bounced back from the lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic with increased global demand for travel.

In his comments to journalists at the Emirates chalet on the runway of Al Maktoum International Airport, Clark raised concerns about the maintenance required for the Rolls Royce engines on the A350.
“If the engine was doing what we want it to do … then it would re-enter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan,” Clark said.
Airbus and Rolls Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.
Emirates is a heavyweight when it comes to East-West travel out of Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel.

Clark also said that Emirates needs to buy aircraft now as it moves forward with plans to expand its routes and networks.
“Irrespective of the difficulties of getting these aircraft out of the door, we have to place orders now because the lead time for deliveries are so long,” Clark said.
Clark also said that the tensions in the wider Middle East sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip wouldn’t affect Emirates’ business, adding they are used to working around the region’s geopolitical problems.

He said although the Israeli market was one of the fastest growing markets for Emirates, they had to stop their daily flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, but that the airline was able to absorb the demand fall-off.
Emirates and FlyDubai launched direct flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv after the two countries established diplomatic ties in 2020.
Two major Israeli firms — Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Aerospace Industries had been slated to participate in the Dubai Air Show. But the IAI stand, bearing the slogan “Where Courage Meets Technology,” was roped off and empty Monday. On Tuesday, a few people gathered there.
Also in the market for aircraft is Riyadh Air, a new Saudi carrier being created as part of trillions of dollars worth of spending planned in the kingdom. In March, the airline announced an order of up to 72 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jetliners and has further plans to expand.
Clark said he wasn’t worried about the competition, however.

“If Saudi Arabia wants to spend USD 2 trillion on doing wonderful things over there, they’ve got to have the labor from somewhere. And that labour force has got to be brought in, and their carriers are going to find it difficult in the early stages to meet that demand,” he said.
“So do I think it’s a problem with this lot? No, I don’t … because we managed to build Emirates through all of this competition, rising geopolitical socioeconomic difficulty.” The air show, which sees billions of dollars worth of deals, as arms manufacturers exhibit at the show, comes two weeks before Dubai hosts the United Nations’ COP28 climate talks.

Aviation has particularly drawn the ire of climate change activists, in part due to the amount of jet fuel the industry burns. Emirates in January successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. Earlier this month, the airline cleared SAF for flights, including one to Sydney, Australia.
However, “decarbonizing civil aviation is incredibly difficult and will be long term,” Clark said.

Meanwhile Tuesday, other purchases included: — Emirates announced USD 1.2 billion in deals with French firm Safran, including for seats.
— Emirates announced plans for a USD 950 million maintenance facility at Al Maktoum International Airport, the city-state’s second airfield.
— EgyptAir announced it would buy 10 Airbus A350-900s. It did not disclose the price of the aircraft.
— Boeing and SCAT Airlines of Kazakhstan announced the airline would purchase seven Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. It also did not disclose terms for the sale.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/long-haul-carrier-emirates-signals-hold-off-airbus-purchase-engine-worries-9026472/,business

A negative wholesale inflation though could result in a lower nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with some estimates pegging it to not be over 9 per cent due to slower GDP deflator that has a significant weight of WPI. The lower nominal GDP growth could result in fiscal slippage risk, with the government’s fiscal deficit estimates calculated as a percentage of the GDP.

The minister is in the US on a four-day visit. The world’s largest electric car producer Tesla Inc’s chief Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June in New York and after the meeting Musk had said that he planned to visit India in 2024.

“Visited @Tesla’s state of the art manufacturing facility at Fremont, California. Extremely delighted to see talented Indian engineers and finance professionals working at Senior positions and contributing to Tesla’s remarkable journey to transform mobility.
“Also proud to see the growing importance of auto component suppliers from India in the Tesla EV supply chain. It is on its way to double its components imports from India. Missed Mr @ElonMusk’s magnetic presence and I wish him a speedy recovery,” Goyal said on social networking platform X.
The platform is also owned by Musk.

The visit comes amid reports that India is looking at giving customs duty concessions to Tesla for setting up a plant in the country. In September, Goyal said the company is looking to source components worth around USD 1.9 billion from India this year against USD 1 billion in 2022.
Going forward, demand for electric vehicles will increase and it will help in pushing the growth of the sector. Earlier, the government had stated that it is not looking to frame a separate policy for providing incentives to Tesla, and the company can apply to avail support measures under existing schemes like PLI for auto and advanced chemistry cells.
Replying to the minister on the platform, Musk said :”It was an honor to have you visit Tesla! My apologies for not being able to travel to California today, but I look forward to meeting at a future date”.
The government has rolled out production-linked incentives (PLI) schemes (PLI) for advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery storage with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore and Rs 26,058 crore PLI scheme for auto, auto-components and drone industries.

When asked whether the government is considering duty concessions on completely built-up units to attract certain sections of electric cars into India, Goyal in September had said that “everything we have done has been done equally without any differentiation, without any preferences. This is the government which provides equal opportunity to everybody. So we will come out with a policy”.
In August 2021, Musk had said Tesla might set up a manufacturing unit in India if it first succeeded with imported vehicles in the country. He had said Tesla wanted to launch its vehicles in India “but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country!”.
Currently, India imposes 100 per cent import duty on fully imported cars with CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) value more than USD 40,000 and 70 per cent on those costing less than the amount.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/piyush-goyal-tesla-manufacturing-facility-california-9025990/,business

Raymond’s billionaire head Gautam Singhania announces separation from wife,"Singhania, the chairman and managing director of Raymond, who's net worth is reported to be over Rs 11,000 crore, made the announcement over the microblogging platform X, saying it is not the same Diwali as in the past.","Billionaire industrialist Gautam Singhania on Monday said he has separated from his wife Nawaz, in an announcement that comes amid speculation over the future of the 32-year relationship.
Singhania, the chairman and managing director of Raymond, who’s net worth is reported to be over Rs 11,000 crore, made the announcement over the microblogging platform X, saying it is not the same Diwali as in the past.
The industrialist, who is helming the multi-decade group having roots in textiles and branched out into newer ones like real estate, said Nawaz, a fitness trainer, and he were together for 32 years as a couple.
ADVERTISEMENT
The couple has two children and Singhania said they grew together in their years of companionship and were a source of strength for each other.
“We traversed with commitment, resolve, faith as along came the two most beautiful additions of our lives,” he wrote.
The announcement came minutes after a video surfaced online which purportedly shows Nawaz allegedly not being allowed to enter a party hosted by Singhania at Thane last week despite an invite for the pre-Diwali bash.
In his post, Singhania made a mention of “unfortunate developments in the recent past”, and added that there has been a lot of “unsubstantiated rumour mongering and gossip” fanned by what he called as “not so well wishers”.
ADVERTISEMENT
Singhania did not give details of the separation and custody of their two children, and sought privacy and respect for personal decisions in the post.
“It is my belief that Nawaz and I will pursue different paths from here on,” he said, adding that both the parents are committed to do whatever is the best for their two children.
Nawaz, the daughter of a well known lawyer, also studied law but opened a gym in a tony neighbourhood. She was reported to have dated Singhania, who loves fast cars, for eight years before the marriage in 1999.

Minutes before announcing the separation, Gautam Singhania wrote on X about his group’s real estate arm continuing to expand its presence across Mumbai.
“We have secured 3 new real estate projects in the (Mumbai Metropolitan) Region, with a combined revenue potential of over Rs 5,000 crore (USD 678 million).
“Our realty business has seen a strong growth trajectory over the last couple of projects and we are confident of delivering on the highest level of quality and finesse associated with Raymond Group for the upcoming projects,” he said.
Singhania was in news a couple of years back over a feud with his father Vijaypat. Vijaypat Singhania created Raymond Group, which became a household name in India, producing apparels brands and textiles. His son, Guatam diversified the group into more sectors in an attempt to widen the revenue.

Hailing from Bikaner, his family owned a sweet shop in the bylanes of the city since 1905. The shop was named as Bikaner Namkeen Bhandar and used to sell a few varieties of sweets and snacks.
Aggarwal, who had larger ambitions, migrated to Delhi in the early 50s along with his brother Satyanarayan Aggarwal, bringing his family recipe to the city.
Initially, both struggled with carrying buckets filled with bhujia and rasgulla, selling in the streets of old Delhi.
However, the Aggarwal brothers’ hard work and the unique taste of Bikaner soon gained recognition and acceptance among the people of Delhi.

Later Aggarwal brothers set up a shop in Delhi’s Chandini Chowk, where they used their family recipes which were handed down from generation to generation.
Bikaner Namkeen Bhandar soon became famous for its Moong Dal Halwa, Bikaneri Bhujia and Kaju Katli, amongst others. The two brothers and the shop soon became popular as Bikanervala.
“As we bid farewell to a legend, we carry forward his legacy with a deep sense of responsibility.

Long-haul carrier Emirates opens Dubai Air Show with $52 billion aircraft purchase from Boeing,"Turkish Airlines may also make a record-shattering purchase of 355 aircraft from Airbus, including 250 A321neo aircraft, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.","Long-haul carrier Emirates opened the Dubai Air Show with a $52 billion purchase of Boeing Co. aircraft, showing how aviation has bounced back after the groundings of the coronavirus pandemic, and even as Israel’s war with Hamas clouds regional security.
That conflict, as well as Russia’s war on Ukraine, likely will influence the five-day show at Al Maktoum Airport at Dubai World Central. It is the city-state’s second airfield after Dubai International Airport, which is the world’s busiest for international travel and home base for the long-haul carrier Emirates.
Emirates made the announcement witnessed by the crown prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, at a news conference Monday afternoon.

While commercial aviation takes much of the attention, arms manufacturers also have exhibitions at the show. Two major Israeli firms — Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Aerospace Industries had been slated to participate. But the IAI stand, bearing the slogan “Where Courage Meets Technology,” was roped off and empty Monday morning as people poured into the show. A stand for Rafael handed out coffee, though there were no salespeople there.
A request for comment left with an attendant there was not immediately returned. Rafael also sponsored a meeting of air force commanders Sunday at a luxury Dubai hotel, highlighting the balancing act being struck by the UAE amid anger in the Arab world over the Israel-Hamas war. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020.
The firm Russian Helicopters will likely have staff on hand for the air show after appearing at the Abu Dhabi arms fair earlier this year despite being sanctioned by the US and others over Moscow’s attack on Ukraine. ROSCOSMOS, the Russian state space company, is also at the show. Global aviation is booming after the coronavirus pandemic saw worldwide lockdowns and aircraft grounded — particularly at Al Maktoum Airport, which served for months as a parking lot for Emirates double-decker Airbus 380s.
Air traffic is now at 97% of pre-COVID levels, according to the International Air Transport Association. Middle Eastern airlines, which supply key East-West routes for global travel, saw a 26.6% increase in September traffic compared to a year earlier, IATA says.

Emirates, a main economic engine for Dubai amid its booming real estate market, announced record half-year profits of $2.7 billion Thursday.
That is up from $1.2 billion for the same period last year, potentially putting the airline on track for another record-breaking year. The airline says it has repaid some $2.5 billion of the loans it received during the height of the pandemic to stay afloat. Tim Clark, president of Emirates, told Bloomberg in September to “watch this space” when it comes to purchases from both Airbus and Boeing during the air show.
The airline is hiring a slew of new pilots and crew, likely to staff new aircraft. “We’ve got a lot of big plans for the airline going forward,” Clark said. “New fleet, larger numbers, larger network.” Also in the market is Riyadh Air, a new Saudi carrier being created as part of trillions of dollars worth of spending planned in the kingdom.

"Airports to Metro, how non-core businesses bring firms more money","Across key transport infrastructure segments, non-core revenue streams are assuming growing significance as operators look to diversify revenue to de-risk businesses and subsidise core operations to keep services economical for consumers.","Mega airports like Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport should not just be seen as airports, but also mega shopping and hospitality centres and integrated real estate developments. Reason: their non-aeronautical revenues have steadily grown over the past few years, and now account for the lion’s share of the their overall revenues.
Similarly, Delhi Metro, in addition to being a mass rapid transit system, is also a project consultant and revenues from this earns more for the transporter than its core passenger operations. And for the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), its relatively new e-ticketing services generated far more profits than its core catering and bottled water business in FY23, even though it accounted for a smaller share of the revenue pie.

With cash remaining the preferred mode of payment, currency with public for the fortnight ended October 20, 2023 stood at Rs 32.01 lakh crore, down by Rs 74,728 crore in the current financial year so far.
The decline is mainly due to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to withdraw the Rs 2,000 denomination notes from circulation on May 19 this year. While the value of Rs 2,000 notes was at Rs 3.62 lakh crore when the withdrawal was announced, notes worth Rs 10,000 crore notes are yet to come back to the RBI.

"FPIs selling spree continues; pull out Rs 5,800 cr from equities in November","Before the outflow, FPIs were incessantly buying Indian equities in the last six months from March to August and brought in Rs 1.74 lakh crore during the period.","Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) selling spree continued as they dumped Indian equity worth over Rs 5,800 crore this month so far on rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
This came after such investors withdrew Rs 24,548 crore in October and Rs 14,767 crore in September, data with the depositories showed.
Before the outflow, FPIs were incessantly buying Indian equities in the last six months from March to August and brought in Rs 1.74 lakh crore during the period.

Going forward, this selling trend is unlikely to continue as the US Federal Reserve signalled a dovish stance in its meeting last week, experts said.
According to the data with the depositories, FPIs sold shares to the tune of Rs 5,805 crore during November 1-10.
The FPI selling trend which started in September continued in October and is showing no signs of reversing in November even though the intensity of selling has come down this month.
This could be largely attributed to the growing geo-political tensions due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, alongside a notable rise in US Treasury bond yields, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said.
In the current scenario, experts believe that there could be an enhanced focus on safe-haven assets such as gold and US dollars.

On the other hand, the debt market attracted Rs 6,053 crore in the period under review after receiving Rs 6,381 crore in October, data showed.
This approach may represent a tactical move by foreign investors to allocate funds to Indian debt in the short term, with the intention of redirecting capital into the equity markets when conditions become more favourable, Morningstar’s Srivastava said.
The inclusion of Indian G-Sec in the JP Morgan Government Bond Index Emerging Markets has spurred foreign fund participation in the Indian bond markets.

With this, the total investment by FPIs in equity has reached Rs 90,161 crore and Rs 41,554 crore in the debt market so far this year.
In terms of sectors, FPIs continue selling in financials despite their impressive Q2 results and bright prospects. In this time of uncertainty, FPIs are looking for the safety of the risk-free US bond yields where the 10-year is yielding around 4.64 per cent, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.
The sustained selling by FPIs in financials has made the valuations of banking stocks attractive.
“In the run-up to the General elections, a rally in the stock market is likely as happened during the last five general elections. Leading banking stocks have the potential to outperform in the imminent rally,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/fpis-selling-spree-continues-equities-november-9023552/,business

A quick guide to investing in gold this Dhanteras,"Gold ETFs offer many benefits such as allowing you to add gold to your portfolio without the challenges of investing in physical gold, and the potential of earning a profit when the price of the metal appreciates.","Planning to invest in gold this Dhanteras? From physical gold in the form of jewellery to digital investments via products such a Gold ETFs, or Sovereign Gold Bonds, here’s a guide for you to take an informed decision before investing.
Buying physical gold
Gold has always been a means of liquid investment, against which one can also borrow money as mean of a loan. However, investing in physical gold comes with its challenges, especially regarding its storage and safety. Jewellers also levy labour charges when making gold jewellery, which you cannot recover when selling it.

Also, note that the resale value of gold bars or coins may be higher than that of physical gold.

"‘High inverted duty structure, raw material cost curbing competitiveness’: Engineering goods exporters to parliamentary standing committee on commerce",An inverted duty structure refers to a situation where taxes on input items are higher compared to the final product resulting in a drag in export competitiveness.,"At a time when India is negotiating free trade agreements (FTA) with highly competitive markets such as the UK and European Union, Indian engineering goods manufacturers have explicitly flagged the issue of inverted duty structure in GST rates and the high raw material costs draining their competitiveness. An industry group representing over 12,000 engineering goods exporters said this is a submission to the parliamentary standing committee on commerce last month.
An inverted duty structure refers to a situation where taxes on input items are higher compared to the final product resulting in a drag in export competitiveness. India has already signed a limited trade deal (an early harvest deal) with Australia and a comprehensive trade deal with the UAE, where duties are among the lowest in the world. Exporters, thereby, are faced with stiff rivalry from established players, especially the Chinese, for market access, despite the duty elimination following the trade deal.

"GST revenue up due to economic activity, not notices: CBIC Chairman",He also said the department will soon start sending advisories to businesses who are non-compliant in issuing e-invoices to their B2B customers.,"The rise in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in October has been on account of economic activity and not due to notices being issued by tax authorities, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said Wednesday. He also said the department will soon start sending advisories to businesses who are non-compliant in issuing e-invoices to their B2B customers.
“The growth in October GST collections was riding on economic activity and not because of notices that were sent (to online gaming companies)…notices were sent because of the time limitation which was coming to an end for the year 2017-18. So it’s not because of that. Also, the notices issued to online gaming companies are in dispute but the growth has come purely on the economic activity which has taken place in the country,” Agarwal said at the sidelines of the DPIIT-CII National Conference on Ease of Doing Business.

According to Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive, the geopolitical risk premium is getting digested out. “As central banks turned away from rate hikes, it is ultimately pushing yields lower. So, there’s not much of driving catalysts for gold this week,” Spivak said.
Most of the Fed officials on Tuesday refrained from giving out a hint about the central bank’s next decision, but noted they would focus on more economic data and the impact of higher long-term bond yields.
As per the according to the CME, FedWatch tool, futures point to a roughly 15% chance of another rate hike by January. There’s a 20% chance that cuts could come as early as March, it predicted.

"Cheaper Russian oil helped Indian refiners save $3.3 billion in first half of FY24, data shows",India is the world's third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85% of its requirement. Crude oil also tops the list of India’s merchandise imports by value.,"Indian refiners are estimated to have saved around $3.3 billion in the first half of the current financial year (FY24) through their purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, shows an analysis of India’s official trade data for April-September. Russia, which used to be a marginal supplier of crude to India before the war in Ukraine, was New Delhi’s largest source of oil in April-September, accounting for almost 39 per cent of India’s overall oil imports by volume and nearly 36 per cent by value.
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85% of its requirement. Crude oil also tops the list of India’s merchandise imports by value. With Western buyers cutting oil imports from Russia in the wake of its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow started offering deep discounts on its crude. Indian refiners have been lapping up these discounted barrels, catapulting Russia to the top spot among New Delhi’s oil suppliers.
The total value of India’s oil imports for the first six months of the ongoing financial year was $63.86 billion. Had Indian refiners paid for Russian oil the average per-barrel price they paid for crude from all other suppliers put together, the oil import bill would have been $67.14 billion, shows the analysis by The Indian Express. The value of oil imports from Russia for the period was $22.84 billion. In terms of volumes, India imported a total of 111.51 million tonnes, or 817.35 million barrels, of crude oil in April-September. Oil imports from Russia for the period stood at 43.38 million tonnes, or 317.96 million barrels.
ADVERTISEMENT
The average landed price of Russian crude for Indian refiners for the April-September period was $71.83 per barrel, $10.32 lower than the average landed price of non-Russian barrels, as per the analysis. It translates into an effective discount of 12.6 per cent to the average price of oil imported from other supplying nations.
In the overall scheme of India’s foreign trade, $3.3 billion may not appear to be a significant amount, but the savings are substantial for the country’s major oil importers–Indian refiners like Indian Oil Corporation, Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan petroleum Corporation, and Nayara Energy.
The government releases commodity-wise and country-wise trade data with a lag, and so far, data till September has been made available. While the price of crude oil depends on grades and their prices can vary substantially, the average landed price of crude and import volumes from the supplying countries were used for computations as the government does not release grade-wise data.
In April-September, Iraq was India’s second-biggest oil supplier with a market share of 20.4 per cent by volume, followed by Saudi Arabia with a 14.3 per cent share. Prior to the war in Ukraine, Iraq was India’s top supplier of crude oil, followed by Saudi Arabia. In the corresponding six months of last year, Iraq and Saudi Arabia accounted for 24.2 per cent and 17.9 per cent, respectively, of India’s crude oil imports by volume. Russia was in the third spot with a share of 15.8 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Compared to the next four major suppliers of crude to India during the first half of the current financial year, the landed price of Russian oil was at discounts ranging between 6.3 per cent–in the case of Iraq–and 19.3 per cent–in the case of Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the fourth-biggest supplier of crude to India during the period and Russian crude was 18.8 per cent cheaper than oil supplied by the former. In the fifth spot was the United States (US), and Russian oil supplies to India were at an average discount of 18.9 per cent to US crude, the computations show.
The effective discounts, while significant from the point of view of Indian refiners, are not as high as what had been initially anticipated. Relatively higher cost of freight and insurance for Russian crude as compared to oil from other suppliers is seen as the most likely reason. Most of Russian oil bought by Indian refiners is on delivered basis, which means that shipping and insurance is arranged by the seller. With Moscow facing Western sanctions over the Ukraine war, freight and insurance costs for ferrying Russian oil shot up. This suggests that while the discounts might have been deeper on the actual price of oil, the effective discount on landed price, which includes freight and insurance costs, was much lower.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/cheaper-russian-oil-helped-indian-refiners-save-3-3-billion-in-first-half-of-fy24-data-shows-9018022/,business

"Air India-Vistara merger remains on course, says Singapore Airlines","Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines (SIA) will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India","Singapore Airlines on Tuesday said the proposed merger of Air India and Vistara “remains on course” and is subject to approvals from regulators as well as competition authorities in several jurisdictions.
Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines (SIA) will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India. Currently, Singapore Airlines owns a 49 per cent shareholding in Vistara and the remaining 51 per cent stake is with the Tata Group.
“The proposed merger of Air India and Vistara remains on course, with the Competition Commission of India approving the transaction in September 2023.

“It remains subject to foreign direct investment approval, as well as approvals from other regulators and competition authorities in several jurisdictions including those from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Civil Aviation, and National Company Law Tribunal, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore,” SIA Group said in a release on Tuesday.
While announcing the group’s financial performance for the first half of the financial year 2023-24, SIA also said that when the merger is complete, it will get a 25.1 per cent stake in an enlarged Air India Group with a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments.
India is one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets and Air India, which was acquired by Tata Group in January 2022, has embarked on an ambitious revival and expansion plan.
In the first half of the 2023-24 fiscal, SIA Group reported a 55.4 per cent jump in net profit to SGD 1,441 million from USD 927 million in the year-ago period.
ADVERTISEMENT
Its total revenue jumped 8.9 per cent to SGD 9,162 million from SGD 8,417 million in the same period a year ago.
As of September 30, the group had an operating fleet of 202 aircraft comprising 195 passenger aircraft and 7 freighters. SIA’s operating fleet comprised 140 passenger aircraft and 7 freighters while Scoot had 55 passenger aircraft.
The Group has 96 aircraft on order.
Industry-wise, SIA said robust demand for air travel continued into the Northern Summer travel season, led by the rebound in passenger traffic to North Asia with the full reopening of China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Taiwan.
ADVERTISEMENT
SIA and non-frill carrier Scoot carried 17.4 million passengers in the first six months of the current fiscal, an increase of 52.3 per cent year-on-year. Passenger traffic grew 38 per cent from a year before.
“For the Northern Summer 2024 operating season (31 March 2024 to 26 October 2024), SIA will ramp up services to destinations across its network. This includes restoring Airbus A380 services to Frankfurt, deploying widebody Airbus A350-900 medium-haul aircraft to Cairns and Male, and reinstating direct services between Singapore and Barcelona.
“Flight frequencies will be increased to reach or exceed pre-pandemic levels across multiple points. These include Ahmedabad (India), Beijing and Shanghai (China), Copenhagen (Denmark), Da Nang (Vietnam), Darwin, Melbourne, and Perth (Australia), Dubai (the United Arab Emirates), Tokyo-Haneda (Japan), and Seattle and Houston (the United States of America),” the release said.
According to SIA, the demand for air freight remained soft due to inventory overhang, as well as geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Increased competition and softer demand also contributed to the downward pressure on cargo yields, which fell by 46.2 per cent from a year before, it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/air-india-vistara-merger-remains-on-course-says-singapore-airlines-9017551/,business

"India will not accept unfair taxes on steel, aluminum industry: Goyal on EU’s carbon tax",He said India has already flagged its concerns over the carbon tax with the European Union (EU) and in the WTO (World Trade Organization).,"Expressing serious concerns over the European Union’s move to impose carbon tax on imports from certain sectors like steel, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday assured the domestic industry that India will not accept such unfair taxes and will fight to get a fair deal for producers and exporters.
He said India has already flagged its concerns over the carbon tax with the European Union (EU) and in the WTO (World Trade Organization).
The CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) or carbon tax (a kind of import duty) will come into effect from January 1, 2026, but from October 1 this year, domestic companies from seven carbon-intensive sectors, including steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and hydrocarbon products, will have to share data with regard to carbon emissions with the EU.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I will assure you that we are extremely concerned about CBAM…We are taking it up with the WTO very very seriously. We shall try to work and fight to get a fair deal for the Indian producers and exporters and nobody is complacent about CBAM,” he said here at a function of the steel industry.
The minister said the world will have to take a view on this tax and India would onboard other countries on the issue to address this “very serious” concern.
“We will always find innovative solutions but I can assure you that India will not be accepting unfair taxes or levies being put on the Indian steel or aluminum industry or any other industry,” he said adding “let us not be scared of it and find solutions which will be to our advantage going forward”.
He said the EU would have to allow “common but differentiated responsibility” to India on the issue as New Delhi is a developing economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a report of think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), CBAM will translate into a 20-35 per cent tax on select imports into the EU starting January 1, 2026.
India’s 26.6 per cent of exports of iron ore pellets, iron, steel, and aluminium products go to the EU. These products would be hit by CBAM. India exported these goods worth USD 7.4 billion in 2023 to the EU.
Further, he said the government is working to provide better access to its steel industry in different countries through free trade agreements (FTAs).
ADVERTISEMENT
To protect domestic steel players from dumping, India is including provisions like “high” value-added norms and “melt and pour” in these agreements.
“We are looking at both the options so that our steel industry gets protected from any dumping from the developed world,” he said adding these provisions would deter countries from misuse of FTAs.
He also asked the industry to provide information about businesses who are importing that steel which is available here at competitive prices as such irrational imports hurt domestic manufacturing and demand.
Talking about the steel production, Goyal expressed hope that the target of doubling the production to about 300 million tonne per year would be achieved by 2030.
On coking coal, he said the industry should work on some alternatives in this direction to cut down these imports as research and development, and smart ideas will help handle the issue and it would also lead to sustainable production practices.

"WeWork, once most valuable US startup, succumbs to bankruptcy",Profitability has remained elusive as WeWork grapples with its expensive leases and corporate clients cancelling because some employees work from home.,"WeWork, the SoftBank Group -backed startup whose meteoric rise and fall reshaped the office sector globally, sought US bankruptcy protection on Monday, after its bets on companies using more of its office-sharing space soured.
The move represents an admission by SoftBank, the Japanese technology group that owns about 60% of WeWork and has invested billions of dollars in its turnaround, that the company cannot survive unless it renegotiates its pricey leases in bankruptcy.
Profitability has remained elusive as WeWork grapples with its expensive leases and corporate clients cancelling because some employees work from home. Paying for space consumed 74% of WeWork’s revenue in the second quarter of 2023.

The company reported estimated assets and liabilities ranging from $10 billion to $50 billion, according to a bankruptcy filing.
“WeWork could use provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code to rid itself of onerous leases,” law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP said in a note to landlords on its website in August. Some landlords are bracing for a significant impact.

Under its founder Adam Neumann, WeWork grew to be the most valuable U.S. startup, worth $47 billion. It attracted investments from bluechip investors, including SoftBank and venture capital firm Benchmark, as well as the backing of major Wall Street Banks, including JPMorgan Chase.
Neumann’s pursuit of breakneck growth at the expense of profits, and revelations about his eccentric behavior, led to his ouster and the derailment of an initial public offering in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
SoftBank was forced to double down on its investment in WeWork, and tapped real estate veteran Sandeep Mathrani as the startup’s CEO. In 2021, SoftBank cut a deal to take WeWork public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company at an $8 billion valuation.
WeWork managed to amend 590 leases, saving about $12.7 billion in fixed lease payments. But this was not enough to compensate for the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which kept office workers at home.
Many of its landlords, who were also feeling the squeeze, had little incentive to give WeWork a break on the terms of their leases.
While WeWork had some success in signing up large conglomerates as clients, many of its customers were startups and smaller businesses, which cut their spending as inflation soared and economic prospects soured.
ADVERTISEMENT
Adding to WeWork’s woes was competition from its own landlords. Commercial property companies that traditionally only entered into long-term rent agreements started offering short and flexible leases to cope with the downturn in the office sector.
Mathrani was succeeded as WeWork CEO this year by former investment banker and private equity executive David Tolley, who as chief executive of Intelsat helped the debt-stricken satellite communications provider emerge from bankruptcy in 2022.
WeWork engaged in debt restructurings, yet this was not enough to stave off its bankruptcy. The company last week secured a seven-day extension from its creditors on an interest payment, to win more time to negotiate with them.

"‘Not much impact on the fisc from the five-year extension of food grains subsidy, crude surge a bigger worry’","The bigger challenge being seen by the government is the rise in global crude oil prices, but the Centre is confident of meeting its fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of the GDP for financial year 2023-24, another senior government official said.","The government does not see “much fiscal impact” from the just announced five-year extension of the food grains subsidy scheme, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKAY), a top government official said Monday, without pegging a figure for the absolute impact of the scheme. The bigger challenge being seen by the government is the rise in global crude oil prices, but the Centre is confident of meeting its fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of the GDP for financial year 2023-24, another senior government official said.
“There is no major fiscal impact seen for five years (from the food grains subsidy extension),” the official said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a pre-election rally in Chhattisgarh, announced that the central government would continue to provide free foodgrains to beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013 for the next five years. The PMGKAY was to end this December. The extension of the free ration scheme is expected to benefit around 80 crore people and could be a key element of the BJP’s 2024 Lok Sabha campaign narrative.

Fitch hikes India’s medium-term GDP growth estimate by 70 bps to 6.2%.

The prime minister disbursed seed capital assistance to over one lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs) and inaugurated a ‘food street’ as part of ‘World Food India 2023′.
The event aims to showcase India as ‘food basket of the world’ and celebrate 2023 as International Year of Millets. The first edition was held in 2017, but in consecutive years the international event could not be organised due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“In the last nine years, the sector has attracted FDI of Rs 50,000 crore. This happened because of the government’s pro-industry and pro-farmer policies,” Modi said.
He highlighted some of the measures, like production linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and establishment of mega food parks, which his government has taken towards further development of the food processing sector.
Modi also said investments of about Rs 50,000 crore has been made to set up post-crop harvest related infrastructure projects under a central scheme (Agri Infra Fund).

He said millets are a key component of the ‘superfood bucket’, and called for diversification in the food basket of the country’s public distribution system.

“Now is the time to diversify the food basket of the public distribution,” Modi said.

iPhone revenue came in ahead of the company’s expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India, he said.
Responding to a question on a comparison between Apple’s growth momentum in India and China over the years, Cook said “each country has its own journey” and he “wouldn’t want to play the comparison game.” Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that the company is “particularly pleased” with its performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency.

“We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile,” Maestri said.
Cook was in India in April, his first trip to the country in seven years, to open Apple’s first official retail store in the country in Mumbai, followed by the launch of a second store in New Delhi.

Ex-crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of multi-billion dollar FTX fraud,FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Thursday of stealing from customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange in one of the biggest financial frauds on record.,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Thursday of stealing from customers of his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange in one of the biggest financial frauds on record, a verdict that cemented the 31-year-old former billionaire’s fall from grace. A 12-member jury in Manhattan federal court convicted Bankman-Fried on all seven counts he faced after a monthlong trial in which prosecutors made the case that he looted $8 billion from the exchange’s users out of sheer greed. The verdict came just shy of one year after FTX filed for bankruptcy in a swift corporate meltdown that shocked financial markets and erased his estimated $26 billion personal fortune.
The jury reached the verdict after just over four hours of deliberations. Bankman-Fried, who had pleaded not guilty to two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy, stood facing the jury with his hands clasped in front of him as the verdict was read. The conviction was a victory for the U.S. Justice Department and Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, who made rooting out corruption in financial markets one of his top priorities.
“The crypto industry might be new, the players like Sam Bankman-Fried may be new, but this kind of fraud is as old as time and we have no patience for it,” Williams told reporters outside the courthouse.

Once the darling of the crypto world, Bankman-Fried – who was known for his mop of unkempt curly hair and for wearing shorts and T-shirts rather than business attire – joins the likes of admitted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and “Wolf of Wall Street” fraudster Jordan Belfort as notable people convicted of major U.S. financial crimes.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan set Bankman-Fried’s sentencing for March 28, 2024. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate could face decades in prison.
His defense lawyer Mark Cohen said in a statement that he was “disappointed” but respected the jury’s decision.
“Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
After Kaplan left the courtroom, Cohen put his arm around Bankman-Fried as they spoke at the defense table. As Bankman-Fried was led away by members of the U.S. Marshals service, he turned around and nodded at his parents, the Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who were seated in the courtroom audience’s front row. Fried looked toward him and crossed her arm across her chest. Bankman-Fried is set to go on trial next March on a second set of charges brought by prosecutors earlier this year, including for alleged foreign bribery and bank fraud conspiracies.
BANKMAN-FRIED TESTIFIED IN OWN DEFENSE
Bankman-Fried’s was the first of several blockbuster cases Williams brought against former high-flying cryptocurrency executives to go to trial. Several crypto companies went bankrupt last year after the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets collapsed following a years-long boom.
Prosecutors argued during the trial that Bankman-Fried siphoned money from FTX to his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, despite proclaiming on social media and in television advertisements that the exchange prioritized the safety of customer funds.
ADVERTISEMENT
Alameda used the money to pay its lenders and to make loans to Bankman-Fried and other executives – who in turn made speculative venture investments and donated upwards of $100 million to U.S. political campaigns in a bid to promote cryptocurrency legislation the defendant viewed as favorable to his business, according to prosecutors.
Bankman-Fried took the calculated risk of testifying in his own defense over three days near the close of trial after three former members of his inner circle testified against him. He faced aggressive cross-examination by the prosecution, often avoiding direct answers to the most probing questions.
He testified that while he made mistakes running FTX, such as not formulating a risk-management team, he did not steal customer funds. He said he thought Alameda’s borrowing from FTX was allowed and did not realize how large its debts had grown until shortly before both companies collapsed.
“We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,” Bankman-Fried testified. “It turned out basically the opposite of that.”
‘HE THOUGHT THE RULES DID NOT APPLY’
Prosecutors had a different view.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He didn’t bargain for his three loyal deputies taking that stand and telling you the truth: that he was the one with the plan, the motive and the greed to raid FTX customer deposits – billions and billions of dollars – to give himself money, power, influence. He thought the rules did not apply to him. He thought that he could get away with it,” prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the jury on Thursday. The jury heard 15 days of testimony. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, testifying for the prosecution after entering guilty pleas, said he directed them to commit crimes, including helping Alameda loot FTX and lying to lenders and investors about the companies’ finances.
The defense argued the three, who have not yet been sentenced, falsely implicated Bankman-Fried in a bid to win leniency at sentencing. Prosecutors may ask Kaplan to take their cooperation into account in deciding their punishment.

‘Violent extremist organisation’ in India collected funds through well-structured networks: FATF report,"India’s onsite assessment by FATF is slated for November, while the assessment is likely to come up for discussion in the plenary discussion in June 2024.","A “violent extremist organisation under investigation” in India collected funds through “well-structured networks” including offline and online fundraising mechanisms such as circulating QR codes and account details, a latest report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has stated. Without naming the organisation, the FATF report makes a reference to the Popular Front of India (PFI) as having resorted to solicitation for funds at mosques and public places, which were ultimately used to procure arms and ammunition and for training the cadres.
“Indian officials reported that a violent extremist organisation under investigation collected funds through well-structured networks spanning the entire country. Resorting to solicitation at mosques and public places, the group’s fundraising tactics included offline and online mechanisms, such as circulating QR codes and account details through which donors were asked to send money.

"Bank of England keep rates at 15-year high, rules out quick cuts to help economy","In September, the Bank had said rates would need to remain ""sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long.""","The Bank of England held interest rates at a 15-year peak as it kept up its fight against the highest inflation among the world’s big rich economies, and it stressed that it did not expect to cut them any time soon.
Despite publishing forecasts which now show the British economy now skirting close to a recession and flat-lining in the coming years, the BoE held Bank Rate at 5.25% for the second meeting in a row after 14 back-to-back increases.
It also reinforced its message that borrowing costs were set to stay high, even though only about half of the impact of its long run of rate hikes have been felt in the economy so far.
ADVERTISEMENT

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-3 to keep Bank Rate on hold, in line with economists’ expectations in a Reuters poll.
“The MPC’s latest projections indicate that monetary policy is likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time,” the BoE said. “Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressure.”
In September, the BoE had said rates would need to remain “sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long.”
Governor Andrew Bailey also tried to hammer home the message that inflation’s fall over the past year from its highest since the 1980s and the weaker economic outlook should not be seen as a sign that rate cuts might soon be on the table, and a more likely possibility was another rate hike.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We need to see inflation continuing to fall all the way to our 2% target,” Bailey said in a statement.
“We’ve held rates unchanged this month, but we’ll be watching closely to see if further rate increases are needed. It’s much too early to be thinking about rate cuts.”
The decision to keep rates on hold echoed moves by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve over the past week. They are also waiting to see if their strong dose of rate hike medicine will curb the world’s worst outbreak of inflation in decades.
ADVERTISEMENT
Policymakers are also watching for any signs that the conflict in the Middle East causes a fresh round of higher inflation as it pushes up oil and gas prices.
MPC members Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann voted to raise rates to 5.5%.
Sarah Breeden voted to keep rates on hold at her first meeting as an MPC member since replacing Jon Cunliffe.
Flat-lining Economy
The BoE has said it is determined to stamp out the risk of a damaging spiral of higher pay and prices.
Although inflation has fallen from 11.1% just over a year ago to 6.7% in the most recent data, it remains more than three times the BoE’s 2% target.
ADVERTISEMENT
The central bank said it now expected Britain’s economy to have flat-lined in the July-September period and to grow by just 0.1% in the fourth quarter, with zero growth forecast for 2024 and an expansion of just 0.25% in 2025.
But even so, inflation would only return to 2% at end of 2025, roughly six months later than previously forecast.
ADVERTISEMENT
Investors think the BoE has reached the end of its run of rate hikes, given the risk of a recession.
In the run-up to Thursday’s announcement they were betting that the BoE will keep interest rates on hold until at least August next year when it would probably start to cut them.
ADVERTISEMENT
The BoE showed no sign that it was challenging those expectations: its forecasts on Thursday showed that, based on the market’s pricing for Bank Rate in the future, inflation would fall to its 2% target in two years’ time.
The slowdown in the economy and the fading impact of last year’s gas price surge is likely mean inflation resumes its fall soon. The BoE said it was likely to drop to 4.8% in October, almost two full points lower than in September.
But the BoE is still keeping a close eye on strong wage growth which it fears could keep a flame under inflation.
The central bank said there were “increasing uncertainties” about official data on the labour market, which has been hampered by low survey response rates, but jobs growth was likely to have been weaker than it previously thought and the worryingly strong growth in wages was expected to cool off.
The BoE forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 5% in two years’ time from around 4.2% now, based on the market’s path for interest rates.
One detail in the BoE’s otherwise downbeat assessment of the economy is likely to be welcomed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
It predicted inflation of 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 which would mean Sunak meets his pledge to voters to have price growth this year, ahead of a national election which is widely expected in 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/bank-of-england-rates-15-year-high-9010869/,business
Tata Motors posts fourth consecutive quarterly profit as JLR sales jump,Tata Motors posted a fourth consecutive quarterly profit on Thursday as higher sales of its luxury Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cars boost margins.,"Tata Motors posted a bigger-than-expected second-quarterly profit on Thursday, as higher sales of its luxury Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cars drove record revenue and boosted margins.
The automaker’s consolidated quarterly net profit, its fourth in a row, was 37.64 billion rupees ($452 million), beating analysts’ estimate of 43.52 billion rupees, per LSEG data.
It posted a 9.45 billion-rupees loss in the year-ago period.
Tata’s overall revenue jumped 32.1% to a record 1.05 trillion rupees, largely due to a 21% rise in retail sales of JLR models, including at its China joint venture.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sales of JLR’s three most profitable models – Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender – surged nearly 90%. They accounted for nearly 60% of overall sales, compared to 37% a year before.
Strong JLR sales are key to Tata’s earnings as the UK-based carmaker accounts for two-thirds of its parent’s revenue.
The rest is from the India business, where revenue from commercial vehicles rose 22.3%, although passenger vehicles revenue dropped 3%.
JLR’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin rose to 14.9%, from 10.3%.
ADVERTISEMENT
That pulled the company’s overall EBITDA margins up to 13.7%, from 9.7% earlier.
Tata raised its forecast for JLR’s full-year EBIT (earnings margin before interest and taxes) margin to around 8%, from 6%.

"Fed keeps rates unchanged, Powell hedges on possible end of tightening campaign","The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.","The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the situation remained something of a riddle, with U.S. central bank officials willing to raise rates again if progress on inflation stalls, wary that a rise in market-based interest rates may begin to weigh on the economy in a significant way, and trying not to disrupt, any more than necessary, an ongoing dynamic of steady job and wage growth.
In a press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting, Powell said the better course of action for now, given the uncertainties, was to maintain the Fed’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, and see how job and price data evolve between now and the next policy meeting in December.
ADVERTISEMENT
Roughly 20 months into the Fed’s aggressive tightening of monetary policy, Powell said it remained unclear whether overall financial conditions were yet restrictive enough to tame inflation that he still considers to be far above the central bank’s 2% target.
“We’re not confident that we haven’t, we’re not confident that we have” reached that sufficiently restrictive plateau, Powell told reporters. “Inflation has been coming down, but it’s still running well above our 2% target … A few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence.”
Annual inflation, based on the Fed’s preferred measure, was 3.4% in September for the third month in a row. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, it was 3.7%, little changed from August.
Asked if the Fed maintained a bias towards hiking rates versus keeping policy on hold, Powell responded “that’s the question we’re asking. Should we hike more?”
MARKET RATES IN FOCUS
ADVERTISEMENT
But the Fed chief also acknowledged that a recent market-driven rise in Treasury bond yields, home mortgage rates and other financing costs could have their own impact on the economy as long as they persist, and Fed officials will be watching those effects closely as they consider whether to hike the central bank’s policy rate again.
“These higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses. Those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists,” Powell said, taking particular note of 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages that are nearing 8%, close to a 25-year high.
Powell’s comments elaborated on a policy decision and statement that, while leaving the Fed’s benchmark rate unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, also took stock of what he called the “outsized” 4.9% annual pace of U.S. economic growth in the July-September period after a surge of consumer spending.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter,” the U.S. central bank said in its statement after policymakers unanimously agreed to leave rates unchanged. The language marked an upgrade to the “solid pace” of activity the Fed saw as of its September meeting.
U.S. stocks climbed after the release of the policy statement and closed higher on the day, while the U.S. dollar pared gains and ended flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and traders of short-term U.S. interest rates added to bets the Fed was done raising its policy rate and would start cutting rates by June of next year.
“The statement leans to the dovish side,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “The fact that they left rates unchanged for the second time in a row suggests the Fed might leave rates unchanged in December. And if they do, that means the Fed is done.”
Though markets think the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign may be finished, data pointing to a stronger-than-expected economy and labor market have kept the prospect of another hike on the table.
Powell noted that much about the economy’s recent performance was constructive, with low unemployment and rising wages fueling more demand for goods and services and more job creation – the sort of virtuous cycle that, within bounds, leads to self-sustaining growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
The issue for the Fed is whether conditions remain so robust that progress on inflation stalls or even reverses.
“It has been good,” Powell said. “We’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this … The question is, how long can that continue?”
ADVERTISEMENT
The odds, he said, are that a slowdown of some sort will be needed, with the Fed committed to finding the policy stance that makes it happen.
“It is still likely … we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market … to fully restore price stability,” Powell said.

Mumbai ranks 4th in global housing price rise,"Shishir Baijal, Chairman and MD, Knight Frank India said, “The robust price trend in the upper end of the market coupled with strong sales momentum has elevated Mumbai’s position in this global ranking scale.

The 6.5 per cent increase in prime residential prices has moved the city up by 18 places from 22nd rank in September 2022. New Delhi and Bengaluru too recorded an upward movement in their index rankings. NCR moved from 36th rank a year ago to 10th in September 2023 with a growth of 4.1 per cent YoY, Knight Frank said.

Bengaluru’s rank increased from 27 in 2022 to 17 in 2023 with a growth of 2.2 per cent.
The average rise in annual prime residential prices was recorded at 2.1 per cent across the 46 markets in the 12-month period ending September 2023. This is the strongest growth rate recorded since Q3 2022 and reflects 67 per cent of cities seeing growth on an annual basis, it said.

Manila claimed the top spot with a 21.2 per cent rise in prices. This is attributed to strong domestic and foreign investments. Dubai, with its 15.9 per cent annual growth, has been displaced from the top position for the first time in eight quarters due to a sharp decline in quarterly growth from 11.6 per cent in June quarter to 0.7 per cent in September quarter. San Francisco was the weakest market with a decline of 9.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

“The homebuyers’ increasing need to upgrade their lifestyle, coupled with stable economic prospects of the country and improving market sentiments should sustain price growth in the short to medium term,” he said.
Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s Global Head of Research, said: “The improvement in average annual house price growth will be welcomed by prime market homeowners but shouldn’t be overstated. Higher rates mean we have moved into a world of lower asset price growth – and investors will need to work harder to identify opportunities for outperformance to secure target returns.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/mumbai-ranks-4th-in-global-housing-price-rise-9009705/,business

"Airtel Q2 profit falls 37.5% to Rs 1,341 crore on one-time exceptional charge","Airtel said homes business maintains its rapid growth trajectory and delivered a revenue growth of 23.3 per cent year-on-year, result of the company's strategy to harness the growing demand of high-speed and reliable broadband in India.","India’s second largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Tuesday reported 37.5 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,341 crore for September 2023 quarter, weighed down by one-time exceptional charge.
Bharti Airtel — which competes in the market with Reliance Jio as also Vodafone Idea — saw its Q2FY24 total revenue climb 7.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 37,044 crore “backed by strong and consistent performance in India operations”.
Net income (after exceptional items) at about Rs 1,341 crore, was 37.5 per cent lower than the year-ago period. Net income (before exceptional items) stood at nearly Rs 2,960 crore.

“After accounting for loss of Rs 16,190 million towards exceptional items (net of tax and non-controlling interests) …the resultant net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 came in at Rs 13,407 million, compared to a profit of Rs 21,452 million in the corresponding quarter last year and profit of Rs 16,125 million in the previous quarter,” Bharti Airtel said in its quarterly report on Q2 earnings.
India business posted quarterly revenues of Rs 26,995 crore, which was up 10.9 per cent year-on-year. Mobile services India revenues rose 11 per cent year-on-year, led by strong 4G/5G customer additions and increase in ARPU, the telco said.
Airtel Business revenue was up 9.5 per cent YoY, backed by synergies from connectivity solutions.
Mobile ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) increased to Rs 203 in Q2’24 against Rs 190 in Q2’23, buoyed by “sustained focus on acquiring high value customers and improved realisations”.

“We continue to deliver industry leading ARPU along with growing average data usage per data customer at 21.7 GBs/month,” the company said in a release.
Mobile data consumption was up 19.6 per cent on-year with consumption per customer pegged at 21.7 GB per month.
“This has been yet another quarter of solid revenue growth and improved margins. Our India revenue continues to gain momentum and grew sequentially by 2.4 per cent. Our consolidated revenue, however, was impacted by the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira,” managing director Gopal Vittal said.

The company recorded 7.7 million 4G/5G net subscribers addition and exited the quarter with an “industry-leading ARPU of 203”, he added.
“Our postpaid and homes businesses continued their strong growth trajectory as we added the highest ever net adds in both these segments in any single quarter. Our performance is underpinned by a simple and consistent strategy of focusing on quality customers and delivering the best experience to them in a seamless digital way,” Vittal further said.
According to Airtel, the postpaid segment saw highest ever net adds of 1 million in Q2’24 thereby reaching a customer base of 43.9 million (including IoT).
“We continue to garner strong market share of 4G/5G customers and added 27.2 million 4G/5G data customers to our network over last year, an increase of 12.9 per cent year-on-year,” it said.
Airtel said homes business maintains its rapid growth trajectory and delivered a revenue growth of 23.3 per cent year-on-year, result of the company’s strategy to harness the growing demand of high-speed and reliable broadband in India.

Explaining the one-time charge, Airtel said on October 16, 2023, the Supreme Court pronounced a judgement on tax treatment of adjusted revenue linked Variable Licence Fee (VLF) payable to the telecom department since July 1999 and held that it is capital in nature and not revenue expenditure for the purpose of computation of taxable income.
While the decision does not per se alter the total amount of VLF allowed as deduction over the licence period, it creates a timing difference wherein later years would have a higher deduction.

“This has resulted in an additional tax provision of Rs 2,263 million primarily due to change in effective tax rate on account of adoption of new tax regime. The interest charge of Rs 13,500 million on the above matter has been presented as an exceptional item,” Airtel said in its quarterly report.
Additionally, exceptional item includes a charge of Rs 220.3 crore on account of re-assessment of regulatory levies. “The tax credit on above re-assessment amounting to Rs 554 million is included under the tax expense / (credit). The net share of loss allocated to non-controlling interests on the above exceptional items is Rs 1,221 million,” Airtel said.

The purchasing managers’ index, or PMI, fell to 49.5 in October on a 100-point scale, down from 50.2 last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity while a number above 50 reflects an expansion. The non-manufacturing PMI for October fell 1.1 percentage points to 50.6, a sign of slowing activity in China’s service and construction industries.

Factory output and supplier delivery times improved while measures of new orders, raw materials and employment contracted.
China’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has faltered after an initial burst of growth earlier in the year faded more quickly than expected.
In recent months, the government has raised spending on building ports and other infrastructure, cut interest rates and eased curbs on home-buying. But economists say wider reforms are needed to address long-term problems that are stifling growth.
“If reflected in hard activity data, today’s PMIs suggest that the momentum of China’s economic growth ebbed at the beginning of the fourth quarter,” Robert Carnell, regional head of research for ING Economics in Asia Pacific, said in a report.

Carnell said support measures, including increased government spending, will help offset any tendency for the economy to slow.
“Even so, today’s data suggest that although it has weakened, economic growth is still ongoing,” he said.
Recent data suggest China will likely to hit its growth target of 5% for the year, he said. The economy expanded at a 4.9% annual pace in the last quarter.

The net profit — which came on the back of a boost in refining and marketing margin — compared to a loss of Rs 272.35 crore in July-September 2022, according to a stock exchange filing by the company.
Besides robust refining margins, the profit was aided by a boost in marketing margins as a freeze on petrol and diesel price revision despite a fall in input crude oil prices helped recover losses incurred when rates were high last year.

Pre-tax earnings from the sale of petroleum products soared to Rs 17,755.95 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal compared to Rs 104.04 crore in the same period last year.
Last year, state-owned fuel retailers IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) froze prices despite a spike in global oil prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was with a view to insulate consumers from price volatility.
The price freeze led to the three firms incurring losses in the first half of the 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023). IOC incurred a loss of Rs 2,264.88 crore in April-September 2022. This year, it, however, posted record earnings of Rs 26,717.76 crore in April-September 2023, more than the Rs 24,184 crore record net profit the company had posted in 2021-22.

"Chief executives of Air India, Akasa joust over poaching of pilots","The chief executives of Air India and Akasa Air have privately exchanged barbs over the poaching of pilots, with the latter accusing its bigger rival of rule violations, provoking a reply that collusion to curb job switching can breach competition law.","The chief executives of Air India and Akasa Air have privately exchanged barbs over the poaching of pilots, with the latter accusing its bigger rival of rule violations, provoking a reply that collusion to curb job switching can breach competition law.
The exchange, detailed in a Sept. 21 letter seen by Reuters, spotlights growing competition in India’s aviation market, as a strong rebound in air travel after the pandemic, coupled with a flurry of orders for new aircraft, lead to a shortage of pilots.
The rare verbal and written confrontations between the airlines’ chief executives were detailed in the letter, sent by Campbell Wilson of Air India, which is owned by the Tata Group conglomerate, to Vinay Dube of low-cost airline Akasa.
ADVERTISEMENT
It followed a telephone call between them and a missive Dube had sent expressing his concerns to the Tata Group.
The Sept. 21 letter shows Air India pushed back after Akasa accused it of contravening government policies that mandate a notice period of six to 12 months for pilots, rules that Indian pilots’ groups are challenging in court.
Wilson told his counterpart the government rules were “not currently enforceable”, adding that Akasa itself had “previously engaged in the same actions” by poaching pilots from Tata Group’s budget carrier, Air India Express, and other airlines.
“It was a little surprising to us that Akasa now found the practice objectionable,” Wilson wrote in the letter, which Reuters is reporting for the first time.
ADVERTISEMENT
Akasa did not comment on its communication with Air India, but said the issue of pilot exits was “now behind us … we are squarely back in growth mode”.
Air India declined to comment and the two chief executives did not respond to requests for comment.
The dispute comes at the time of a hiring spree by Air India, with its arm, Air India Express, seeking to more than triple its fleet to 170 over five years.
ADVERTISEMENT
In recent weeks, Akasa has lost about a tenth of its 450 pilots, who left without serving out notice periods, some to join Air India Express.
In September, Akasa said it feared a shutdown and sued some pilots, as well as the aviation watchdog, for not coming to its aid, in lawsuits still pending in the courts.
In his letter, Wilson added that he had “cautioned” Dube during their telephone call that asking a competitor to collude in curbing employees’ rights to switch employers “could be construed as potentially a contravention of competition law”.
“I regret that you interpreted my courtesy of taking your call and listening to your request as assent,” he added.
The Federation of Indian Pilots has described the alleged mass resignations from Akasa as an “indication” of employee discontent, while India’s aviation watchdog has said it cannot interfere in matters related to employment contracts.
ADVERTISEMENT
India’s newest airline, Akasa started flying in 2022, garnering a market share of 4%. It competes with IndiGo , which commands a share of 60% and Tata Group’s airlines that together have a share of 25.7%.
In the Sept. 21 letter, Air India’s Wilson expressed the hope that Akasa would make investments to “attract, retain and develop” its own staff, adding that his airline looked forward to “continuing healthy competition”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/air-india-akasa-chief-executives-joust-over-pilots-poaching-9007255/,business

The Fed is widely expected to hold rates at its policy decision after the bell on Wednesday. But Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary will be key.

Gold demand loses lustre in peak festive season as prices rally,"Gold prices near record highs could dampen demand in India during the peak festival season and lead to the lowest purchase volumes in three years, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Tuesday.","Gold prices near record highs could dampen demand in India during the peak festival season and lead to the lowest purchase volumes in three years, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Tuesday.
India is the world’s second-largest gold consumer, and a drop in purchases could limit a rally in global prices. Falling demand for gold imports could also help narrow India’s trade deficit and support the rupee.
Higher prices in the December quarter, which traditionally sees the highest sales of the year, could cut back purchases, said Somasundaram PR, regional chief executive officer of WGC’s Indian operations.

Gold demand in India usually strengthens towards the end of the year, which coincides with the traditional wedding season and major festivals including Diwali and Dusherra, when bullion buying is considered auspicious.
Local gold prices jumped this week to 61,396 rupees per 10 grams, near the all-time high of 61,845 rupees hit earlier this year. Last year, prices in the December quarter were nearly 20% lower than this year.
In the December quarter, demand is expected to be lower than last year’s 276.3 metric tons, Somasundaram said.
“Currently, price is a significant influencer. If there is a substantial drop in price closer to Diwali, the entire situation could change,” he said. Diwali will be celebrated in mid-November.

Indian gold consumption in the July-September quarter rose 10% to 210.2 metric tons, as both jewellery and investment demand improved due to a correction in local prices, he said.

In 2023, demand could fall to around 700 metric tons, the lowest in three years, down from 774.1 metric tons a year ago, he said.

Use Your Credit Score to Achieve Your Financial Goals in India,"Your financial goals, whether it's buying a home, starting a business, or pursuing higher education, often rely on your ability to secure loans and credit. In India, your creditworthiness is evaluated primarily through your credit score. ","Your financial goals, whether it’s buying a home, starting a business, or pursuing higher education, often rely on your ability to secure loans and credit. In India, your creditworthiness is evaluated primarily through your credit score. 
This three-digit number holds the key to unlocking financial opportunities and achieving your dreams. Read on to learn how you can use your credit score to achieve your financial goals.
Understanding Your Credit Score 
Your credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness. In India, credit bureaus like CIBIL, Experian, and Equifax calculate credit scores based on various factors. Your credit score typically ranges from 300 to 900, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.
ADVERTISEMENT
Here’s how your credit score is generally categorised in India:
Credit Score Meaning 
Above 800 Excellent
740 to 799 Very Good
670 to 739  Good
580 to 669  Fair
300 to 579 Poor
Disclaimer: This is a generic table. Depending on the credit bureau you choose or prefer, the ratings and their meanings may differ. 
Ways to Leverage Credit Score to Achieve Financial Goals 
Secure Low-Interest Loans
A high credit score often translates to lower interest rates on loans, including personal loans, home loans, and car loans. Lenders view individuals with excellent credit scores as low-risk borrowers, making them eligible for the best interest rates available in the market. With a good CIBIL rating, you can get a loan at low interest rates.
By maintaining a good credit score, you can save a significant amount of money on interest payments over the tenure of a loan.
ADVERTISEMENT
Faster Loan Approvals
A strong credit score can expedite the loan approval process. Lenders are more likely to approve loans quickly for borrowers with high credit scores because they have a proven track record of responsible financial behaviour. 
This can be particularly advantageous when you need funds urgently to seize an investment opportunity or address an unexpected financial need.
Higher Credit Limits
With a good credit score, credit card issuers are more likely to offer you higher credit limits. This can be helpful for managing your monthly expenses and emergencies while maintaining a low credit utilisation ratio, which is essential for a healthy credit score.
ADVERTISEMENT
Negotiate Better Terms
A high credit score gives you leverage when negotiating terms with lenders. Whether you’re securing a mortgage or negotiating the interest rate on a personal loan, lenders are more likely to accommodate your requests when you have a strong credit history.
Improve Your Homeownership Prospects
A good credit score can help you qualify for a mortgage with favourable terms, such as a lower down payment or reduced interest rates. Additionally, it can increase your chances of being approved for rental agreements, making the transition to homeownership smoother.
Start a Business
Entrepreneurs looking to start or expand a business often require financing. A solid credit score can open doors to business loans and credit lines, providing the capital needed to launch or grow your venture. It’s a valuable asset for aspiring business owners seeking to turn their dreams into reality.
Achieve Education Goals
Pursuing higher education can be expensive, but your credit score can help you secure education loans with reasonable interest rates. Whether you’re investing in your own education or planning for your child’s future, a strong credit profile can ease the financial burden of educational expenses.
Consolidate Debt
If you have multiple high-interest debts, such as credit card balances or personal loans, a good credit score can enable you to consolidate your debt into a single, lower-interest loan. Debt consolidation can simplify your finances, reduce your monthly payments, and help you pay off debt more efficiently.
ADVERTISEMENT
Plan for Retirement
Your credit score can indirectly impact your retirement planning. A strong credit profile can lead to better financial stability, allowing you to save and invest more effectively for your retirement years. It can also result in lower living expenses if you’ve successfully managed your debt throughout your working life.
Maintaining and Improving Your Credit Score
While your credit score can open doors to financial opportunities, it’s essential to maintain and improve it continually. Here are some strategies to help you achieve and maintain a high credit score:
ADVERTISEMENT
Timely Bill Payments: Paying dues on time, like credit card bills or loan EMIs, is crucial as late payments could significantly harm your credit score.
Low Credit Utilisation: Keeping your credit card balances low relative to your credit limit is important since a high credit utilisation ratio could lower your score.
Avoid Taking New Credit: Don’t take on more debt than you can comfortably manage as high levels of debt can negatively impact your creditworthiness.
Credit Report Discrepancies: Regularly check your credit report for errors and report any inaccuracies to the credit bureau for correction.
Responsible Credit Usage: Be cautious when opening new credit accounts since frequent credit inquiries or multiple new accounts in a short period can lower your score.
Conclusion
By understanding how your credit score works and consistently practising responsible financial habits, you can leverage your creditworthiness to access loans, secure favourable interest rates, and accomplish your dreams. Remember that building and maintaining a good credit score is a long-term commitment, but the rewards, in terms of financial flexibility and opportunities, are well worth the effort.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sponsored-business/use-your-credit-score-to-achieve-your-financial-goals-in-india-9006096/,business
Sri Lankan government renews Lanka IOC’s petroleum licence for 20 years,"The licence originally issued in 2003 was to expire in January 2024. This will allow Lanka IOC to continue its retail operations on the debt-trapped island nation until January 22, 2044.","The Sri Lankan government has renewed the petroleum products licence granted to Lanka IOC, the local subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation, for another 20 years, officials said on Monday.
The licence originally issued in 2003 was to expire in January 2024. This will allow Lanka IOC to continue its retail operations on the debt-trapped island nation until January 22, 2044.
The licence renewal letter was handed over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to Dipak Das the Managing Director of LIOC late last week, Aseem Bhargav, the Chief Financial Officer of LIOC said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government has renewed the petroleum products licence granted to Lanka IOC, the local subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation, for another 20 years, the LIOC officials told PTI on Monday.
“The licence enables LIOC to import, export, store, transport, distribute, sell and supply petrol diesel, heavy diesel, furnace oil, kerosene, Naphtha and other mineral petroleum including premium petrol and premium diesel.” The LIOC holds around 20 per cent of the market share in the auto fuel segment in Sri Lanka.
When Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis with no forex to import petroleum products, the LIOC operation became crucial in the energy sector. It operates over 200 retail outlets throughout the island nation.
Since the economic crisis came to bite Sri Lanka, it liberalised the energy sector. China’s Sinopec entered in August as the third player in the retail fuel trade while USA’s RM Parks and Australia’s United Petroleum are also due to commence operations soon.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, the main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) on Sunday expressed its strong opposition to the Government’s decision to extend Lanka IOC’s petroleum licence.
Speaking at a press conference held at the opposition leader’s office in Colombo, SJB Deputy General Secretary Mujibur Rahman raised questions regarding the basis on which the licence renewal was granted by the Government.
Rahman pointed out that the agreement with Lanka IOC was originally established in 2001, granting the entity hefty tax concessions and a 20-year licence to operate in Sri Lanka in exchange for a USD 70 million investment.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The agreement was struck without a competitive tender process and lacked transparency,” he was quoted as saying by the Daily Financial Times newspaper.
“Once again, there was no competitive tender process or transparency. Are we obligated to grant this deal to the IOC? Was this agreement secretly negotiated between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Narendra Modi?” he asked.
Rahman pointed out that IOC was unable to address the fuel shortages during Sri Lanka’s most severe crisis or provide better prices to the public.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/sri-lankan-government-renews-lanka-ioc-petroleum-licence-20-years-9005840/,business
"Finance Minister calls for inter-govt cooperation to curb smuggling, catch masterminds",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was speaking at the Global Conference on Cooperation in Enforcement Matters organised by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Monday called for intergovernmental cooperation to curb smuggling so that the “brain” behind such activities get caught instead of smaller fry. She also said antiques from museums across the world should be returned to their respective countries.
Sitharaman said technology and “actionable information” are important tools in curbing smuggling. “It is important for all governments to know how to deter smuggling activities which are endangering our wild flora and fauna. How to deter activities where networked groups think that small fry can be sacrificed, police or customs authorities can catch hold of this small and larger fish, which is the brain behind, is never going to be caught,” she said at the Global Conference on Cooperation in Enforcement Matters organised by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).
Sitharaman said the nature of smuggled or illegally traded goods has not changed over the last 50-60 years — it continues to be precious metals, narcotics, and precious reserves from forest or marine life. “I place a lot of emphasis on intergovernmental cooperation, along with WCO (World Customs Organisation), so that we are able to crack the brains behind it (smuggling), the masterminds behind it, with the help from local authorities and governments,” she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Deterrence of illicit trade will be strengthened if all confiscated goods are destroyed and not put into the market, she said. “It is also periodically our duty to restore confidence in the minds of citizens saying such activities will be punished, will be curbed, and will be deterred. So if only gold, cigarettes, narcotics, antiques and wildlife materials are being smuggled, it is your experience which will have to show us the direction and the path forward so that we are able to contain this evil because it hurts all our economies,” Sitharaman said.
The minister noted the importance of technology in curbing smuggling saying enforcement agencies are at an advantageous position as they are armed with technology. “Technology should go hand in hand with information sharing. And when you share information, it should be actionable,” the minister said.
The minister also said that antiques that are stolen and smuggled should be returned to their home countries. “India has lost a lot of them (precious antiques). We see them all over the world when we go to museums across the world. We need all of them to come back to their respective (countries), so should the Egyptians, the Romans be feeling about their antiques that they have lost. So all the ancient civilizations have lost a lot of their antiques and they should rightfully be back in their respective countries,” she said.
Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra at the same event said
smuggling is a multidimensional issue with a detrimental impact on the economy of a country and national security, thus, making it crucial to have coordination among different agencies and countries “Use of highly sophisticated networks and advanced technology by the criminals make detection of these trans-national crimes extremely difficult. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to counter such cross-border crimes is to improve cooperation and coordination among different agencies and countries. This can involve sharing intelligence, increasing communication, and implementing joint operations to identify and intercept smuggled goods,” he said.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) chief Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said as global trade continues to interconnect and economies flourish, there is a corresponding rise in the potential for unlawful movement of restricted items like antiques, cigarettes, gold and endangered wildlife species, amongst others. “The undercurrent of illegal trade in narcotics remains strong. Global drug trafficking is estimated to be worth $650 billion, contributing 30 per cent of the overall illicit economy. It is having a devastating impact…,” he said, adding the crimes involving illicit trade many a time have possible linkages with money laundering and terror financing, which impact national security.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/intergovernmental-coop-crack-masterminds-behind-smuggling-network-nirmala-sitharaman-9005645/,business

"Tata-Wistron deal will build on contract mfg base built by Dixon, VVDN, Optiemus","While India touts itself as the world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer, it has a long way to go. It is still early days for India’s contract manufacturing journey, with the country having a small stake in the electronics components supply chains.","With the deal between the Tatas and Wistron awaiting regulatory clearance — a formality at this stage — the salt-to-software conglomerate is set to become the first domestic company to assemble Apple iPhones, marking a significant moment in the beginning of the rise of India’s contract manufacturing.
There are a few key factors that have given an impetus to contract manufacturing in India, propelling a number of other domestic companies aside from the Tatas to kickstart domestic production. These include the government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphone production, a worsening relationship between the US and China which has forced companies to diversify and Beijing’s tough Covid-19 curbs.
While India touts itself as the world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer, it has a long way to go. It is still early days for India’s contract manufacturing journey, with the country having a small stake in the electronics components supply chains.
ADVERTISEMENT
Contract manufacturing is when a company outsources production to a third-party. The industry has been the bedrock of China’s economic success over the last two-three decades.
Taking iPhones as an example, a Bloomberg study from last year estimated that it would take about eight years to move just 10 per cent of Apple’s production capacity out of China, where more than 90 per cent of the company’s iPhones are made.
But even then, from a nearly dormant manufacturing sector up until a few years ago, there has been a surge in other Indian companies assembling phones and other electronics for global giants. These include Haryana-based VVDN Technologies which recently bagged a contract to manufacture high-end servers for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Noida-based Dixon Technologies which announced it will manufacture smartphones for Xiaomi, marking its entry into large-scale mass manufacturing of mobile phones. In the last six months, Dixon’s stock price has increased by over 84 per cent.
Contract manufacturing in ancillary industries too is taking shape. Display glass maker Corning recently said it will begin display glass finishing in India by next year with an initial capacity of 30 million pieces as part of a joint venture with Optiemus Infracom. The company already makes phones for LG, Blackberry, HTC, Oppo, and OnePlus. Both Dixon and Optiemus are beneficiaries under the smartphone PLI scheme.
ADVERTISEMENT
Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar told The Indian Express that while building iPhones and other gadgets in India is important, the real value is created by the contract manufacturers who produce those devices. “They set up the plant, employ people, contribute to the economy and will ultimately help us in achieving the scale which will attract other suppliers to India as well,” he said.
“As the contract manufacturers scale up for volumes, the components that go into those products will naturally start attracting suppliers to India, who could set up ancillary factories in the country,” Chandrasekhar said.
Amid US-China tensions, India is potentially the only country which provides a big internal market and a massive, educated labour force to produce devices for export. But, experts say there are a few concerns that investors, and especially supply chain entities could have about entering India.

First, India has among the world’s highest import tariffs on some electronics components — something a number of domestic firms had lobbied for to discourage Chinese imports. But with more Indian companies now setting up manufacturing facilities, they will face the heat of the high tariff rates. According to a recent study by industry body India Cellular & Electronics Association, India’s MFN tariff average for a number of electronic components is 9.7 per cent, compared to an average of 3.2 per cent in China.
The IT Ministry has recommended to the Finance Ministry to lower input costs on some components, but a formal decision is yet to be taken.
Then, there is India’s complicated relationship with China. Because of  India’s actions against Chinese firms, experts say there is little hope Chinese suppliers will come to India easily, making the journey to set up a domestic supplier base much longer, since technology is neither easy to build nor cheap.
“Take Tatas’ example. They have opted to buy an operational plant put together by Wistron, since building a facility from scratch would have been a tall order for the conglomerate which has very little experience of participating in global supply chains,” an industry executive said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/tata-wistron-deal-will-build-on-contract-mfg-base-built-by-dixon-vvdn-optiemus-9003862/,business
"PM calls for greater self-reliance in cybersecurity hardware, software",The prime minister also said that India should establish itself as a thought leader as a natural progression from being an adopter and implementer of technology.,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for India to become self-reliant in cybersecurity across hardware and software, highlighting that having a control over the value chain will ensure security of the country’s digital infrastructure.
“For cybersecurity, self reliance is very important in the entire manufacturing value chain — be it hardware, software or connectivity. When everything in the value chain is under our national domain, it will help us in keeping them secure,” Modi said on Friday at the seventh edition of the India Mobile Congress.

After a quarter of weaknesses in the oil-to-chemicals business, strong fuel and petrochemical demand and a cut in windfall profit tax on exports helped a rebound in revenues of the company’s core business.
The firm helmed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani saw retail business getting good traction with growth in fashion and lifestyle as well as grocery and consumer electronics. Telecom revenues posted a modest increase as the company has not yet announced a tariff plan for 5G services even though there was a jump in data consumption with consumers migrating from faster networks.
Its revenue was almost flat at Rs 2.55 lakh crore. Finance cost rose 26 per cent to Rs 5,731 crore due to higher interest rates and loan balance.
Depreciation/amortisation expenses were up 30 per cent to Rs 12,585 crore due to an expanded asset base across all businesses and higher network utilisation in the digital services business. This is the second straight quarter of a rise in finance costs and depreciation.

Operationally, the company posted a 30 per cent growth in EBITDA or earnings before tax at Rs 44,867 crore.
The mainstay oil refining and petrochemicals business, called O2C, posted a 36 per cent jump in EBITDA to Rs 16,281 crore on “strength in gasoline and PVC margins, optimised feedstock sourcing and lower special additional excise duty (SAED or windfall profit tax) in line with the decline in middle-distillate cracks,” the statement said, adding exports fell 3 per cent.
With the consumer base swelling to 459.7 million from 448.5 million at the end of June and per-user revenues rising to Rs 181.7 from Rs 180.5, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd – the digital services business – posted a 12 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 5,297 crore in Q2. Also aiding the business was consumers migrating to its latest offering 5G services.

Profits from the retail business climbed 21 per cent to Rs 2,790 crore as store count rose to 18,650 from 18,446. Oil and gas EBITDA soared 50 per cent to Rs 4,766 crore as the price for gas produced from the KG-D6 block rose.
“With incremental gas production from MJ field, along with ongoing production from R Cluster and Satellite Cluster fields, Block KG D6 is currently producing around 29 million standard cubic meters per day” as compared to 27 mmscmd in the preceding quarter,” it said.
The company said its outstanding debt declined to Rs 2.95 lakh crore from Rs 3.18 lakh crore at June end.
Commenting on the results, Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, of Reliance Industries Limited said: “Strong operational and financial contribution from all business segments has helped Reliance deliver another quarter of robust growth”.
Jio, he said, remains committed to the vision of a digital India through the launch of two innovative and transformative offerings, JioAirFiber and JioBharat phone.

JioBharat phone will enable digital inclusion for millions of Indians and catalyse India’s transformation to next-gen connectivity solutions.” Ambani reiterated that by December 2023, Reliance will also complete the pan-India rollout of 5G services, setting “a new global benchmark for the fastest roll-out of a 5G network across a large nation”.
Ambani said Reliance Retail continued to rapidly expand its offline and online presence while adding to its already impressive range of products and offerings.

“We are providing a fresh and friendly shopping experience across our seamless ecosystem. The strength and diversity of our retail business model is consistently delivering robust performance.” The resilient performance of the O2C segment, despite volatility in energy markets, was led by strong growth in fuel demand in a supply-constrained market, he said.
“Weak global demand and supply overhang continued to impact downstream margins. The growth of oil and gas business is particularly noteworthy with production from KG D6 block ramping up and providing valuable fuel for the energy transition to the Indian economy.” The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 38,815 crore, with continuing accelerated investments in the pan-India 5G rollout.

"VIL will make significant investments to roll out 5G network, expand 4G coverage: Birla","At IMC, the largest industry showcase of India's telecom prowess, Birla said: ""India's digital ecosystem stands on the brink of unprecedented growth.""","Telecom operator Vodafone Idea (VIL) will make significant investments to roll out 5G network and expand 4G coverage in the coming quarters, billionaire industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla promised on Friday. His statement also underlined the troubled telco’s resolve to strengthen service capability and offerings with fifth-generation services.
Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, which is one of the shareholders of the crisis-ridden VIL, was speaking at the inaugural session of the India Mobile Congress (IMC). “In the coming quarters, Vodafone Idea will initiate significant investments in order to roll out 5G networks and further expand 4G coverage across the country. Moreover, the company is determined to realise the government’s vision of establishing a robust supply chain in critical and emerging areas, including Open RAN (Radio Access Network),” he said.
Further, Birla said this endeavour will enable innovative Indian companies to design both hardware and software for the global markets. The comment assumes significance as VIL has been battling financial woes and subscriber losses, as rivals Jio and Bharti Airtel cement their position in the highly competitive telecom market with 5G services.
ADVERTISEMENT
At IMC, the largest industry showcase of India’s telecom prowess, Birla said: “India’s digital ecosystem stands on the brink of unprecedented growth.” India’s digital revolution is gaining global prominence as a benchmark for promoting both digital transformation and inclusive growth. “India has really emerged as a champion for the global south inspired by Prime Minister’s vision,” Birla said, noting that many countries in the global south are now eager to adopt India’s “pathbreaking” digital public infrastructure assets across identity, payments and data management.
Vodafone Idea, he said, is committed to being a responsible partner in achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision. “Over the past year, the Vodafone Idea team has worked diligently to prepare the core network for the 5G deployment,” Birla said.
The company’s management has focused on creating customer value for over 220 million citizens and thousands of enterprises by providing superior data and network experience as well as building a differentiated digital experience. “VIL has successfully developed a range of advanced use cases poised to make a tangible difference across crucial sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, automotive, logistics, and many others,” he said. This encompasses the entire value chain of enterprises, as well as MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) which he termed as “engines for growth and employment” contributing significantly to India’s progress.
The telco (Vodafone Idea) on Thursday reported a widening of its consolidated net loss at Rs 8,737.9 crore in the second quarter that ended September 30. The company had posted a net loss of Rs 7,595.5 crore a year ago. Vodafone has made a provision of Rs 822 crore for tax liability arising out of a Supreme Court judgement on October 16 to treat the revenue share license fee as a capital expense. VIL has incurred a loss of Rs 16,566.7 crore for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Its net worth at the end of the reported quarter stands at negative Rs 90,411.1 crore.

As of September 30, 2023, the total external debt of the company stood at Rs 2,12,784.6 crore. The total debt on VIL includes deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,35,130 crore and AGR (adjusted gross revenue) liability of Rs 68,180 crore that are due to the government, debt from banks and financial institutions worth Rs 7,860 crore and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1,610 crore.
“The company has exchanged correspondences and continues to be in discussion with the lenders for the next steps/waivers. The existing debt as payable by September 30, 2024, is Rs 7,174 crore,” VIL said in a recent filing.
VIL leadership has made several attempts to raise funds, but apart from a minor infusion of capital from promoters and relief from the government by way of converting dues of around Rs 16,333 crore into 33.44 per cent equity, there has been no other success for the company.

According to the filing, the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional funds as required, successful negotiations with lenders and vendors for continued support and the generation of cash flow from operations that it needs to settle its liabilities as they fall due.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/vil-investments-5g-network-expand-4g-coverage-birla-9002512/,business

Nayara Energy exports drop 22% as domestic consumption rises,"Nayara Energy, which operates a 20 million tonne a year oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, exported 4.57 million tonne of petroleum products including jet fuel, gasoil (diesel) and gasoline (petrol) between January-September 2023.","Nayara Energy, India’s largest private fuel retailer, on Friday said its petroleum product exports dropped by 22 per cent in the first nine months of 2023 as domestic consumption rose.
Nayara, which operates a 20 million tonne a year oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and a network of over 6,450 petrol pumps, exported 4.57 million tonne of petroleum products including jet fuel, gasoil (diesel) and gasoline (petrol) between January-September 2023 as compared to 5.88 million tonne in January-September 2022, the firm said in a statement.
This was primarily because of larger consumption at home. The company is catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain.
ADVERTISEMENT
Natural exports markets are in the Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia – the markets which have a consistent appetite for Nayara’s products throughout the year.
Commercially, it is unviable to cater to the seasonal requirements of EU markets (winter grade diesel). “Nayara’s diesel does not meet the winter specification requirements of the EU market, we see no commercial opportunity in this market,” it said.
Domestic sales made up for 69 per cent of the volumes during January-September 2023 and exports the remaining 31 per cent.
Out of the total 4.57 million tonne exports, diesel shipments stood at about 2.44 million tonne which is roughly 53 per cent of all exports for the same period.

The company said geographical proximity governs its exports markets. “Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East continue to remain the company’s primary export markets contributing to about 82 per cent of the total exports of petroleum products.” Between January-September 2023, Nayara supplied no gasoil and gasoline to Europe.
“Our primary focus for gasoline remains ensuring consistent supply to domestic markets through our retail outlets, and oil companies,” Nayara said adding gasoline export sales were flat at 0.9 million tonne in January-September 2023 when compared with the year-ago period.
Gasoil percentage export sales in the European Union has been less than 3 per cent of total gasoil exports during the last 5 years, it said adding Nayara supplied no diesel to Europe this year.

Also, “no gasoline has been exported to Europe,” it said.
The company is primarily focused on catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain.
India structurally, is long on diesel and the surplus is to be exported after satisfying domestic demand.
Nayara is the fastest growing private retail network with the addition of around 500 retail outlets every year. Nayara network is fully automated (98 per cent of outlets) for enhanced controls and standards.
Prasad Panicker, Chairman and Head of Refinery, Nayara Energy, said, “As an Indian company, Nayara is in India and for India. We are highly committed and driven to fuel the nation’s growing demand for energy. As a major downstream player, delivering about 8 per cent of India’s refining output, Nayara Energy is contributing significantly towards India’s energy security.” “We believe in being a strong partner to India’s energy needs and will continue to serve the country’s consumption demands.

"Vodafone Idea Q2 net loss widens to Rs 8,738 crore","""The company has exchanged correspondences and continues to be in discussion with the lenders for the next steps/waivers. The existing debt as payable by September 30, 2024, is Rs 7,174 crore,"" the filing said.","Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea on Thursday said its consolidated net loss widened to Rs 8,737.9 crore in the second quarter ended September 30.
The company had posted a net loss of Rs 7,595.5 crore a year ago.
Vodafone Idea (VIL) has made a provisioning of Rs 822 crore for tax liability arising out of a Supreme Court judgement on October 16 to treat revenue share license fee as capital expense.
ADVERTISEMENT
VIL has incurred a loss of Rs 16,566.7 crore for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Its net worth at the end of the reported quarter stands at negative Rs 90,411.1 crore.
“The net working capital (excluding short-term borrowings, future lease liability and certain accruals toward pending litigations) stands at negative Rs 17,538.6 crore,” VIL said in the filing.
Its consolidated revenue from operations was almost flat at Rs 10,716.3 crore during the reported quarter against Rs 10,655.5 crore in the September 2022 quarter.
The average revenue per user (ARPU), a key growth matrix of telecom operators, grew 2.1 per cent to 142 in the September 2023 quarter from Rs 139 in the previous quarter.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We are pleased to report another quarter of consecutive revenue growth, improvement in ARPU and 4G subscriber additions,” VIL CEO Akshaya Moondra said in a statement.
VIL’s overall subscriber base declined by about 6 per cent to 21.98 crore from 23.44 crore a year ago.
However, the 4G subscriber base of the company grew to 12.47 crore during the reported quarter from about 12 crore in the year-ago period.

The average data usage per 4G subscriber increased marginally to 15.8 GB during the September quarter from 15 GB in the same period a year earlier.
“We remain focused on our execution to effectively compete in the market. We remain engaged with our lenders for further debt fundraising as well as with other parties for equity and equity-linked fundraising, to make required investments for network expansion, including 5G rollout,” Moondra said.
As of September 30, 2023, the total external debt of the company stood at Rs 2,12,784.6 crore.
The total debt on VIL includes deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,35,130 crore and AGR (adjusted gross revenue) liability of Rs 68,180 crore that are due to the government, debt from banks and financial institutions worth Rs 7,860 crore and optionally convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1,610 crore.
“The company has exchanged correspondences and continues to be in discussion with the lenders for the next steps/waivers. The existing debt as payable by September 30, 2024, is Rs 7,174 crore,” the filing said.

VIL leadership has made several attempts to raise funds, but apart from a minor infusion of capital from promoters and relief from the government by way of converting dues of around Rs 16,333 into 33.44 per cent equity, there has been no other success for the company.
According to the filing, the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional funds as required, successful negotiations with lenders and vendors for continued support and the generation of cash flow from operations that it needs to settle its liabilities as they fall due.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/vodafone-idea-q2-net-loss-widens-to-rs-8738-crore-9001118/,business
"ECB keeps rates on hold, rejects talk of future cuts",ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference the euro zone economy was weak but stressed that price pressures remained strong and could be aggravated further if the Middle East conflict pushed energy costs higher.,"The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged as expected on Thursday, snapping an unprecedented streak of 10 consecutive rate hikes while insisting that any talk of rate cuts was premature.
The ECB has lifted rates by a combined 4.5 percentage points since July 2022 to combat runaway price growth but hinted last month that it would pause as record-high borrowing costs are starting to work their way through the economy.
Price pressures are finally easing and inflation has more than halved in a year, while the economy has slowed so much that a recession may be under way. That has boosted market bets that rate hikes are finished and the ECB’s next move will be a cut.
ADVERTISEMENT
ECB President Christine Lagarde told a press conference the euro zone economy was weak but stressed that price pressures remained strong and could be aggravated further if the Middle East conflict pushed energy costs higher.
“We have to be steady. This is the decision of today: We are holding,” Lagarde said, adding that any discussion of where interest rates might go in the future – including speculation about rate cuts – was premature.
“Sometimes inaction is action. A decision to hold is meaningful,” she said, adding that it was taken unanimously.
Speaking in Athens, where ECB policymakers held their meeting for the first time in 15 years, Lagarde said it was clear that the rate hikes put in place so far were having a big impact on the economy, notably in depressing bank lending.
ADVERTISEMENT
The euro initially dropped against the U.S. dollar before paring some of that decline to last trade down 0.2% at $1.0544. Euro zone bond yields fell, as did the spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields.
With Thursday’s move, the ECB’s deposit rate stays at a record high 4% while the main rate stands at 4.5%.
The decision to keep rates unchanged is likely to reinforce expectations that the world’s biggest central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are essentially done tightening policy after an unprecedented series of synchronized hikes.
ADVERTISEMENT
That is likely to shift market focus to just how long rates need to stay at their current highs, a tricky exercise as investors were betting on the next ECB move to be a cut as soon as June, with two full moves priced in by next October, a timeline some policymakers consider unrealistic.
The outlook for the economy appears to be increasingly precarious, putting a so-called “soft landing” in jeopardy.
Industry is in recession, sentiment indicators are pointing south, consumption is muted and even the labour market has started to soften, all suggesting a contraction in the second half of 2023.
“The economy is likely to remain weak for the remainder of this year,” said Lagarde. “But as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and the demand for euro area exports picks up, the economy should strengthen over the coming years.”
Euro zone inflation, which stood at 4.3% in September, is seen easing to around 3.1% in October when preliminary data are released next week. That remains well above the bank’s official inflation target of 2%.
NO TALK OF BOND PORTFOLIO REDUCTION
ADVERTISEMENT
The wording of the ECB’s statement on PEPP remained unchanged and the bank repeated its promise to reinvest all proceeds from maturing debt through the end of 2024.
Lagarde said there had been no discussion of an early reduction of bond holdings in the bank’s 1.7 trillion euro ($1.8 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some policymakers had publicly said that committing to reinvest proceeds from maturing debt was at odds with the goals of its policy tightening.
The complication is that the ECB uses these reinvestments as its “first line of defence” for vulnerable euro zone economies like Italy, because it can adjust its purchases of government bonds to insulate them from undue market volatility.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ecb-rates-on-hold-rejects-talk-future-cuts-9000887/,business
US economy accelerated to a strong 4.9% rate last quarter as consumers shrugged off Fed rate hikes,Last quarter’s robust growth may prove to be a high-water mark for the economy before a steady slowdown begins in the current October-December quarter and extends into 2024.,"The nation’s economy expanded at a robust 4.9% annual rate from July through September as Americans defied higher prices, rising interest rates and widespread forecasts of a recession to spend at a brisk pace.
The Commerce Department said the economy expanded last quarter at the fastest pace in more than two years — and more than twice the 2.1% annual rate of the previous quarter.
Thursday’s report on the nation’s gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — showed that consumers drove the acceleration, ramping up their spending on everything from cars to restaurant meals. Even though the painful inflation of the past two years has soured many people’s view of the economy, millions have remained willing to splurge on vacations, concert tickets and sports events.
ADVERTISEMENT
Last quarter’s robust growth, though, may prove to be a high-water mark for the economy before a steady slowdown begins in the current October-December quarter and extends into 2024. The breakneck pace is expected to ease as higher long-term borrowing rates, on top of the Federal Reserve’s short-term rate hikes, cool spending by businesses and consumers.
The growth figures for the third quarter revealed that federal, state, and local governments ramped up their spending, and businesses built up their stockpiles of goods in warehouses and on shelves, which helped drive growth higher. The economy managed to accelerate despite the Fed’s strenuous efforts to slow growth and inflation by raising its benchmark short-term interest rate to about 5.4%, its highest level in 22 years.

Several Fed officials acknowledged in speeches last week that the most recent economic data showed growth picking up by more than they had expected. Still, most of the policymakers signaled that they will likely keep their key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, unchanged when they meet next week.
A range of factors are helping fuel consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of the economy’s growth. Though many Americans are still feeling under pressure from two years of high inflation, average pay is starting to outpace price increases and enhance people’s ability to spend.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wages and salaries in the April-June quarter, the latest period for which data is available, rose 1.7% after adjusting for inflation, according to the Labor Department. That was the fastest quarterly increase in three years.
Americans, as a whole, also began the year on healthy financial footing, according to a report last week from the Fed. The net worth of a typical household jumped 37% from 2019 through 2022. Home prices shot higher, and the stock market rose in the biggest surge on records dating back more than 30 years.
At the same time, families benefited from the unusually low interest rates that lasted from the pandemic recession of 2020 until late last year. The typical household — the one midway between the richest and poorest — paid 13.4% of its income to cover interest on debts, the lowest such proportion on record.

Still, consumers are likely reining in their spending in the final three months of the year, and the sluggish housing market is dragging on the economy as well. This month, nearly 30 million people began repaying several hundred dollars a month in student loans, which could slow their ability to spend. Those loan repayments had been suspended when the pandemic struck three years ago.
The economy faces other challenges as well, including the prospect of a government shutdown next month and a spike in longer-term interest rates since July. The average 30-year mortgage rate is approaching 8%, a 23-year high, putting home buying out of reach for many more Americans.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in a discussion last week, said he was generally pleased with how the economy was evolving: Inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 3.7% from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. At the same time, steady growth and hiring have forestalled a recession, which was widely predicted at the end of last year.
If those trends continue, it could allow the Fed to achieve a highly sought-after “soft landing,” in which it would manage to slow inflation to its 2% target without causing a deep recession.
At the same time, Powell has acknowledged that if the economy were to keep growing robustly, the Fed might have to raise rates further. Its benchmark short-term rate is now about 5.4%, a 22-year high.
ADVERTISEMENT
Fed officials were surprised by a blowout government report last week on retail sales, which showed that spending at stores and restaurants jumped last month by much more than expected. Americans spent more both for necessities like gas and groceries as well as for discretionary items, such as cars and restaurant meals, on which consumers typically cut back if they are worried about a weakening economy.
And while high mortgage rates have depressed the sales of existing homes, the vast majority of homeowners are still paying low rates that are fixed for 30 years, meaning that their housing costs remain low even as the Fed hikes rates. That’s a contrast to homeowners in the United Kingdom and Europe, for example, who are more likely to have floating-rate mortgages. About eight in 10 U.S. homeowners have a mortgage rate below 5%, according to online brokerage Redfin.
ADVERTISEMENT
With inflation generally easing, the Fed is expected to keep its short-term rate unchanged when it meets next week. Many economists increasingly expect the central bank’s policymakers to keep rates on hold when they meet in December as well.

P-notes investment continues to swell for seventh month on robust macros,"This is the highest level since July 2017 -- when investment through the route stood at Rs 1.35 lakh crore, data from the Sebi showed.","Investment in the Indian capital markets through participatory notes rose over a six-year high at Rs 1.33 lakh crore at September-end, making it the seventh consecutive monthly increase, on the back of robust macroeconomic fundamentals.
This is the highest level since July 2017 — when investment through the route stood at Rs 1.35 lakh crore, data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed.
The latest data includes the value of p-note investments in Indian equity, debt, and hybrid securities. Participatory notes (P-notes) are issued by registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to overseas investors who wish to be part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly.

They, however, need to go through a due diligence process.
According to Sebi data, the value of p-note investments in Indian markets — equity, debt, and hybrid securities — stood at Rs 1,33,284 crore at the end of September as compared to Rs 1,28,249 crore a month earlier.
In comparison, investment through the route was Rs 1.23 lakh crore in July, Rs 1.13 lakh crore in June, Rs 1.04 lakh crore at May-end, Rs 95,911 crore at April-end, Rs 88,600 crore at March-end, Rs 88,398 crore at February-end and Rs 91,469 crore at January-end.
The growth in p-notes generally aligns with the trend in FPI flows. When there is a global risk to the environment, investment through this route increases, and vice-versa.

Market analysts say one of the prime factors for the growth in p-notes investments is the stable Indian economy against an uncertain global macro backdrop.
“Besides India’s robust macros and rising attractiveness as an investment destination, investments through p-notes offer other advantages like anonymity (Sebi registration not required), ease of trading, and tax savings in select cases. In general, p-notes follow broader FPI trend, ” Kedar Kadam, Director – Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors, said.
“With India projected to be the fastest growing economy in the world, strong corporate earnings trajectory and attractive demographics, we believe the flows into Indian equities will continue in the coming years so long as ease of investing continues via p-notes,” he added.

GST notices worth Rs 1 lakh crore issued to online gaming companies so far,"The government has amended the GST law, making it mandatory for overseas online gaming companies to register in India from October 1. But there is no data yet of overseas gaming companies registering in India, the official said.","Online gaming companies have been issued show cause notices worth Rs 1 lakh crore so far by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities for tax evasion and underpayment of taxes, a senior government official said Wednesday. Though the official refused to put a total number to the overall notices issued by GST authorities, he said notices were issued now as the time period for issuing notices for financial year 2017-18 was coming to an end.
“Online gaming companies have been served notices worth about Rs 1 lakh crore by GST authorities so far…for GST evasion, there are so many issues for which show cause notices have been issued. Cases are being investigated. It will be very difficult to attach a figure to the quantum of evasion,” the official said.
The government has amended the GST law, making it mandatory for overseas online gaming companies to register in India from October 1. But there is no data yet of overseas gaming companies registering in India, the official said.

In August, the GST Council clarified that 28 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be levied on the full value of bets placed on online gaming platforms. Since then, many gaming companies have received either an intimation notice or a show cause notice for short payment of GST. Amended legal provisions and rules for online gaming, horse racing and casinos came into effect from October 1, bringing into effect the 28 per cent GST at face value at entry level and mandatory registration for offshore online gaming companies in India. The online gaming companies claim they were paying taxes at the rate of 18 per cent as the games played on the platform were ‘games of skill’.
While gaming company Dream11 had got a show cause notice for evasion of Rs 40,000 crore, casino gaming company Delta Corp received multiple notices from GST authorities totalling Rs 23,204 crore for short-payment of taxes. Delta Corp Ltd has already got orders from the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court and Sikkim High Court restraining tax authorities from any further action on multiple GST demand notices.
A spate of GST notices have also been issued by authorities beginning from industry-specific investigations in sectors such as banking, insurance that later extended to online gaming and casinos. Subsequently, GST notices expanded to cover “underpayment” of tax, “incorrect availment of input tax credit” and “reconciliations differences” between returns filed and financials. This especially picked up pace before the end of limitation period on September 30 for sending show cause notices for FY 2017-18, which was the first year of the GST regime. Notices have also been sent for subsequent years from FY19 to FY22. The Tax Department has said that cases have been booked using “data analysis aided by advanced technical tools”. In a statement on October 18, DGGI said it detected GST evasion of Rs 1.36 lakh crore so far during FY24 involving voluntary payment of Rs 14,108 crore.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/gst-notices-worth-rs-1-lakh-crore-issued-to-online-gaming-companies-so-far-8999638/,business

RBI asks private banks to have at least two whole-time directors on boards,"The regulator said the number of WTDs will be decided by the board of the bank by taking into account factors such as the size of operations, business complexity, and other relevant aspects.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday directed private and wholly-owned subsidiaries of foreign banks to have at least two whole time directors (WTDs) on their boards. This means that these banks must have at least one WTD in addition to the Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
The regulator said the number of WTDs will be decided by the board of the bank by taking into account factors such as the size of operations, business complexity, and other relevant aspects.
Given the growing complexity of the banking sector, it becomes imperative to establish an effective senior management team in the banks to navigate ongoing and emerging challenges, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Establishment of such a team may also facilitate succession planning, especially in the background of the regulatory stipulations in respect of tenure and upper age limit for MD & CEO positions,” the RBI said in a notification.
It advised banks that currently do not meet this minimum requirement to submit their proposals for the appointment of WTDs within four months.
The RBI said that those banks which do not already have the enabling provisions regarding appointment of WTDs in their Articles of Association may first seek necessary approvals expeditiously so as to be in a position to comply with the requirements.
“While ensuring compliance to the above instructions, careful consideration shall also be given to meet the requirements under other applicable statutory/regulatory provisions,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
In April 2021, the RBI had issued norms for the appointment of directors and constitution of committees of the boards of private banks, including Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks. These norms were issued as part of the effort to strengthen the corporate governance in banks. In respect of tenure of MD&CEO and WTDs, the RBI had said that these posts cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years. The regulator also clarified that no person can continue as MD&CEO or WTD beyond the age of 70 years in the private banks.
“MD&CEO or WTD who is also a promoter/ major shareholder, cannot hold these posts for more than 12 years. However, in extraordinary circumstances, at the sole discretion of the Reserve Bank such MD&CEO or WTDs may be allowed to continue up to 15 years,” the RBI said.
These norms led to the sudden exit of Uday Kotak recently. On September 2, Kotak, who led the bank for over two decades, announced to step down as its Managing Director (MD) and CEO four months ahead of the end of his tenure. Last week, the bank said it has received the RBI’s approval for the appointment of veteran banker Ashok Vaswani as the MD and CEO.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-asks-private-banks-to-have-at-least-two-whole-time-directors-on-boards-8999606/,business

How to get an instant personal loan without a CIBIL Score,Learn how to get quick financial assistance with online instant personal loans without a CIBIL Score.,"Loans enable individuals to achieve their goals by overcoming financial obstacles and unforeseen expenses. An instant personal loan is a renowned category of lending that provides cash with flexible repayment terms. These loans are designed for those who need quick financial assistance, allowing greater accessibility. Obtaining instant personal loans online without a CIBIL Score has now emerged as a viable financial option. 
The CIBIL Score, commonly known as the credit score, is a numerical measure of an individual’s creditworthiness. A high CIBIL Score shows strong credit health, boosting the chances of a loan approval with favourable terms. However, obtaining an instant personal loan without a CIBIL Score can be difficult. 
Here are five tips for obtaining instant personal loans online without a CIBIL Score: 
ADVERTISEMENT
Look for pre-approved offers 
If you have a savings/salary account with any bank or have any existing relationship with an NBFC, chances are you may have a pre-approved loan offer already. Lending firms often offer pre-approved loans considering it has some record of your past transactions. It is advisable to explore these options first as they usually do not require a CIBIL Score and are faster to process.
Explore multiple lenders
Traditional banks may rely heavily on CIBIL Scores, making it challenging to secure a loan without one. However, NBFCs, online lenders and peer-to-peer lending platforms have now emerged and use alternative methods to assess creditworthiness. These platforms may consider factors beyond just credit scores, such as income, employment history, and banking transactions.
Apply with a co-applicant
Another way to increase your chances of securing a loan without a CIBIL Score is to apply as a co-applicant with someone who has a good credit history. Such a co-applicant is likely to reduce the risk of default in the eyes of the lender and give the assurance of repayment. 
Provide proof of stable income 
Demonstrating a steady source of income is crucial when applying for a loan without a CIBIL Score. This reassures the lender that you have the means to repay the borrowed amount. Be prepared to provide documents such as income statements, income tax returns, or bank statements to verify your income from all sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
Show financial responsibility
Financial responsibility is critical in obtaining the trust of potential lenders. It entails having healthy saving and demonstrating the ability to save funds for future needs. Furthermore, paying bills on time and managing spends wisely demonstrates a disciplined approach to financial matters, which enhances your credibility in the eyes of lenders. These actions assure them of your capability to handle borrowed funds responsibly.
Lenders such as Bajaj Finance Limited provide Insta Personal Loans of up to Rs. 12,76,500, without requiring you to go through a CIBIL Score check. Existing customers of this NBFC can take advantage of the pre-approved loan offers they receive. As Bajaj Finance confirms your credit score beforehand, you do not need to know your CIBIL Score when reviewing your pre-approved offer. We consider a variety of other aspects such as your financial history, income details, and more before establishing your Insta Personal Loan offer. 
New customers can also apply for an Insta Personal Loan by simply visiting the Insta Personal Loan page on the Bajaj Finserv website, clicking on ‘Check Offer’, and entering your mobile number and OTP to know the loan amount you qualify for.

China, the world’s top crude oil buyer, increased its oil refining capacity to 920 million tonnes per year, or 18.4 million barrels per day (bpd), in 2022, overtaking the United States as the world’s largest oil processor.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said it would limit new refining capacity, promote the upgrading and optimisation of refineries, and accelerate the closure of small and outdated plants, according a posting on its website that was dated Oct. 10.

The notice affirms a capacity cap of one billion tons, or 20 million barrels per day (bpd), that was first mentioned in October 2021, when Beijing announced an action plan for reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030.
The Wednesday posting, however, lays out more details on the curbs for the refining sector.
Refineries with an annual capacity of 10 million metric tons or more will account for 55% of processing facilities by 2025, the notice said, while any new refineries will have to have capacities of at least 10 million tons a year.
China will also promote energy efficiency and better carbon emission management in the refining industry, it said.

Authorities will audit key facilities to look at production capacities, crude oil sources and energy efficiency levels, and will build a national information database on the sector, the NDRC said.
Smaller oil processing facilities that often claim to be bitumen producers or are used to process heavy oil and chemicals will be banned, the planner said. New refineries will also be sited close to or integrated with petrochemical facilities making products such as ethylene and paraxylene.
“(New) refining capacity shall be further optimised in terms of regional planning to promote an orderly integration between refineries and petrochemical hubs,” the NDRC said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/china-1-billion-ton-cap-crude-oil-refining-capacity-2025-8998388/,business

"Gaza has oil markets on edge. That could build more urgency to shift to renewables, IEA head says","Fossil fuel prices are down from 2022 peaks, but “markets are tense and volatile,"" said the IEA in the report.","Tensions from the war in Gaza could help accelerate the move away from planet-warming fossil fuels like oil and gas and toward renewable energy, electric cars and heat pumps — similar to how sharp increases in the price of oil during the 1970s unleashed efforts to conserve fuel, the head of the International Energy Agency said.
“Today we are again facing a crisis in the Middle East that could once again shock oil markets,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. That comes on top of the stress on energy markets from Russia’s cutoff of natural gas to Europe over its invasion of Ukraine, he said.
“Put these two things together, and no one can convince me that oil and gas are safe and secure energy choices for countries or consumers,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the publication Tuesday of the IEA’s annual world energy outlook, which analyzes the global picture of energy supply and demand.

“This could further accelerate the energy transition around the world,” with renewable sources like wind or solar offering a “long lasting solution” to energy security issues as well as climate change, he said.
The attack on Israel by the militant organisation Hamas and the ensuing Israel military operations have raised fears of a wider Mideast conflict. So far oil price rises have been relatively moderate. International benchmark Brent crude traded at USD 90.17 per barrel Tuesday, up from around USD 84 on the eve of the Hamas attack. So far the fighting has not led to a supply interruption.
Fossil fuel prices are down from 2022 peaks, but “markets are tense and volatile,” said the IEA in the report.
“Some of the immediate pressures from the global energy crisis have eased, but energy markets, geopolitics, and the global economy are unsettled and the risk of further disruption is ever present,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Birol pointed out that there was “a major government response” to the energy supply concerns that arose 50 years ago from the Arab oil embargo imposed during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.
It sent oil prices nearly 300 per cent higher and led to the founding of the IEA in 1974 to help shape a collective response to the disruption. That was followed by the 1978 Iranian revolution, which added another price shock. At the time, the solutions included the rollout of nuclear power plants and the imposition of mileage standards for cars.
“This time, we have all of the available technologies,” Birol said. “We have solar, wind, nuclear power, electric cars. They will extend significantly around the world and it will be an additional boost to the energy transition.” He pointed to the rapid rollout of electric cars, saying that in 2020 only one in 25 cars was electric but in 2023 it was one in five. Meanwhile the share of fossil fuels in electricity generation has fallen from 70 per cent ten years ago to 60 per cent today and should reach 40 per cent by 2030, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Concerted international action at the upcoming United Nations climate conference is needed to expand use of clean technologies and find new ways of financing the massive investment that is needed, especially in the developing world, the IEA said.
The report also pointed to a shifting role for China, once a leading source of increased demand for energy due to rapid industrialization and growth. The report said energy demand there could peak as soon as 2025 amid slowing growth and “impressive” shifts to clean energy like solar and nuclear.
The IEA estimates that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030 under current policies but says governments will have to increase their efforts to speed up the transition if the world is to meet the global goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/gaza-oil-markets-on-edge-build-more-urgency-shift-renewables-iea-head-8997657/,business

India’s demand for electricity for ACs to exceed total power consumption of Africa: International Energy Agency,"India's demand for electricity for running household air conditioners is estimated to expand nine-fold by 2050 and will exceed total power consumption in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.","nrIndia’s demand for electricity for running household air conditioners is estimated to expand nine-fold by 2050 and will exceed total power consumption in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.
In its latest World Energy Outlook, IEA said India will see the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the world over the next three decades.
It projected India’s energy supply to rise from 42 exajoules (EJ) in 2022 to 53.7 EJ in 2030 and 73 EJ in 2050 under stated policies scenarios and 47.6 EJ by 2030 and 60.3 EJ by 2050 as per announced pledges.
ADVERTISEMENT
Oil demand is seen rising from 5.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 6.8 million bpd in 2030 and 7.8 million bpd in 2050 under stated policies scenario. Under announced pledges, this demand is seeking 6.2 million bpd in 2030 and 4.7 million bpd in 2050.
IEA said over the past five decades, India witnessed over 700 heatwave events, which have claimed over 17,000 lives. Fuelled by its geographic and meteorological conditions, air conditioner ownership in India has been steadily rising with growing incomes, tripling since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households.
“The impact of cooling needs on electricity consumption is already clear,” the Paris-based agency said.
“Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and in India’s case there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25-degree Celsius threshold..
ADVERTISEMENT
Electricity consumption due to space cooling increased 21 per cent between 2019 and 2022, and today nearly 10 per cent of electricity demand comes from space cooling requirements.
“Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines,” it said.
“Residential electricity demand from cooling increases ninefold in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) by 2050..
ADVERTISEMENT
IEA said by 2050, “India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners in the STEPS exceeds total electricity consumption in the whole of Africa today..
In the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), however, electricity demand for air conditioners is nearly 15 per cent lower in 2050 as it is in the STEPS as a result of increased use of energy-efficient air conditioners and thermal insulation in buildings. “This reduction itself is larger than the total electricity generation by several countries today, such as that of the Netherlands”.
The growth in ownership and use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment is one of the key drivers of the increase in peak electricity demand in India.
In the STEPS, peak electricity demand rise around 60 per cent from the 2022 level by 2030 and cooling accounts for nearly half of this increase.
In the APS, however, the implementation of building codes, the use of more efficient appliances and the adoption of demand response measures enable the same cooling needs to be met with less energy. This reduces peak electricity demand growth by nearly one-quarter compared to the STEPS. Given that the electricity system is sized to meet peak demand, lower peak demand helps to lower electricity investment needs and system costs.

Although solar PV matches well with daytime cooling needs, cooling demand is also significant in India during the late evening and at night.
“Lowering cooling demand through energy efficiency policies therefore reduces the need for investment in batteries or expensive standby generation capacity, and thus helps to integrate renewables more cost effectively,” IEA said.

IEA said India is moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.
Recognising the potential to transform its energy sector and reduce the import burden of fossil fuels while reducing CO2 emissions, India has announced a net zero emissions target by 2070, and has put in place policies to scale up clean energy supply and clean technology manufacturing.
ADVERTISEMENT
“While clean energy investment in India more than doubles in the STEPS by 2030 from around USD 60 billion in 2022, investment needs to nearly triple by the end of this decade to be on a trajectory to meet its net zero emissions target, which is reflected in the APS,” it said.
Although India’s population growth has slowed to reach replacement levels, its urban population increases by 74 per cent and per capita income triples by 2050. Industrial output expands rapidly, for example through a tripling of output of iron and steel, and doubling of cement, plus there is a ninefold increase in residential air conditioner ownership by 2050.
“As a result, demand for oil and natural gas increases in the STEPS by nearly 70 per cent between 2022 and 2050, while coal demand increases by 10 per cent, even as solar PV makes inroads into electricity generation. As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions still rise nearly 30 per cent by 2050, which is one of the largest increases in the world,” the outlook said.
In the APS, the increase in clean energy investment changes the outlook. In the STEPS, solar provides nearly 45 per cent of total generated power by 2050; in the APS, it crosses 50 per cent. In both the STEPS and APS, India achieves its target of 50 per cent non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030.
Clean energy investment in the APS over and above those in the STEPS also drives faster growth in electromobility, low-emissions hydrogen, grid expansions and other clean energy infrastructure.
“As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions fall sharply in the APS by over 40 per cent from current levels by 2050, even though its GDP quadruples over this period,” it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-electricity-demand-ac-exceed-total-power-consumption-africa-iea-8997377/,business
India to surpass Japan to become 2nd largest economy in Asia by 2030: S&P Global,"After two years of rapid economic growth in 2021 and 2022, the Indian economy has continued to show sustained strong growth during the 2023 calendar year.","India, the world’s fifth largest economy in the world, is likely to overtake Japan to become the world’s third-largest economy with a GDP of USD 7.3 trillion by 2030, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in its latest issue of PMI.
After two years of rapid economic growth in 2021 and 2022, the Indian economy has continued to show sustained strong growth during the 2023 calendar year.
India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow 6.2-6.3 per cent in the fiscal year ending in March 2024, being the fastest-growing major economy this fiscal year. Asia’s third-largest economy grew by a stellar 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter.

“The near-term economic outlook is for continued rapid expansion during the remainder of 2023 and for 2024, underpinned by strong growth in domestic demand,” S&P Global said.
The acceleration of foreign direct investment inflows into India over the past decade reflects the favourable long-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, helped by a youthful demographic profile and rapidly rising urban household incomes.
“India’s nominal GDP measured in USD terms is forecast to rise from USD 3.5 trillion in 2022 to USD 7.3 trillion by 2030. This rapid pace of economic expansion would result in the size of the Indian GDP exceeding Japanese GDP by 2030, making India the second largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region,” it said.
By 2022, the size of the Indian GDP had already become larger than the GDP of the UK and also France. By 2030, India’s GDP is also forecast to surpass Germany.

The US at present is the world’s largest economy with a GDP of USD 25.5 trillion. It makes up for a quarter of the world’s GDP. China is the second largest economy with a GDP size of about USD 18 trillion, which is almost 17.9 per cent of the world GDP. Japan is a distant third with USD 4.2 trillion GDP, followed by Germany with USD 4 trillion GDP.
S&P Global said the long-term outlook for the Indian economy is supported by a number of key growth drivers.
“An important positive factor for India is its large and fast-growing middle class, which is helping to drive consumer spending. The rapidly growing Indian domestic consumer market as well as its large industrial sector have made India an increasingly important investment destination for a wide range of multinationals in many sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and services,” it said.

The digital transformation of India that is currently underway is expected to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, changing the retail consumer market landscape over the next decade. This, S&P Global said, is attracting leading global multinationals in technology and e-commerce to the Indian market.
“By 2030, 1.1 billion Indians will have internet access, more than doubling from the estimated 500 million internet users in 2020,” it said. “The rapid growth of e-commerce and the shift to 4G and 5G smartphone technology will boost home-grown unicorns like online e-commerce platform Mensa Brands, logistics startup Delhivery and the fast-growing online grocer BigBasket, whose e-sales have surged during the pandemic.
The large increase in FDI inflows to India that has been evident over the past five years is also continuing with strong momentum evident even during the pandemic years of 2020-2022.
“India’s strong FDI inflows have been boosted by large inflows of investments from global technology MNCs such as Google and Facebook that are attracted to India’s large, fast-growing domestic consumer market, as well as a strong upturn in foreign direct investment inflows from manufacturing firms,” it said.
Overall, India is expected to continue to be one of the world’s fastest-growing economies over the next decade.

Little more optimistic about India’s growth than few months ago: RBI MPC member,RBI MPC member Jayanth R Varma said that India should be willing to accept inflation between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for several quarters as the price of avoiding a growth shock.,"RBI MPC member Jayanth R Varma on Tuesday said that he is ‘little more’ optimistic about India’s economic growth than a few months ago, though concerns remain as the country is now ‘disproportionately’ dependent on household spending with other components of demand encountering headwinds.
Varma further said that India should be willing to accept inflation between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for several quarters as the price of avoiding a growth shock.
“I am a little more optimistic about growth than I was 2-4 months ago. My cautious optimism stems from improved consumer confidence and various indicators that point to the continuation of the growth momentum,” he told PTI in a telephonic interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
While keeping the global growth projection for FY24 unchanged at 3 per cent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently revised its growth projection for India upwards by 20 basis points to 6.3 per cent in October.
“However, the outlook remains fragile because demand is now disproportionately dependent on household spending with other components of demand encountering headwinds,” the eminent economist emphasised.
Explaining further, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member said while external demand is weak due to the sluggishness in the world economy, the revival in private capital expenditure is still too tentative and muted.
“Fiscal consolidation amounts to a withdrawal of the pandemic era government spending stimulus,” Varma, currently a professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
India’s GDP growth in 2022-23 was 7.2 per cent, lower than 9.1 per cent in 2021-22.
According to the Reserve Bank of India’s projections, India’s GDP is likely to grow at 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal year.
Asked when inflation will fall back to the RBI’s target of 4 per cent, Varma said August inflation was high, but September inflation is within the band and October inflation is also expected to be low.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pointing out that India has been experiencing a lot of volatility in commodity and food prices over the last couple of years, he said in this context, a sharp rise or drop in inflation in one or two months does not mean anything.
“I am confident that we will achieve this goal, but I think it will take a few more quarters… We should be willing to accept inflation between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for several quarters as the price of avoiding a growth shock,” Varma said.
The eminent economist noted that a more rapid pace of reduction could impose an intolerable growth sacrifice.
Annual retail inflation, called CPI or consumer price index, rose 5.02 per cent in September from 6.83 per cent in the previous month on the back of softer vegetable prices.
Recently, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that the fundamental goal of the monetary policy is to align inflation with the 4 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations.
ADVERTISEMENT
RBI MPC in its last meeting earlier in the month, decided to keep the benchmark lending rate at 6.5 per cent, for the fourth time in a row, in a bid to keep retail inflation under check.
Responding to a question on the implication of high crude oil prices on the government’s subsidy figure and inflation, Varma stressed that there is no question that the conflicts in the Middle East pose risks to the world economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
“What I find reassuring is that oil prices have remained range-bound in the face of these conflicts,” he said, adding this is in his view suggestive of depressed global demand putting a lid on prices.
Varma, however, warned that of course, a bigger flare up in the region that takes us back to 1973 would be a very different situation, but as of now there is ground for guarded optimism.

Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.6%, to $90.40 a barrel by 0321 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures increased 54 cents, or 0.6%, to $86.03 a barrel.
“The market is up on an adjustment after a drop in the past two sessions and on nagging fears of possible supply disruptions in the Middle East,” said Yuki Takashima, economist at Nomura Securities.

Both benchmarks fell more than 2% on Monday as diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, the world’s biggest oil-supplying region, intensified to contain the conflict between Israel and Hamas, easing investor worries about supply disruptions.
Hamas on Monday said it had freed two Israeli women who were among the more than 200 hostages taken during its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel, while sources said the U.S. had advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault in the Gaza Strip.
But Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza on Monday after launching air strikes over southern Lebanon overnight.
“The Israel-Hamas situation remains highly fluid and clearly, the market remains divided over whether the conflict will continue to ease from here as Hamas continue to release hostages, or flares up again,” said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.

Israel pounded hundreds of targets in Gaza from the air on Monday as its soldiers fought Hamas militants during raids into the besieged Palestinian strip, where deaths are soaring and civilians are trapped in harrowing conditions.
“We expect WTI to move within the $80-$90 range for a while, with all eyes on the situation in Israel and Gaza, OPEC production and the pace of demand recovery in China,” Takashima said, adding investors were also focusing on U.S. inventory data.

Strong fundamentals to help India’s growth momentum: Finance Ministry report,"On the external front, there is sluggish export demand, which is expected to improve going ahead. “Sluggish global demand is affecting India’s trade, but this is projected to recover from H2FY24.","The outlook for the Indian economy for the current financial year 2023-24 remains “bright and is solidly underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals” even as there are significant headwinds and fresh challenges from adverse geopolitical turns and volatile crude prices, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly economic review for September on Monday.
The report noted that headline inflation has eased and remained within the upper tolerance limit of the medium-term target of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at 5 per cent in September indicating that the increase in inflation during July-August was only temporary, caused by the seasonal and weather-driven supply constraints in a few food items.

India will remain fastest-growing major economy in FY24: Finance Ministry report,"""Fraught geopolitical conditions can cause a general increase in global risk aversion. If these risks worsen and are sustained, they can affect economic activity in other countries, including India,"" the Finance Ministry said in its monthly report.","India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world in 2023-24 fiscal on the back of strong domestic fundamentals and benign inflation expectations, a finance ministry report said on Monday.
The September edition of the Monthly Economic Review also flagged that global uncertainties have been compounded by recent developments in the Persian Gulf and depending on how the situation develops, crude oil prices may push higher.
Further, the relentless supply of US Treasuries and continued restrictive monetary policy in the US (with further monetary policy tightening not ruled out) could cause financial conditions to be restrictive.

At current levels, US stock markets have greater downside risk than upside. If the downside risk materialises, it will have spill over effects on other markets, the report said.
“Fraught geopolitical conditions can cause a general increase in global risk aversion. If these risks worsen and are sustained, they can affect economic activity in other countries, including India,” the ministry said.
However, the report emphasised that India’s macroeconomic outlook for fiscal 2023-24 is bright and is solidly underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals. Alongside private consumption, investment demand is also firming up.
There are additional growth levers in broad-based industrial growth and buoyant residential property markets. Industrial capacity utilisation has improved.

Further, the report said improved reservoir levels augur well for the upcoming Rabi season. Core inflation is declining steadily while food inflation has eased.
The ministry noted that with a lower trade deficit and a comfortable forex reserves position, India’s external account looks robust. Echoing all this, Reserve Bank of India’s forward looking surveys on manufacturing, consumer confidence, employment and inflation expectations have optimistic findings.
“In sum, as IMF projections also confirm, India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world in FY24,” the report said.

While keeping the global growth projection for FY24 unchanged at 3 per cent, IMF revised its growth projection for India upwards by 20 basis points to 6.3 per cent in October.

"Reserve Bank of India’s $5 billion swap maturity causes flutter, but no major turbulence","The RBI's dollar/rupee swap, executed in April 2022, was undertaken to give banks dollar liquidity, which it will now withdraw, meaning banks who had entered into the swap will have to return the dollars.","The maturing of the Reserve Bank of India’s $5 billion swap on Monday led to a surge in demand for cash dollars and a drop in the overnight swap rate, but did not cause major disruptions in the premium and spot forex markets.
The RBI’s dollar/rupee swap, executed in April 2022, was undertaken to give banks dollar liquidity, which it will now withdraw, meaning banks who had entered into the swap will have to return the dollars.
One of the ways a bank can do that is by accessing the overnight swap market to borrow dollars vis-a-vis the rupee. A fall in the swap rate means there is a high demand for dollars.
ADVERTISEMENT
That rate, on Monday, dropped to 0.14 paisa, which equates to 0.07 paisa per day since the forex market is closed on Tuesday for a local holiday. Either way, the rate is well below the 0.17 paisa on Friday.
Based on the swap cost, the imputed rupee interest rate of 5.60% is well below the comparable 6.60% overnight rupee call rate.
In other words, the banks are willing to lend rupees at a cheaper rate to raise dollars, a sign that they are short of the greenback.
Currently, it seems this shortage will last for the short term, said Ritesh Bhusari, joint general manager for treasury at South Indian Bank.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If the global dollar shortage worsens and geopolitical risks accentuate, there may be (RBI) intervention through sell-buy swaps to manage dollar liquidity in the market,” he said.
Tracking the fall in the cash swap rate, rupee forward premiums, both near and far, extended their declines. The 2-month and 1-year premiums were at their lowest since mid-August and early September, respectively.
The rupee itself was in a narrow range and last quoted at 83.1575 per dollar.

If the swap rate had fallen into a discount, there would have been a larger drop in premiums and that “would have meant an additional source of pressure” for the rupee, a senior FX sales head at a private bank said.

Kotak Mahindra Bank drops over 2% after naming new CEO,Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank fell more than 2% on Monday after it named veteran banker Ashok Vaswani as managing director and CEO following founder Uday Kotak's resignation.,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank fell more than 2% on Monday after it named veteran banker Ashok Vaswani as managing director and CEO following founder Uday Kotak’s resignation, raising fears of volatility in the Indian lender’s business going forward.
Shares fell as much as 2.7% to 1,722.45 rupees on Monday. The stock was last down 1.2% at 1,749 rupees.
The private lender said on Saturday that the central bank has approved the appointment of the veteran international banker Vaswani, surprising analysts who had expected an insider would succeed the founder for the top job.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bank’s preference may have been for existing senior management, with KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram being top contenders for the CEO’s role, Jefferies’ analysts said in a note.
Jefferies downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy” and cut the target price to 1,940 rupees apiece from 2,400 rupees earlier.
Emkay said that the new CEO would have “a tall task” on his hands to manage senior management attrition or any “business dislocation.”
The brokerage maintained a “hold” rating on the stock and cut the target price to 1,955 rupees per share from 2,000 rupees earlier.

Moreover, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) caps the age of CEOs at 70, five years down the line, the bank would again be talking of leadership transition issues, assuming Vaswani serves two full three-year terms, Macquarie analyst Suresh Ganapathy said in a note.
By that time existing senior management, who were candidates for the chief executive’s position, could also possibly be out of the picture, Macquarie added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-naming-new-ceo-8995656/,business

Varma, Professor of Finance and Accounting at Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad, tells HITESH VYAS and GEORGE MATHEW that though bringing inflation below the upper tolerance band is required, there is a need for being more patient when it comes to gliding inflation to the 4 per cent target. “A more rapid pace of reduction could impose an intolerable growth sacrifice,” he says.

International banker Ashok Vaswani to head Kotak Mahindra Bank,"Vaswani has a proven track record spanning three-and-a-half decades, initially at Citigroup and more recently, at Barclays, of building and growing global businesses at scale.","Kotak Mahindra Bank on Saturday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) for a period of three years.
Vaswani, who has worked with Barclays in the recent past, will succeed Uday Kotak who quit as MD of the bank effective September 1. At present, Vaswani is President of Pagaya Technologies Ltd – a US-Israeli AI Fintech. He is also on the Board of the London Stock Exchange Group, the SP Jain Institute of Global Management, UK and supports various philanthropic organisations, including Pratham, and Lend-AHand.
The appointment is subject to shareholders’ approval, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement.

Vaswani has a proven track record spanning three-and-a-half decades, initially at Citigroup and more recently, at Barclays, of building and growing global businesses at scale, nurturing winning teams, establishing transformational partnerships, leveraging forward-leaning technology, with a compelling business vision to deliver strong bottom-line growth, it said.
Interim MD & CEO Kotak Mahindra Bank Dipak Gupta said, “Ashok brings with him values and experience that align with Kotak’s vision to transform into a tech-enabled, customer-centric financial institution for the future.” Founder director of the bank Uday Kotak said Ashok is a word-class leader and banker with digital and customer focus. I am proud that we bring a “Global Indian” home to build Kotak and India of tomorrow.” Kotak was set to retire from his executive role in December. However, it was cut short four months ahead of schedule. His early exit from the country’s fourth-largest bank was cited as a personal reason.
This came as the Reserve Bank of India capped the tenure of a managing director and chief executive officer at 15 years in private sector banks. This is due to the RBI’s norms on leadership appointment which was reviewed after the Yes Bank debacle. Kotak, whose holding in the bank stands at 26 per cent, has become a non-executive director of the bank.
Commenting on the appointment, Vaswani said, “We will ensure that Kotak Mahindra Bank plays a meaningful role in India’s journey to being one of the top 3 economies in the world in the next 5 years, delivering shareholder value. At a personal level, l am delighted to come back home.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/international-banker-ashok-vaswani-to-head-kotak-mahindra-bank-8993840/,business

Pilot issues are behind us; airline ‘dead set against’ no-poaching pact for pilots: Akasa Air CEO,"Akasa Air, which has been flying for more than a year, has more than 450 pilots and the number will go up as it expands the fleet from 20 aircraft now.","Akasa Air might be slowly coming out of the turbulence caused by sudden pilots’ exits but the airline’s chief Vinay Dube is “dead set against” the idea of having any kind of no-poaching agreement between airlines, asserting that it will not be right.
The airline, which has been flying for more than a year, has more than 450 pilots and the number will go up as it expands the fleet from 20 aircraft now.
“We had about 330 pilots in April. Approximately, 40 went away without (serving) notice period or with one day, two days or less than 24 hours. Today, we have little over 450 pilots… between April and today, we have probably added about a third of additional pilots despite a small number leaving,” Akasa Air Founder and CEO Vinay Dube told PTI.
ADVERTISEMENT
Following the sudden exit of pilots, many of whom apparently joined another carrier, Akasa Air had to cancel some flights in July and August. The carrier’s market share also took a hit due to the cancellations.
Also, the airline has initiated legal action against the pilots concerned.
While noting that the exit of some pilots without serving their notice periods was something completely unprecedented, Dube said that he does not think anything is needed at the airline industry level to prevent such instances in the future.
“We got the judicial clarity. So, I don’t think anything is required actually. The matter is behind us and really now, we are squarely in growth mode. The expectation is that our network will grow by 10 per cent in December and then over 33 per cent by March. So, really this is not an issue and nothing is required,” he said in an interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
To a query on whether there is a need for a no-poaching agreement among the airlines for pilots, the Akasa Air chief replied in the negative.
“Not at all. Absolutely not. I am dead set against it. I think pilots like any other employees should be completely allowed to work with whatever airline they want and I don’t believe that the airlines should collude on this topic at all. I don’t think there is a need and I don’t think it is right,” he asserted.
Currently, Akasa Air operates around 700 weekly flights and expects to have a total of 25 planes by the end of this financial year.
ADVERTISEMENT
Against the backdrop of alleged differences between the airline and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on the pilots’ issue, Dube said the regulator has always been incredibly helpful and efficient.
“From the very beginning, we got our AOC (Air Operator Certificate) and the airline started in less than 24 months. That is as efficient as it gets from the regulatory perspective. It is just that the judicial order that was passed lacked a bit of clarity from their perspective which were able to get subsequently. I would not say they were not helpful because they were incredibly helpful and efficient.
“We have the clarity now and it says that pilots need to respect the contractual notice period,” Dube said.
About competition in the Indian aviation market, especially when it comes to airfares, Dube said that he thinks India and Indian consumers have some of the most attractive fares when compared to other mature aviation economies despite the fact that a large chunk of the cost structure of the Indian aviation sits with dollar currency.
“Fuel is pegged to dollar in Brent, good chunk of maintenance is pegged to dollar, our aircraft leasing is pegged to dollar. Given that, Indian consumers have some of the best fares relative to other large aviation economies. I think there is a good amount of competition and by the way, we are happy to compete,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/pilot-issues-behind-us-airline-dead-set-against-no-poaching-pact-pilots-akasa-air-ceo-8992496/,business

India to meet its FY24 deficit goal despite extra spending: IMF,"Earlier, this month, India hiked the cooking gas subsidy for low income households to 300 rupees per cylinder from 200 rupees announced in August.","India has room to absorb additional expenditure towards subsidies and rural unemployment programme without raising its fiscal deficit target from 5.9% set for the current financial year, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.

Shares of Wipro, which also posted an unexpected drop in revenue in the July-September quarter, fell as much as 4.3% in their steepest intraday percentage decline since mid-April. The Nifty IT index dropped 0.5%.
While the IT sector has been contending with soft demand for the past few quarters, leading to the likes of Infosys cutting its full-year forecast, analysts believe Wipro’s higher exposure to consulting hurt it more than its peers.

“Given Wipro’s broader presence in the discretionary areas, the conversion is a challenge as enterprises are cautious and are reprioritising expenditures,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.
Wipro said it expects its IT services revenue, which is nearly all of its business, would drop 3.5% to 1.5%, on a constant currency basis, sequentially in the third quarter. That is steeper than the 0.5% sequential drop in the second quarter.

Currently, the airline that completed first year of operations in August, has a fleet of 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and 2 more planes are expected to be inducted into its fleet by the end of this year.
Asserting that Akasa Air is in a “growth mode” with strong financials, Dube said the airline will announce a triple-digit aircraft order in 75 days or by the end of this year.

“We have just been given traffic rights for Riyadh, Jeddah, Doha and Kuwait. The process will take time… we will let the process unfold.
“We continue to be in a very very exciting phase in our lives now. We are doing strong financially. We have a good cash position,” he told PTI in an interview.
The carrier has received approval from the civil aviation ministry for rights to operate flights to Riyadh and Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), Doha (Qatar) and Kuwait.
Now, the airline will work with the foreign governments concerned for various other approvals to start international operations and that will take some time.
ADVERTISEMENT
On when the first international flight is likely to commence, the Akasa Air Founder and CEO said it will be a little difficult at this point for the airline to nail down the timeline.
“The Indian government is extremely efficient but then we have to work with various foreign governments, (in) three different countries. Timelines for approvals from these countries will vary… It is soon enough,” he said.
At present, Akasa Air operates around 700 weekly flights and flies to 16 cities.

In September, the airline carried 5.17 lakh passengers and had a domestic market share of 4.2 per cent, according to the latest official data.
To a query about rumours that the airline is facing funding issues, Dube said, “we are cash flow positive… we continue to add to our reserves”.
“We don’t need funding to place a triple-digit order in the next 75 days. We also hear rumours about the Jhunjhunwala family leaving which are absurd and the family says that they are invested with us for the long run,” he added.
Recently, Akasa Air faced pilots’ issues after some of them left without serving the required notice period that resulted in cancellation of various scheduled flights.The airline has moved the court against those pilots.
When asked about the issue, Dube said, “the matter is behind us and really now, we are squarely in growth mode”.

The world’s second-largest economy grew 4.9 per cent year-over-year in the July-September quarter, beating the 4.5 per cent forecast by analysts but slowing from the 6.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter, according to official data released on Wednesday.
On a quarterly basis, the economy grew by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter, compared to 0.8 per cent growth in the April-to-June quarter.

For the first nine months of the year, China’s economy grew 5.2 per cent compared to the same period last year, suggesting it is on track with Beijing’s target of about 5 per cent growth for 2023.
Officials from the National Bureau of Statistics cautioned that the external environment was becoming “more complex and grave” and warned that domestic demand remained insufficient.
Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said that although the numbers beat expectations China’s economy is “not out of the woods by any means”.
“This growth suggests a modest improvement in the Chinese economy. However, there are ongoing calls for increased policy support to maintain consistent growth, as there are concerns about the sustainability of the recovery,” Innes said in a note.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Chinese government in recent months has unveiled a raft of policy support measures to shore up the economy, including infrastructure spending, cutting interest rates and easing curbs for home-buying in an attempt to revive the property sector.
China’s trade data, released earlier this week, showed that exports and imports continued to decline although they contracted at a slower rate than previously.
Beijing is aiming for 5 per cent economic growth this year. Analysts estimate that China is likely to reach its goal, although that growth is likely to slow to 4.5 per cent in 2024.

Earlier this year, growth was boosted as people flocked to shopping malls and restaurants after nearly three years of “zero-COVID” restrictions were removed in late 2022. However, growth from the post-pandemic recovery fizzled out sooner than expected.
Retail sales, an indicator of consumer demand, rose 5.5 per cent in September from the same period in 2022.

The G20 Roadmap on crypto assets is a detailed and action-oriented roadmap that will help coordinate global policy as well as develop mitigating strategies and regulations on such assets while also taking into consideration the specific implications on Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs).
The Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) communique drew guidance from the G20 New Delhi Leaders Declaration (NDLD) and benefited significantly from the consensus that was reached at the Leaders’ Summit last month, a press statement issued by the finance ministry said.
The communique was unanimously adopted at the fourth and final meeting of the G20 FMCBG under the Indian Presidency in Marrakesh, Morocco on the sidelines of the IMF-WB Annual Meetings.
With regard to Strengthening Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), the communique said that the ministers committed themselves to pursuing ambitious efforts to evolve and strengthen MDBs to address the global challenges of the 21st century with a continued focus on addressing the development needs of low and middle-income countries.

The ministers appreciated the work undertaken by the G20 Independent Expert Group (IEG) in preparing Volume 2 of their report.
The board of each MDB will be best placed to determine if and when a capital increase is needed in addition to CAF measures to support efforts in addressing global challenges and meeting development needs, it said.

Going forward, it said, “we call on the International Financial Architecture Working Group to deliberate on the IEG recommendations in consultation with MDBs and suggest a way forward for better, bigger and more effective MDBs, including ways to work together better as a system, in our meeting in April 2024.” It called upon the IMF and World Bank to report by our next meeting on the work undertaken to support efforts at enhancing domestic resource mobilisation of EMDEs, considering each country’s circumstances.

It also appreciated the efforts of the International Financial Architecture Working Group in taking forward the work on the debt agenda, including the preparation of the G20 Note on the Global Debt Landscape.

Appreciating the critical step taken by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in finalising guidance on trusts and other legal arrangements, the communique said “we commit to effectively implement the associated revised standard on beneficial ownership transparency.” It welcomed the positive developments in FATF towards revising its standards on asset recovery and reinforcing global asset recovery networks so as to enhance global efforts to recover criminal proceeds promptly and effectively.

In a video message to the Kaushal Deekshant Samaroh of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, the prime minister noted that new possibilities are being created for the youth as India’s economy is expanding.
He said that employment creation in India has reached a new height and the unemployment rate in India is at its lowest level in 6 years according to a recent survey.

Noting that unemployment is decreasing rapidly in both rural and urban areas of India, the prime minister emphasised that the benefits of development are reaching both villages and cities equally, and as a result, new opportunities are increasing equally in both villages and cities.
He also pointed out the unprecedented increase in the participation of women in India’s workforce and credited the impact of the schemes and campaigns that have been launched in India in the past years regarding women empowerment.
He pointed out the neglect towards skill development in the previous governments and said, “Our government understood the importance of skill and created a separate ministry for it and allocated a separate budget.” Highlighting the importance of skilling, upskilling and re-skilling, the prime minister noted the rapidly changing demands and nature of jobs and emphasized upgrading the skills accordingly.
Therefore, the prime minister said, it is very important for industry, research and skill development institutions to be in tune with the present times. Noting the improved focus on skills, the prime minister informed that about 5,000 new ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes) have been set up in the country in the last 9 years adding more than 4 lakh new ITI seats.

He also mentioned that institutes are being upgraded as model ITIs with the objective of providing efficient and high-quality training along with best practices.
Modi underlined that India is investing more in the skills of its youth than ever before and gave the example of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana which has strengthened the youth at the ground level.
Under this scheme, the prime minister informed that about 1.5 crore youths have been trained so far. He further added that new skill centres are also being established near industrial clusters which will enable the industry to share its requirements with skill development institutes, thereby developing the necessary skill sets among the youth for better employment opportunities.

The prime minister stressed making India the biggest centre of skilled manpower in the world in order to provide smart and skilled manpower solutions.
Highlighting the recent figures released by the International Monetary Fund, the prime minister informed that India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the coming years.
He also recalled his resolve to take India among the top three economies of the world and said that IMF is also confident of India becoming the top three economies of the world in the next 3-4 years. Modi underlined that it would create new opportunities for employment and self-employment in the country.
“Today, the whole world is of the belief that this century is going to be India’s century,” the prime minister said as he credited the young population of India for this.
The prime minister observed that when the elderly population is increasing in many countries of the world, India is getting younger with each passing day.

“India has this huge advantage,” he stressed as he noted the world is looking towards India for its skilled youth.
The prime minister suggested not to waste any opportunity being created and assured that the government is ready to support the cause.

Modi highlighted the importance of the power of the youth in utilizing the strengths of any country such as its natural or mineral resources, or its long coastlines and said that the country develops more with stronger youth power thereby doing justice to the nation’s resources.
Today, the prime minister emphasized that a similar thinking is empowering India’s youth, which is making unprecedented improvements in the entire ecosystem.

“In this, the country’s approach is two-pronged,” the prime minister said.
He explained that India is preparing its youth to take advantage of new opportunities through skilling and education as he highlighted the new National Education Policy which has been established after almost 4 decades.
The prime minister also underlined that the government is establishing a large number of new medical colleges and skill development institutes like IITs, IIMs or ITIs, and mentioned the crores of youth who have been trained under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana.
On the other hand, he stated that traditional sectors which provide jobs are being strengthened while new sectors that promote employment and entrepreneurship are also being promoted.
The prime minister also mentioned India making new records in goods exports, mobile exports, electronic exports, services exports, defence exports and manufacturing, and at the same time creating a large number of new opportunities for youth in many sectors such as space, startups, drones, animation, electric vehicles, semiconductors, etc.
Modi informed that India’s proposal regarding global skill mapping has been recently accepted at the G20 Summit, which will help in creating better opportunities for youth in the coming times.
India’s unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and above was recorded at a six-year low of 3.2 per cent during July 2022-June 2023, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Annual Report 2022-2023 released by the National Sample Survey Office this week.

Equity mutual funds witnessed an inflow of Rs 20,245 crore in August, according to the data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) released on Wednesday.
Despite the decline, inflow through SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 16,042 crore last month. In the first six months of the current financial year, the total SIP amount stood at Rs 90,304 crore, clocking a healthy run rate of Rs 15,050 crore.

The flow in September also marks the 31st consecutive month of net inflows. The equity segment was aided by six new fund launches in September which garnered Rs 2,503 crore.

While overall net flows experienced a dip in various categories of equity funds, thematic or sectoral funds extended their positive trend into the current month, attracting the highest net inflows.

Thematic funds saw the highest inflows to the tune of Rs 3,147 crore during the month. The spike in the flows of this category could also be attributed four new fund launches in this category which cumulatively garnered Rs 1,629 crore.

“The dip in the net flows of these (small-cap and mid-cap) categories could be attributed to some bit of profit booking by investors coupled with concerns regarding inflated valuations in some of these segments, “Melvyn Santarita, Analyst – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said.
The flow in small cap funds can be attributed to certain fund houses temporarily halting inflows, possibly due to concerns about rich valuations in the mid and small-cap space, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company’s Chaturvedi said.
NS Venkatesh, CEO, AMFI, said that mutual fund industry’s growth has been on an upward trend. The half yearly growth has been encouraging and he is optimistic that the trend will continue to grow.

The IPO raised about $1.48 billion based on 32.3 million shares sold and values the company at about $9.3 billion on a fully diluted basis.
Birkenstock is the fourth major company to launch a U.S. IPO in the last four weeks following those of chip designer Arm Holdings, grocery deliver app Instacart and marketing automation platform Klaviyo.

The slew of recent listings briefly raised hopes of a broad recovery in equity capital markets after a nearly 18-month dry spell. However, the three newly listed companies gave up most of their share price gains in the days following their IPOs, raising concerns over the near-term outlook for new stock market launches.
While shares of Arm and Klaviyo still trade above their IPO price, Instacart’s stock is now worth less than its IPO value.
Birkenstock was founded in 1774 in the German village of Langen-Bergheim by Johannes Birkenstock and his younger brother Johann Adam Birkenstock, who were both shoemakers. The Birkenstock family ran the business for six generations after its founding.
The brand has been seeking to position itself as a fashionable item worn by models and celebrities. Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, wore a pink pair of Birkenstocks in the final scene of the movie released this summer.

L Catterton, the private equity group backed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault and luxury goods empire Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock in 2021.
After the IPO, L Catterton will hold an 82.8% stake in Birkenstock and control a majority of the combined voting power of its outstanding shares.
Birkenstock’s shares will start trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BIRK”.

Asian shares rise after eased pressure on bonds pushes Wall Street higher,US futures were little changed and oil prices rose slightly.,"Shares advanced Wednesday in Asia, tracking Wall Street gains following an easing of pressure from the bond market.
US futures were little changed and oil prices rose slightly.
In China, investor sentiment got a boost from a report by Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, that the government is considering boosting spending on construction to support the economy.

China’s lackluster recovery from the blows to its economy during the COVID-19 pandemic have weighed heavily on regional and global growth.
The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.4 per cent to 17,919.55 and the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.2 per cent at 3,081.22.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.9 per cent to 32,019.42.
In South Korea, the Kospi jumped 2.5 per cent, to 2,462.10 after Samsung Electronics reported improved quarterly earnings. Samsung’s shares surged 4.4 per cent, while SK Hynix’s were up 3.3 per cent. Analysts say the worst of the post-pandemic contraction in demand for computer chips and electronic devices may be over.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.6 per cent to 7,085.70. In India, the Sensex added 0.7 per cent and in Bangkok the SET was up 0.8 per cent.

Investors have taken heart amid signs that upward pressure on inflation in many economies may be easing, which would enable the Federal Reserve and other central banks to halt or reverse aggressive interest rate hikes meant to curb rising prices.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 4,358.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 33,739.30, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 13,562.84.
PepsiCo rose 1.9 per cent after it reported stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than analysts expected.

Some of the strongest action was in the bond market, where Treasury yields eased after trading resumed following a holiday on Monday. It was the first opportunity for yields to move since the weekend’s surprise attack by Hamas on Israel injected caution into global markets.
Perhaps more impactfully, it was also the first trading for Treasurys since speeches by Federal Reserve officials that traders took as a suggestion the Fed may not raise its main interest rate again. The comments helped US stocks swing from early losses to gains on Monday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury has fallen to 4.64 per cent from 4.80 per cent late Friday, which is a considerable move for the bond market. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed’s actions, sank to 4.97 per cent from 5.09 per cent.
Treasury yields had jumped last week to their highest levels in more than a decade, following the lead of the Fed’s main interest rate, which is at heights unseen since 2001. They’ve been the main reason for the stock market’s stumbles since the summer, as worries rise that the Fed will keep its federal funds rate at a high level for longer than Wall Street hopes.
High rates and longer-term yields knock down prices for stocks and other investments, while slowing the economy in hopes of undercutting high inflation.

But the swift rise in the 10-year Treasury yield has helped pull the average long-term mortgage rate up to its highest level since 2000, and Fed officials have intimated such moves may help contain high inflation on their own.
“I actually don’t think we need to increase rates anymore,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in remarks before the American Bankers Association on Tuesday. “I think we are at a good place in that regard.” The Fed’s next announcement on interest rates is due Nov. 1. Traders are now betting on a nearly 73 per cent chance that the year will end without any more Fed rate hikes, according to data from CME Group. That’s up from the 53 per cent chance seen a week ago.

"Infra woes and labour issues apart, protectionism could deter investment flows: German envoy","Currently, around 600 German companies associated with VDMA have subsidiaries present in India, out of which around 170 have production and/or assembly operations.","Boosting India’s domestic manufacturing push should not lead to a situation where foreign investors feel marginalised, Germany’s ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann, said at a press conference organised at the German embassy on Tuesday. Alongside highlighting the need for more infrastructure and skilled labour, Ambassador Ackermann also flagged the risk of protectionism in attracting foreign investments into India from countries like Germany. He said, “We understand the Indian government’s wish and desire to promote more manufacturing but it should not lead to a situation where foreign investment and investors get marginalised.”
Ackermann also noted that concluding the free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations between India and the European Union by year-end seemed “ambitious”. “There’s a fair chance that that’s not going to happen. My hope is to do it as quickly as possible. We are very much in favour of a free trade agreement and we are pushing hard but there is still a long way to go,” he added.

This, along with technology interventions and enhanced disclosures by taxpayers in income tax returns, has aided the growth in personal income tax collections, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Nitin Gupta said Tuesday. Gross direct tax collections have grown by 17.95 per cent to Rs 11.07 lakh crore so far this fiscal during April 1-October 9, while net direct tax mop-up, which factors in refunds, rose 21.82 per cent year-on-year to Rs 0.57 lakh crore.
The CBDT Chairman underlined that the tax department will “surpass” its Budget targets when asked about concerns being raised about a lower rate of growth in corporate tax revenue compared with the personal income tax revenue growth. “For the corporates, the tax rates have come down…but despite that we are getting good numbers. The growth is in PIT (Personal Income Tax) more than the corporates. On net basis, corporate is around 7.3 per cent and PIT is around 29.5 per cent,” Gupta said.

"States borrowing cost soars to 7.68%, highest so far this fiscal",The prices shot up reflecting the overall higher risk averseness of investors with the rising interest rates.,"States have been forced to pay through their nose at the weekly auction of their debt on Tuesday with the weighted average interest rate payable soaring to the highest so far this fiscal at 7.68 per cent, 12 basis points (bps) more than the previous peak at the last auction.
The prices shot up reflecting the overall higher risk averseness of investors with the rising interest rates along with higher demand, which rose by 14 per cent at the auction in spite of a jump in the average tenor to 15 years from 13 years last week.
Eight states raised Rs 9,600 crore through state government securities (SGS) on Tuesday, which is 13.6 per cent higher than the amount indicated for this week in the auction calendar, according to Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra Ratings.
ADVERTISEMENT
The sharp increase in the cutoffs of the 10-year and above issuances in the auction pushed the weighted average cut-off to 7.68 per cent, the highest in FY24 so far, up from 7.56 per cent last week, she said.
The weighted average tenor also increased to 15 years from 13 years last week.
As a result, the spread between the cut-off of the 10-year SGS and the 10-year G-sec (7.18 GS 2033) yield also rose to a 20-week high of 37 bps on Tuesday, from 33 bps last week, she said.
Cumulatively, the states have drawn down 28 per cent more funds than they had availed of in the same period last year at Rs 3,90,100 crore as of the latest auction today, up from Rs 3,04,700 crore in the year-ago period.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/states-borrowing-cost-soars-to-7-68-pc-the-highest-so-far-this-fiscal-8976977/,business

IMF raises India’s GDP growth forecast marginally to 6.3% for FY24,"IMF in July had estimated India's GDP forecast at 6.1 per cent for 2023-24. However, this is lower than the RBI's latest estimate of 6.5 per cent for the current financial year.","International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday raised India’s GDP projection marginally by 0.2 per cent to 6.3 per cent even as it slashed the global growth forecast to 3 per cent.
IMF in July had estimated India’s GDP forecast at 6.1 per cent for 2023-24. However, this is lower than the RBI’s latest estimate of 6.5 per cent for the current financial year.
However, India’s growth is projected to be higher than China’s, the third-largest economy in the world.
ADVERTISEMENT
IMF’s ‘World Economic Outlook’ revised China’s growth forecast downward by 0.2 percentage points for 2023 and by 0.3 percentage points for 2024 to 5 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.
With the property market crisis in that country, lower investment is the main contributor to the revision, it said.
“Growth in India is projected to remain strong, at 6.3 per cent in both 2023 and 2024, with an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2023, reflecting stronger-than-expected consumption during April-June,” the ‘World Economic Outlook’ said.
Monetary policy projections are consistent with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation target over the medium term, it noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government has mandated the RBI to keep CPI inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.
Observing that the food security concerns prompted recent export restrictions in the world’s largest rice exporter India, it said, risks to prices are tilted to the upside, stemming mostly from the ramifications of the end of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and uncertain effects of El Nino, possibly exacerbated by the proliferation of food export restrictions.
On the oil import, it said about 35 to 40 per cent of India’s crude oil imports came from Russia during April-June 2023, a stark rise from less than 5 per cent before the war in Ukraine.
ADVERTISEMENT
“While India’s oil exports (mostly petroleum products) are small relative to its oil imports (mostly crude oil), India increased its oil exports to the European Union substantially,” it said.
Last week, the World Bank retained India’s growth forecast at 6.3 per cent for the current financial year on the back of robust service activities despite global headwinds.
In India, which accounts for the bulk of the South Asia region, growth is expected to remain robust at 6.3 per cent in 2023-24, India Development Update of the World Bank said.
The World Bank had projected 6.3 per cent GDP growth in its April report as well. India recorded 7.2 per cent growth in 2022-23.
Last month, Asian Development Bank (ADB) marginally lowered India’s growth forecast to 6.3 per cent for the current financial year.

IMF outlook worsens for a world economy left ‘limping’ by shocks like Russia’s war,The IMF said it expects global economic growth to slow to 2.9 per cent in 2024 from an expected 3 per cent this year. The forecast for next year is down a notch from the 3 per cent it predicted back in July.,"The world economy is losing momentum in the face of higher interest rates, the ongoing war in Ukraine and widening geopolitical rifts, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday.
The IMF said it expects global economic growth to slow to 2.9 per cent in 2024 from an expected 3 per cent this year. The forecast for next year is down a notch from the 3 per cent it predicted back in July.
The deceleration comes at a time when the world has yet to fully mend from a devastating but short-lived COVID-19 recession in 2020.
ADVERTISEMENT
A series of shocks, including the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has slashed worldwide economic output by about USD 3.7 trillion over the past three years compared with pre-COVID trends.
“We see a global economy that is limping along,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters ahead of the IMF and World Bank’s fall meetings this week in Marrakech, Morocco.
The IMF expectation of 3 per cent growth this year is down from 3.5 per cent in 2022 but unchanged from its July projections.
The news isn’t all bad. The world economy has displayed “remarkable resiliency,” Gourinchas said, at a time when the US Federal Reserve and other central banks worldwide have aggressively raised interest rates to combat a resurgence in inflation.
ADVERTISEMENT
The hikes have helped ease price pressures without putting many people out of work.
That combination, he said, is “increasingly consistent” with a so-called soft landing — the idea that inflation can be contained without causing a recession.
The IMF sees global consumer price inflation dropping from 8.7 per cent in 2022 to 6.9 per cent this year and 5.8 per cent in 2024.
ADVERTISEMENT
The United States is a standout in the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF upgraded its forecast for US growth this year to 2.1 per cent (matching 2022) and 1.5 per cent in 2024 (up sharply from the 1 per cent it had predicted in July).
The US, an energy exporter, has not been hurt as much as countries in Europe and elsewhere by higher oil prices, which shot up after Russia invaded Ukraine last year and jumped more recently because of Saudi Arabia’s production cuts.
And American consumers have been more willing than most to spend the savings they accumulated during the pandemic.
Things are gloomier in the 20 countries that share the euro currency and are more exposed to rising energy prices.
The IMF downgraded eurozone growth to 0.7 per cent this year and 1.2 per cent in 2024. It actually expects the German economy to shrink by 0.5 per cent this year before recovering to 0.9 per cent growth next year.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Chinese economy, the world’s second biggest, is forecast to grow 5 per cent this year and 4.2 per cent in 2024 — both downgrades from what the IMF expected in July.
China’s economy was expected to bounce back this year after the communist government ended draconian “zero-COVID” lockdowns that had crippled growth in 2022. But the country is struggling with troubles in its overbuilt housing market.
ADVERTISEMENT
The IMF again expressed concern that the countries of the world were breaking into geopolitical blocs that could limit international trade and economic growth globally.
The United States and its allies have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and have sought to become less reliant on Chinese imports as tensions with Beijing grow.
ADVERTISEMENT
The IMF noted that last year countries imposed nearly 3,000 new restrictions on trade, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2019.
It sees international trade growing just 0.9 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent in 2024, down sharply from the 2000-2019 annual average of 4.9 per cent.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/imf-outlook-world-economy-worsens-left-limping-shocks-russia-war-8976374/,business

Oil dips on investor caution as market eyes Middle East turmoil,"Oil prices eased on Tuesday after rallying more than 4% in the previous session, with traders cautious as they watched for potential supply disruptions amid military clashes between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.","Oil prices eased on Tuesday after rallying more than 4% in the previous session, with traders cautious as they watched for potential supply disruptions amid military clashes between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Brent crude fell 56 cents, or 0.6%, to $87.59 a barrel by 0630 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude eased 56 cents, or 0.6%, to $85.82 a barrel.
Both benchmarks surged more than $3.50 on Monday as the clashes raised fears that the conflict could spread beyond Gaza into the oil-rich region. Hamas launched the largest military assault on Israel in decades on Saturday, while fighting continued into the night on Monday as Israel retaliated with a wave of air strikes on Gaza.

“There is still plenty of uncertainty across markets following the attacks in Israel over the weekend,” said ING analysts on Tuesday, adding that oil markets are now pricing in a risk premium.
“If reports of Iran’s involvement turn out to be true, this would provide another boost to prices, as we would expect to see the U.S. enforcing oil sanctions against Iran more strictly. That would further tighten an already tight market,” the ING analysts added.
While Israel produces very little crude oil, markets worried that if the conflict escalates it could hurt Middle East supply and worsen an expected deficit for the rest of the year.
Israel’s port of Ashkelon and its oil terminal have been shut in the wake of the conflict, sources said on Monday.

Iran is complicit even though the United States has no intelligence or evidence that points to Iran’s direct participation in the attacks, a White House spokesperson said on Monday.
“If the U.S. finds evidence directly implicating Iran, then the immediate reduction in Iran’s oil exports becomes a reality,” said Vivek Dhar, an energy analyst at CBA.
“We continue to believe that Brent oil will ultimately stabilise between $90-$100/bbl in Q4 2023,” said Dhar, adding that the Palestine-Israel conflict raises the risk of Brent futures tracking at $100/bbl and above.

The area embroiled in conflict is not home to major oil production, but fears that the fighting could impact the crude market sent a barrel of US oil up USD 3.59 to USD 86.38. Brent crude, the international standard, rose USD 3.57 to USD 88.15 per barrel.

One potential outcome of the violence is a slowdown in Iranian oil exports, which have been growing this year, according to Barclays energy analyst Amarpreet Singh. Less supply of crude would raise its price, all else equal.
The conflict could also hurt the possibility of improving relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which is the world’s second-largest producer of oil.
Oil prices already were volatile. A barrel of US crude had jumped from less than USD 70 during the summer to more than USD 90 last week, raising the pressure on inflation and the overall economy. It pulled back sharply last week before jumping again after the fighting began in Israel.
Monday’s rise in crude helped oil and gas stocks to some of Wall Street’s biggest gains. Marathon Oil rose 6.6 per cent, and Halliburton climbed 6.8 per cent.
Stocks of defence contractors that make weapons were also particularly strong. Northrop Grumman rallied 11.4 per cent, and L3Harris Technologies gained 10 per cent.

On the opposite end were companies that count fuel as among their biggest expenses. United Airlines sank 4.9 per cent, and Carnival fell 4.3 per cent.
But it’s interest rates, and expectations for where they will go, that have been driving Wall Street’s swings more than anything since the start of last year.

Wall Street hates higher interest rates because they knock down prices for stocks and other investments. They also make it more expensive for all kinds of companies and households to borrow money, which puts the brakes on the economy.
The 10-year yield fell to 4.64 per cent after rising to 4.80 per cent, up from 3.50 per cent during the summer and from just 0.50 per cent early in the pandemic. Trading in the US Treasury market was closed Monday for a holiday.

Global coal industry expected to layoff over 4 lakh miners by 2035: Report,"The coal industry is expected to shed more than four lakh mining jobs, equivalent to nearly 100 workers per day, by 2035, even without climate pledges or policies to phase out coal, with China and India likely to be the hardest hit, according to a new report.","The coal industry is expected to shed more than four lakh mining jobs, equivalent to nearly 100 workers per day, by 2035, even without climate pledges or policies to phase out coal, with China and India likely to be the hardest hit, according to a new report.
The primary reason will be the market shift toward cheaper wind and solar power generation and a lack of planning to manage a transition to a post-coal economy, said the report compiled by Global Energy Monitor, a US-based NGO that analyses the evolving international energy landscape.
The report suggests that 9,90,200 coal-mining jobs will cease to exist at operating mines given the foreseeable closures of coal facilities, potentially laying off more than one-third (37 per cent) of the existing workforce.
ADVERTISEMENT
China and India are expected to be the hardest hit. China’s Shanxi province would witness the largest number of job losses globally — 2,41,900 by 2050 — while Coal India is the producer facing the largest potential job cuts of 73,800 by the mid-century.
The report highlights that data shows 4,300 active and proposed coal mines and projects around the world are cumulatively responsible for more than 90 per cent of global coal production.
Climate commitments to phase out coal power generation could accelerate ongoing trends in coal-mining job losses, even as employment in renewable energy and construction now exceeds 50 per cent of total energy employment.
Coal-mining jobs play a significant role in remote coal regions, acting as anchors of economic activity and sustaining ancillary workforces and employment in local consumer and information economies.
ADVERTISEMENT
The vast majority of these workers are in Asia, with 22 lakh jobs in the region, and China and India are expected to bear the brunt of the coal-mine closures.
China has more than 15 lakh coal miners who produce over 85 per cent of its coal, accounting for half of the world’s output. Meanwhile, the northern provinces of Shanxi, Henan and Inner Mongolia mine more than a quarter of the world’s coal and employ 32 per cent of the global mining workforce, approximately 8,70,400 people.
India, the world’s second-largest coal producer, has a workforce approximately half the size of Shanxi. The country officially employs approximately 3,37,400 miners at its operating mines, although some studies suggest that the local mining sector has four “informal” employees for every one direct employee.
ADVERTISEMENT
State-owned Coal India faces the most potential layoffs of 73,800 direct workers by 2050, emphasising the importance of governments being involved in planning for coal worker transitions.
If countries and companies were to pursue plans to phase down coal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report suggests that only 2,52,200 miners would be necessary to maintain global coal production, given the current global average labour productivity of 337 workers for every 10 lakh tonnes of coal produced.
Global Energy Monitor finds that most mines expected to close in the coming decades have no planning underway to extend the life of those operations or manage a transition into a post-coal economy.
Dorothy Mei, project manager for the Global Coal Mine Tracker, stressed the importance of viable transition planning. “Coal mine closures are inevitable, but economic hardship and social strife for workers is not. Viable transition planning is happening, like in Spain, where the country regularly reviews the ongoing impacts of decarbonisation. Governments should draw inspiration from its success in planning their own just energy transition strategies.”
Ryan Driskell Tate, coal programme director, Global Energy Monitor, emphasised the need to prioritise workers. “We need to put workers first on the agenda if we want to make sure that just transition is not just talk. With technologies and markets primed for an energy transition, we have to be proactive about the unique concerns of coal miners and their communities.” Tiffany Means, researcher, noted the significance of government involvement.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The coal industry has a long list of mines that will close in the near term — many of them state-owned enterprises with a government stake. Governments need to shoulder their share of the burden to ensure a managed transition for those workers and communities as we move into a clean-energy economy.”
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the electricity sector emitted 12.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020, which is more than any other sector (36 per cent of all energy-related emissions).
ADVERTISEMENT
Coal remains the largest single source of electricity worldwide and is by far the largest source of electricity sector emissions, contributing just more than one-third of electricity supply but responsible for nearly three-quarters of electricity sector CO2 emissions.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global coal use needs to fall by 75 per cent by 2030, relative to the 2019 levels, to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era (1850-1900).
ADVERTISEMENT
At the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021, countries agreed to a phase-down of coal power and a phase-out of “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies — two key issues that had never been explicitly mentioned in the decisions of the UN climate talks before, despite coal, oil and gas being the main drivers of global warming.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/global-coal-industry-expected-layoff-4-lakh-miners-2035-report-8975871/,business

"GST Council to discuss on apportioning, renaming compensation cess beyond March 2026",Compensation cess was initially brought in for 5 years to make good the revenue shortfall of states following implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).,"The GST Council will decide on the modalities for appropriating the revenue collected by levying compensation cess on luxury, sin and demerit goods beyond March 2026, the deadline to repay loans taken by Centre to compensate states for revenue loss during Covid, an official said.
Compensation cess was initially brought in for 5 years to make good the revenue shortfall of states following implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The compensation cess expired in June 2022, but the amount collected through the levy is being used to repay the interest and principal of the Rs 2.69 lakh crore that the Centre had borrowed during Covid.
The GST Council will now have to take a call on the issue of ‘GST compensation cess’ with regard to its name, and the modalities for its distribution among the states.
ADVERTISEMENT
The issue was raised by some states at the 52nd GST Council meeting on October 7.
Chattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister T S Singh Deo said the issue was raised by Karnataka on ‘prospective planning’ for tax collected under the GST compensation cess account.
“After March 2026 what will happen to the cess amount? Now that there is no compensation, what will you do with the cess amount? Will there be cess or a cess with another name. Will it be for another purpose? How will you apportion it? Will the base be 2015-16 financial year or a new date? So the consensus of the House was also that if you are going to talk about it, we should talk about a new financial year (as base year),” Deo said.
In order to meet the resource gap of the states due to short release of compensation, the Centre borrowed and released Rs 1.1 lakh crore in 2020-21 and Rs 1.59 lakh crore in 2021-22 as back-to-back loans to meet a part of the shortfall in cess collection.

The Centre, in June last year, notified extension of the compensation cess, levied on luxury and demerit goods, till March 2026 to repay borrowing that were done in 2020-21 and 2021-22 to compensate states for GST revenue loss.
Finance Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman had on Saturday told reporters that the GST Council has agreed for a discussion on the way the cess can be renamed and can be appropriated between the Centre and states.
“The discussion (in the GST Council) was from the view of prospective planning, can the GST Council look at if there are ways in which cess or surcharge or something else can be used, if at all can be used how to use it,” Sitharaman had said.

GST was introduced from July 1, 2017, and states were assured of compensation for the revenue loss, till June 2022, arising on account of GST roll-out.
Though states’ protected revenue has been growing at 14 per cent compounded growth, the cess collection did not increase in the same proportion. COVID-19 further increased the gap between protected revenue and the actual revenue receipt including reduction in cess collection.
In order to meet the resource gap of the states due to short release of compensation, the Centre borrowed and released Rs 2.69 lakh crore in 2020-21 and 2021-22 as back-to-back loans to meet a part of the shortfall in cess collection.

"World Bank’s Banga faces pressure on resources, shareholder schisms","Ajay Banga, just 130 days into the job, has a mandate to broaden the multilateral development lender's mission to tackle global crises including climate change, pandemics and fragile states.","World Bank President Ajay Banga will come under pressure this week to focus on climate change, but the former Mastercard CEO first needs to get shareholders in line on how to grow the bank.
Banga, just 130 days into the job, has a mandate to broaden the multilateral development lender’s mission to tackle global crises including climate change, pandemics and fragile states.
But with annual climate transition finance needs estimated at up to $3 trillion for emerging market and low-income economies by 2030, development advocates are calling on him to make tackling global warming the priority at his first World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings.
ADVERTISEMENT
A G20-commissioned panel of experts recommended in July that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) increase annual lending by $260 billion, more than three times their current pace, to help meet climate needs.
“We’d love to shareholders see come out with a strong endorsement of that target and a plan to push that forward,” said Amy Dodd, development policy director at ONE Campaign.
Banga, however, has said the major step from the meetings in Morocco will be the long-awaited shareholder endorsement of modifying the bank’s anti-poverty mission statement.
The move to add “on a livable planet” has been in process for a year, and the development community is eager for next steps to maintain momentum and scale up financing quickly.
ADVERTISEMENT
The World Bank in April lowered its equity-to-loan ratio to boost lending by $50 billion over 10 years. But many further steps are more complicated and need countries to decide how much taxpayer funds they are willing to contribute or put at risk.
“I’m very skeptical that there’s going to be a big step forward on the size of the institution in Marrakech,” said Clemence Landers, a former U.S. Treasury official now with the Center for Global Development in Washington.
This group on Monday published a new scorecard for MDB reforms, saying that broad changes are “firmly in play” but progress in implementing them has been limited.
COMPLEX MOVES
ADVERTISEMENT
For now, the U.S. wants countries to back loan guarantees by the World Bank, with President Joe Biden pushing a request that Congress approve $2.1 billion in new funding that could unlock $25 billion in new concessional loans over a decade.
A World Bank report to be considered in Marrakech estimates that $10 billion in guarantee commitments could boost lending by $60 billion over that period.
But no other major shareholders have joined the U.S. move, which is viewed as a more palatable alternative for U.S. lawmakers to a general capital increase as this would likely lead to a bigger Chinese shareholding at the bank.
British officials have expressed support for a capital increase, but Germany has favored more issuance of hybrid capital, a debt-like instrument, that the World Bank estimates could add another $40 billion in new lending over a decade.
A bigger move would boost lending against the World Bank’s “callable capital,” a cushion of emergency funds pledged by shareholders but not paid-in, but this would require some countries to change laws.
ADVERTISEMENT
Banga has said the move is complex and will take time to negotiate. But the payoff could be huge, with the Rockefeller Foundation estimating a lending increase of some $900 billion over a decade if ratings agencies modified their evaluations.
A U.S. Treasury official told Reuters that the department is working to develop rules for callable capital so that decisions could be made by April 2024.
PLUMBING
ADVERTISEMENT
Banga has played down the lending increases and emphasized his efforts to make the 16,000-strong organization more nimble and focused on projects with measurable impacts, saying he wants “to fix the plumbing”.
Other World Bank presidents, including Jim Yong Kim, were unable to meaningfully reform the bank, which Banga has called “dysfunctional”, despite a talented and dedicated staff.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He is shaking things up,” said a senior official at the U.S. Treasury, which nominated him for the job.
While the Indian born American citizen’s approach has caused some internal friction, according to bank staff, Banga, 63, has received high marks for pushing the envelope.
“Banga had a good start,” said Michael Krake, who represents Germany on the World Bank’s executive board.

In a statement, the ad hoc bondholder group said it had not been given any documents or filings from Evergrande despite repeated requests.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Evergrande announced in late September that Chinese regulators said it would be unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main unit, throwing its offshore debt restructure plans into disarray.
The ad hoc group said it was urging the Chinese property developer, the mostly heavily indebted in the world, to seek a resolution from regulators to allow the restructuring to proceed.
“This is the only way the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the regulatory issues can be resolved,” the statement said.
“Until then, the base case is that China Evergrande Group will be liquidated at the next winding up hearing on October 30, 2023.”

Meredith Whittaker, the President of the Signal Foundation – which runs the eponymous messaging app – said that privacy is about power asymmetries, with governments and corporations trying to leverage intimate information they have about people. The messaging app is supported by the Signal Foundation, which relies on donations made by users for funds. In an interview with Soumyarendra Barik, she also spoke about how Signal responds to law enforcement agencies including in India, the hype around current AI platforms, attempts by big businesses to launch open source AI models and how Signal could help during Internet shutdowns. Edited excerpts:
We finally had a data protection law some weeks ago, but despite that, you see the notion of privacy having varying explanations in our society. Some say it is perhaps an elitist right, in that only the well to do people care about it. The reality is also that despite being the biggest democracy online, there are households where one digital device is shared by adults of different genders, and kids. How do you view India as a market for an app that’s solely focused on offering private communications?

Attack on Israel could boost appeal of gold and safe haven assets,"Rising geopolitical risk could see buying in assets like gold and the dollar and potentially boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, which have been sold off aggressively, analysts said.","Investors are closely watching events in Israel as a geopolitical risk to markets, with some expectation the violence could prompt a move into safe haven assets. Gunmen from the Palestinian group Hamas entered Israel in an unprecedented attack on Saturday. Western countries, led by the United States, denounced the attack and pledged support for Israel.
Rising geopolitical risk could see buying in assets like gold and the dollar and potentially boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, which have been sold off aggressively, analysts said. “This is a good example of why people need gold in their portfolios. It is a perfect hedge against international turmoil,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, who predicted the dollar would also benefit. “Anytime there is international turmoil, the dollar strengthens,” said Cardillo.
Markets have been reacting in recent weeks to an expectation that U.S. interest rates will stay higher for longer. Bond yields have soared while the U.S. dollar has been on a streak of gains. Stocks meanwhile had sharp losses for the third quarter but stabilised in the last week.

“Whether this is a massive market moment or not depends on how long it lasts and whether others are sucked into the conflict,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, of the situation in Israel.
Jacobsen questioned how much impact it would have on the oil price despite Iran having been boosting output.
ALSO READ | An attack from Gaza and an Israeli declaration of war. Now what?
The Hamas attack was openly praised by Iran and by Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese allies. “Iranian oil production has been increasing, but any progress they’ve been making behind the scenes with the U.S. will be dramatically undermined by Iran’s celebrating Hamas’s actions,” said Jacobsen, adding that “the possible output loss matters, but it won’t be earth shattering.”
“It’s most critical to see how Saudi Arabia reacts,” said Jacobsen. Washington has been trying to strike a deal that would normalise ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

"Inability to hike petrol, diesel prices ahead of 2024 LS polls to weaken OMCs’ profitability: Moody’s","Although petrol and diesel prices are deregulated, the three OMCs in the past have kept fuel prices frozen around key elections, particularly if the global rates dictated a price increase.","Given the volatility in international crude oil prices, Moody’s Investor Service expects the profitability of India’s oil marketing companies (OMCs) — Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) — to weaken if oil prices are at elevated levels as the three companies will have little room to pass on the higher costs to consumers in view of the impending 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
“The OMCs’ marketing margins — the difference between their net realised prices and international prices — have already weakened significantly from the high levels seen in the quarter ended 30 June 2023. Marketing margins on diesel turned negative since August while margins on petrol have narrowed considerably over the same period as international prices increased,” Moody’s said in a recent report. It added that to some extent, the slump in marketing margins has been mitigated by strong refining margins — the difference in the value of all refined products coming out of a refinery and the value of crude processed to derive those products.

‘Cautious optimism’: Experts welcome RBI’s move to continue with pause on repo rate hike,"BankBazaar CEO Adhil Shetty said, ""The RBI’s view is that developed economies are nearing a peaking of rates. This is welcome, although inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than anticipated.""","The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) move to continue with the pause on repo rate hikes in its October bimonthly policy meeting was welcomed by experts on Friday.
BankBazaar CEO Adhil Shetty said, “The RBI’s view is that developed economies are close to peaking of rates. This is welcomed, although inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than anticipated. We see cautious optimism in the governor’s speech. It suggests that things are difficult right now. But interest rates and inflation are on the right trajectory with limited upside risks, and the central bank will continue to manage growth expectations using all the tools of monetary policy.”
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das earlier in the day announced that the monetary policy committee (MPC) has unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. He said, “After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial developments and the outlook, RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided unanimously to keep the Policy Repo Rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent.”
ADVERTISEMENT
This is the fourth time that the committee has decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged. Before this, the MPC raised the repo rate by 250 basis points from May last year till April 2023.
Niraj Kumar, Chief Investment Officer, Future Generali India Life Insurance Company said, “MPC has delivered an in-line and balanced policy, with the overarching focus being maintaining the stability in policy stance, despite being clouded by the chaos in global rates market and commodities. While the MPC’s mention of the need for OMO sales has slightly spooked the markets in the interim, it’s imperative from liquidity standpoint, especially with Global bond index inclusion on the horizon.”
While announcing the monetary policy, Das said, “Macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth are the fundamental principles underlying our country’s progress. The policy mix that we have pursued during recent years of multiple and unparalleled shocks has fostered macroeconomic and financial stability.” He added, “The twin balance sheet stress that was encountered a decade ago has now been replaced by a twin balance sheet advantage with healthier balance sheets of both banks and corporates.”
The RBI governor said that the retail inflation in September is likely to ease, however, a fall in kharif sowing may pose a threat to it.
ADVERTISEMENT
India’s retail inflation in August eased to 6.83 per cent from a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July. But inflation continues to remain above the upper limit of RBI’s tolerance band.
Commenting on the MPC outcome, Mahesh Agarwal, National -Head Wealth at AUM Capital said, “The RBI’s decision to maintain the status quo has been needed for the market. Also, There is still a long way to go before inflation is brought into line with its targets.”
“Since inflation is a primary concern and growth is resilient, RBI seeks 4 per cent inflation. To avoid hyperinflation and a collapse of the rupee, this target is set to prevent the Indian economy from overheating. As a result, RBI will keep liquidity tight and yields are likely to be elevated. In addition to OMO sales, RBI will use these to control liquidity. It is therefore expected that yields and curves will be higher in the medium term,” Agarwal added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Piyush Baranwal, Senior Fund Manager (Fixed Income), WhiteOak Capital Asset Management Ltd said, “Status quo in today’s policy indicates MPC’s comfort with moderating trajectory for CPI and RBI is now using tighter liquidity including through OMO sales to accelerate transmission of past policy measures to drive inflation towards its 4 per cent target. As a side benefit, this should also help ward off pressure on the external front as global markets adjust to the ‘higher for longer’ rates and tighter financial conditions.”
Tribhuwan Adhikari, MD & CEO of LIC Housing Finance said, “RBI’s decision to maintain the repo rate unchanged in today’s MPC meeting is on expected lines. The move demonstrates RBI’s continued commitment to support growth and maintain economic stability. The steady interest rate environment will help us in keeping our offerings competitive and affordable. Overall, the move will improve the sentiments.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/experts-rbi-monetary-policy-repo-rate-hike-pause-8971285/,business

As the banker to the government, the RBI does not have any worry on the central government finances, Das said.
The “outlier” loan growth of 33 per cent as against the overall credit growth of 13-14 per cent made the RBI flag the issue of personal loans and prompt banks to take steps to avoid any risk build-up, Deputy Governor J Swaminathan said.

Global economy’s glide to ‘soft landing’ gets bumpy as bond yields jump,"The world's finance officials, who will gather in Morocco next week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, may disagree over the exact drivers of a global bond rout that now appears to reflect more than guessing how far central bankers will raise interest rates.","Rocketing U.S. government bond yields that have led to a global jump in borrowing costs are raising new risks for economic policymakers hoping to lower inflation without triggering a major crisis.
The world’s finance officials, who will gather in Morocco next week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, may disagree over the exact drivers of a global bond rout that now appears to reflect more than guessing how far central bankers will raise interest rates.
The cause – whether high government deficits, China’s suddenly turgid economy, or political dysfunction in the U.S. Congress – may be less important, though, than the implications for a world financial system that had seemed headed for a “soft landing” from the post-pandemic breakout of inflation.

Central banks around the world approved rapid-fire interest rate increases in response to rising prices, and officials throughout the policy tightening welcomed the largely smooth adjustment in global financial conditions as a testament to better monetary and fiscal management across many countries.
But after what was deemed “a summer of resilience,” Goldman Sachs economists said “cracks” are appearing as emerging market sovereign bonds come under pressure on the heels of rising yields on U.S. Treasuries, the world’s risk-free benchmark that draws money from other investments as interest rates rise.
The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond this week pierced 5% for the first time since 2007. While it was routinely above that level through the first years of this century, analysts say the speed of its rise is noteworthy, particularly as it occurred even as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have signaled their own rate hikes are near an end.
“There should be concern less about the level and more about the pace of change,” said Gene Tannuzzo, global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle.

Long-term U.S. yields have climbed roughly 1 percentage point in the past three months compared with a single quarter-percentage-point Fed rate hike during that period. “That is a rate of change that cannot be sustained, and if we continue to move in that direction, then we would need to see action from the Fed” to blunt the impact, Tannuzzo said.
SPILLOVER RISK
The IMF and World Bank meetings are a chance to take stock of the state of the global economy, and are accompanied by signature reports on the world economic outlook and the state of global financial markets.
Inflation and the impact of tighter monetary policy have been focal points since prices began a sharp climb in 2021. The IMF’s last Global Financial Stability Report, issued in April, showed risks to the financial system were top of mind after several high-profile U.S. bank failures in the prior month.
ADVERTISEMENT
But that moment passed without any broader contagion, and the outlook turned steadily brighter from there, particularly in the U.S.: The prospect of continued economic growth alongside falling inflation – the so-called soft-landing scenario – went from a history-defying aspiration to, in effect, the Fed’s baseline.
That sort of best-case outcome would have positive global repercussions. Keeping the world’s largest economy out of recession provides steadier demand for other countries’ exports, as well as more certainty as Fed rate hikes hit a stopping point.
The fast moves in financial markets, however, could prove destabilizing, with the impact felt through rising bond yields, a stronger dollar, and, if sustained, renewed inflation pressures in other countries.
“There are effects that could happen if you create budget strains in other countries or ultimately budget crises in other countries. I think that is something that the Fed needs to be watching,” Karen Dynan, an economics professor at Harvard University, said during a presentation last week at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Those sorts of crises could spill over into broader financial markets and then pose a real threat to our economy.”
Fed officials don’t see that yet.
In comments earlier this week, a number of Fed regional bank presidents saw the activity in the Treasuries market as in line with what would be expected from the central bank’s rate increases, saying it has not had the sort of outsized impact on consumer or business spending that would warrant worrying whether policymakers had gone too far with the rate hikes.
UNANTICIPATED TIGHTENING

But the jump in yields also demonstrates some of the vagaries of central banking that officials are likely to try to puzzle through next week.
Global growth, particularly in light of China’s current weakness, already is expected to slow. After the massive worldwide fiscal response to the coronavirus pandemic, many national budgets may be too stretched to respond forcefully to a currency crisis or financial instability sparked by dollar-driven shifts in capital flows.
ADVERTISEMENT
Institutions like the Fed can control an overnight interest rate designed to set rates for other types of securities. But markets influenced by macroeconomic views, the outlook for inflation, and factors like political risks ultimately determine the borrowing costs footed by governments, companies and households.
It is those rates that can propel or depress an economy, and feed or stifle inflation. The issue before policymakers is whether the recent market moves have gone beyond what is needed to tame inflation and created unwanted risks to growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
So far, the moves do not suggest a burgeoning crisis, economists at Capital Economics wrote this week, saying comparisons to last year’s upheaval over U.K. government bond yields or the market illiquidity seen at the start of the coronavirus pandemic are overblown.
But it’s also the type of environment that could “morph into something more serious” if bond losses push a key institution towards insolvency, as happened at California-based Silicon Valley Bank in March, or erodes confidence to the point where holders of securities start selling at fire-sale prices, they wrote.
The fallout depends on “how much further, and how quickly, bond yields rise,” they said. “The big risk stems from an unanticipated tightening of financial conditions” that would strain government, household and business budgets alike, translate into bank stress, and reverse economic growth.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/global-economy-glide-soft-landing-bumpy-bond-yields-jump-8970800/,business

And already lots of people say, oh that’s a given. We will at any cost be third largest. You don’t need to take any credit for it. It’s not the current government which is keen to take credit for it, it’s actually the people of India who should feel that they should get credit and feel proud about it… to say it is a fait accompli, therefore, there’s no effort of the people of India, is to undermine the importance of entrepreneurs, farmers, and the struggling and economically weaker sections of India…,” she told students of the Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC).

According to the information provided by IndiGo, the fuel charge will be based on distance slabs and will vary between Rs 300 and Rs 1,000 per sector.
“The decision follows the significant increase in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, which have surged in the last three months with consecutive price hikes every month. ATF accounts for a substantial portion of an airline’s operating expenses, necessitating fare adjustment to address such a cost surge. Under this pricing structure, passengers booking IndiGo flights will incur a fuel charge, per sector, based on the sector distance,” the carrier said in a statement.

RBI MPC expected to retain benchmark rate: Experts,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) started its three-day meeting on Wednesday, and the policy review will be announced on Friday morning.","The RBI is expected to retain the benchmark rate of 6.5 per cent in its latest bi-monthly monetary policy review, amid inflation concerns and other global factors, experts said.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) started its three-day meeting on Wednesday, and the policy review will be announced on Friday morning.
“I think that between the last MPC meeting in August and this time, inflation has gone up, growth remains strong while global factors have turned a little adverse in the sense that the US Federal Reserve is still aggressive in its stance, which has led to hardening of yields. In this situation, the central bank is expected to maintain a status quo on policy rates in the ensuing policy,” Crisil Chief Economist D Joshi told PTI.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the RBI would focus more on inflation given that growth is strong right now, adding oil price movements need to be watched carefully, too.
“We believe that the interest rates will be on the higher side, which essentially means that we will not see any rate cut this fiscal year,” Joshi said.
The Reserve Bank has been mandated by the central government to ensure the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation remains at 4 per cent, with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.
Retail inflation jumped to a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July, as prices of vegetables and other food items spiked, according to official data.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chief Economist of Bandhan Bank, Siddhartha Sanyal, said, “The global macroeconomic backdrop remains complicated with uncertainties around growth. This will prompt the MPC to stay watchful, with a likely guidance of rates to remain higher for longer.
“Nevertheless, softening in prices of agro commodities since August has offered the MPC some breathing space, which will allow it to refrain from any rate action at the moment.”
Founder and Director of CreditWise Capital Aalesh Avlani also said there will likely be no change in the policy rates on Friday.
ADVERTISEMENT
The RBI started increasing the policy rate in May 2022 in tranches, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war and took it to 6.5 per cent in February this year. Since then, it has kept the rate unchanged in the last three successive bi-monthly monetary policy reviews.
Vice-Chairman and MD of Titagarh Rail Systems, Umesh Chowdhury, added: “The government’s policies and capital spending have certainly fuelled infrastructure growth. There are a lot of opportunities for the manufacturing sector, which means the private sector would have to incur capital expenditure. For that, the interest rate regime would continue to play a very important role”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-mpc-expected-retain-benchmark-rate-experts-8969840/,business
Evergrande crisis tests Beijing’s fallout management as creditor jitters mount,"As developer China Evergrande Group lurched from one crisis to another over the past two years, Beijing avoided directly intervening to rescue what was not too long ago considered one of the country's ""too big to fail"" enterprises.","As developer China Evergrande Group lurched from one crisis to another over the past two years, Beijing avoided directly intervening to rescue what was not too long ago considered one of the country’s “too big to fail” enterprises.
With the world’s most indebted developer now standing at the precipice after authorities launched a criminal investigation into its billionaire founder, some creditors, investors and analysts are now betting on authorities stepping in to manage the fallout.
A messy collapse of the property giant could rip through the already-sputtering economy, with hundreds of thousands of unfinished homes across the country and roughly $300 billion worth of liabilities at home in China alone.
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite a growing number of Chinese property developers having defaulted on debt obligations since a liquidity crisis hit the sector in 2021, Beijing has not directly stepped in to bail out any firm so far.
The prospects of Evergrande’s offshore debt restructuring plan, key to its survival, as well as its overall business have been clouded by the criminal investigation into founder and chairman Hui Ka Yan.
The probe suggests debt revamp efforts led by Hui have been rejected by the central government, which will now step in to take control and formulate new plans, said Xin Sun, senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian Business at King’s College London.
“The (investigation into Hui) clearly shows that Chinese policymakers prioritise political considerations to economic ones in dealing with Evergrande,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“From a political perspective, the government needs to ensure the company and its owners paying a heavy price for causing China’s real estate crisis and facing due punishment. Any restructuring can only happen after this political responsibility being taken.”
Evergrande has contract liabilities – payments made in advance from homebuyers – of 604 billion yuan ($83 billion), which is equivalent to around 600,000 housing units, according to a Gavekal Dragonomics report.
Beijing has made the completion and delivery of homes a top priority after the proliferation of unfinished apartments across the country sparked unprecedented collective disobedience in June last year.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The government’s priority will clearly be to deliver unsold and unfinished housing to homebuyers,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, referring to the Evergrande situation.
“You don’t need a formal government takeover, or even a SOE white-knight investor, for the government to start exerting massive influence over the company’s decisions, or for the entire industry to become more state-owned.”
Evergrande and China’s housing authority did not immediately respond to requests for comment during the week long National Day holiday.
EVERGRANDE RESTRUCTURING
Even before the probe into Hui was made public, Evergrande’s debt restructuring plan was clouded by its disclosure that it was unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main China unit.
Late last month, it also said it would have to reassess the terms of the proposed restructuring as home sales were not meeting expectations.
ADVERTISEMENT
“For all of the restructuring … issuance of new notes to an extension is a core part, so I don’t know how you can get it done without that,” said Sandra Chow, co-head of Asia-Pacific research at CreditSights.
Gavekal in its report said that at the very least, an orderly restructuring of Evergrande seemed increasingly hard to achieve. A liquidation petition filed against Evergrande is scheduled for hearing in a Hong Kong court on Oct 30.
ADVERTISEMENT
A person close to Evergrande, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the debt restructuring would be delayed but could still go ahead with guidance from a government-appointed risk management committee.
As the liquidity crisis snowballed at Evergrande in 2021, a risk-management committee was established at the company in December which included officials from state companies to assist in its debt and asset restructuring.
ADVERTISEMENT
An Evergrande bondholder, who also declined to be named, however, said restructuring efforts were set to be derailed by the Hui investigation and the developer could be liquidated even after government intervention.
But there is no clarity on how potentially one of the biggest liquidation exercises globally will play out and what will happen to creditors, especially offshore, as well as suppliers and homebuyers awaiting delivery of apartments.
Of its total liabilities worth $327 billion at the end of June, Evergrande has been in the process of seeking creditors’ approval for restructuring offshore debt worth $31.7 billion, which includes bonds, collateral, and repurchase obligations.
Because of the massive debt pile, worsening cash flow, and the scale of unfinished homes, some analysts wonder whether Evergrande has now morphed from too-big-to-fail to too-complicated-to-exist.
“Evergrande is large enough that its collapse needs to be managed. Partly because of size, (and) partly because of managing expectations,” said Antonio Fatas, INSEAD professor of economics.
In China, “because of the political/economic system and because of the large interference of the government and state-owned enterprises…there will always be a political question on how to share the losses associated with events like this one.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/evergrande-crisis-tests-beijing-fallout-management-8969739/,business

Ofcom said its study identified features that made it more difficult for UK businesses to use multiple cloud suppliers.
“The CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) will now conduct an independent investigation to decide whether there is an adverse effect on competition, and if so, whether it should take action or recommend others to take action,” Ofcom said.

Ofcom, which started looking into cloud services last year, had said in April it was particularly worried about the practices of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft because of their market positions, and it planned to ask the competition regulator to investigate.
Reuters on Tuesday reported that the regulator was expected to push for an antitrust investigation.
UK businesses told Ofcom they were concerned about it being too difficult to switch or mix and match cloud provider.
“So, we’re referring the market to the CMA for further scrutiny, to make sure business customers continue to benefit from cloud services,” said Fergal Farragher, Ofcom’s Director responsible for the Market Study.

That bodes well for Asia’s third-largest economy, which is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy this fiscal year, defying a global slowdown trend.
S&P Global’s India services purchasing managers’ index rose to 61.0 last month from 60.1 in August, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 59.5.
ADVERTISEMENT
The reading was above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a 26th consecutive month.
“The latest PMI results brought more positive news for India’s service economy, with September seeing business activity and new work intakes rising to one of the greatest extents in over 13 years,” noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global.
“Besides demand strength domestically, firms noted higher international sales to Asia, Europe and North America.”
While the new business sub-index – a key gauge of demand – rose slightly to 61.2 last month, export growth eased to the slowest pace since June but remained in expansionary territory for an eighth consecutive month.
ADVERTISEMENT
That improved business sentiment about the coming 12 months to its highest since June 2014. Job creation also stayed solid, with firms continuing to hire for a 16th straight month.
In an indication that a recent rebound in inflation could be transitory, input prices rose at the slowest pace since March and the prices charged index eased to a six-month low as companies refrained from raising fees too sharply to try and gain new customers.
“News on prices was also encouraging. Services charges rose at a softer rate as cost pressures receded to one of the lowest in two-and-a-half years,” added De Lima.

“Although the latter indicates that near-term output price inflation may cool, worries about potential fluctuations in food prices due to El Nino means the RBI is highly unlikely to cut rates until early next year.”
The Reserve Bank of India will keep its interest rate on hold at 6.50% until at least April before making a quarter-point cut in the second quarter, a recent Reuters poll found, around the time when global peers are also expected to start easing monetary policies.

"35% of investment advisors still not registered, says SEBI Chairperson","“We require investment advisors to register...There are a large number, some 35 per cent of investment advisors, still not registered,” Buch said at an event organised by the Association of Registered Investment Advisers (ARIA).","Despite a simple registration process, around 35 per cent of investment advisers are still not registered with the regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Wednesday.
She sought industry associations’ help in getting more advisers to get registered with the regulator.
“We require investment advisors to register…There are a large number, some 35 per cent of investment advisors, still not registered,” Buch said at an event organised by the Association of Registered Investment Advisers (ARIA).

“…It’s your profession, it is your livelihood, and in all this time, forget other compliances, you have not found time or inclination to come and register,” the SEBI Chairperson said.
As per the SEBI website, there are 1,314 registered investment advisers. However, to operate as registered investment advisers (RIAs), these entities have to register with BSE Administration and Supervision Ltd (BASL), a wholly owned subsidiary of BSE, which has been granted approval from SEBI for administration and supervision of Investment Advisers (IAs). At present, there are around 900 BASL registered members.
Buch asked ARIA to encourage more numbers of investment advisors to become registered entities.
“You (industry associations) are there all over the country. You have presence and people who care about the (investment adviser) community and who spend their time, effort and energy actually working for the community. We really need your assistance starting from something as simple as getting registered,” she said.

The capital markets regulator has been tightening the noose on unregistered and unauthorized investment advisers, including financial influencers, also known as finfluencers, who provide stock specific tips or advice on various social media platforms such as YouTube, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also asked people to exercise caution while following the advice of finfluencers.
The regulator is working on guidelines for finfluencers, and has announced advertisement guidelines to stop misleading advertising by investment advisers (IA) and research analysts (RA). In August this year, SEBI floated a consultation paper proposing a set of measures to restrict the association of regulated entities or intermediaries with unregistered finfluencers.

Buch said that industry associations should be more proactive in informing the regulator about the malpractices in the market. According to her, regulations can’t be made sitting in some ivory tower and the regulator needs to be in touch with the market. The only way for this is through feedback from industry associations and their members.
“We need good guys to come and tell us what are the malpractices in the market. We want them to help us craft solutions to address those so that good guys win. We want a million investment advisors,” SEBI chairperson said.
She said in order to validate claims of performance made by registered investment advisers, the regulator has come out with a consultation paper on the creation of a Performance Validation Agency (PVA).
“There will be an institutional mechanism where you (investment advisers) come to validate claims, and then you can make that claim,” Buch said.
She further said that SEBI is open to a segmented approach while formulating regulations for different segments.

“If there are distinct segments in the market then they must be regulated differently. Therefore, we are completely open and willing to look at a segmented approach to regulation,” SEBI Chairperson said.

Shell hikes diesel prices by Rs 20 a litre,"Shell India has hiked diesel prices by as much as Rs 20 per litre in less than a week's time, but the dominant public sector fuel retailers continue to keep rates on freeze for a record 18th month in a row.","Shell India has hiked diesel prices by as much as Rs 20 per litre in less than a week’s time, but the dominant public sector fuel retailers continue to keep rates on freeze for a record 18th month in a row.
With international oil prices hovering around USD 90 per barrel, the India unit of the world’s second-largest oil and gas company last week started raising fuel prices by Rs 4 per litre every day, company dealers and industry sources said.
The result is Shell India, whose 346 petrol pumps are mostly concentrated in the southern and western states, is now selling diesel at Rs 130 per litre in Mumbai and Rs 129 in Chennai.
Petrol at Shell bunks costs Rs 117-118 a litre.
ADVERTISEMENT
This compares to a price of Rs 106.31 a litre for petrol at public sector company’s petrol pumps in Mumbai and Rs 102.63 in Chennai. Diesel at PSU pumps costs Rs 94.27 a litre in Mumbai and Rs 94.24 in Chennai.
In Bengaluru, Shell is selling diesel for Rs 122 as compared to Rs 87.92 a litre rate at petrol pumps owned by public sector firms and Rs 87.99 per price at Reliance-BP bunks.
Dealers said a Rs 4 a litre hike is in offing in diesel prices at Shell pumps on Thursday as well and rates will continue at that level for the remainder of October. Diesel price in Mumbai will hit Rs 134 a litre on Thursday.
Shell does not own an oil refinery, which converts crude oil extracted from below ground or seabed into fuels like petrol and diesel, in the country. It sources products and market prices and has revised rates to reflect a surge in international oil prices since August.
ADVERTISEMENT
Reached for comments, a company spokesperson said: “Shell India confirms price increase in diesel. We understand our customers’ concerns; however, we have decided to increase the diesel prices due to the volatile market conditions.” “Our pricing depends on various factors, such as government taxes and duties, distribution costs, and operational expenses. We strive to give our customers the best value possible: providing high-quality fuels to help enhance engine performance and efficiency,” the spokesperson said.
State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) own 79,204 out of 87,677 petrol pumps in the country. Russia’s Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy is the largest private fuel retailer with 6,422 bunks while Reliance-BP has 1,633. Shell has 346 pumps.
Nayara, which owns a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, has so far not made any major price changes. Reliance too owns refineries in Gujarat.

Sources said international oil prices had moderated in May/June this year, helping oil companies make handsome profits at the capped retail prices.
However, global rates started firming up in July and have turned margins negative. The basket of crude oil that India buys averaged close to USD 75 a litre in May and June but rose to USD 80.37 in July and USD 86.43 in August. In September, it averaged USD 93.54 per barrel and the average for this month is USD 92.72.
According to brokerage Nomura, state-owned fuel retailers lost Rs 7 per litre at the current retail prices.
International oil prices have been turbulent in the last couple of years. It dipped into the negative zone at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and swung wildly in 2022 — climbing to a 14-year high of nearly USD 140 per barrel in March 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, before sliding on weaker demand from top importer China and worries of an economic contraction.
But for a nation that is 85 per cent dependent on imports, the spike meant adding to already firming inflation and derailing the economic recovery from the pandemic.
ADVERTISEMENT
IOC, BPCL and HPCL, which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, temporarily abandoned the daily price revision in late 2021 and have not revised petrol and diesel prices in line with the cost. They stopped daily price revision in early November 2021 when rates across the country hit an all-time high, prompting the government to roll back a part of the excise duty hike it had effected during the pandemic to take advantage of low oil prices.
The freeze continued into 2022 but the war-led spike in international oil prices prompted a Rs 10 a litre hike in petrol and diesel prices from mid-March before another round of excise duty cut rolled back all of the Rs 13 a litre and Rs 16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected during the pandemic.

That followed the current price freeze that began on April 6, which still continues.
Holding prices when input cost was higher than retail selling prices led to the three firms posting net earnings loss. They posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September 2022 despite accounting for Rs 22,000 crore announced but not paid LPG subsidy.

TikTok ends retail business in Indonesia after ban on social media shopping,The Chinese-owned video sharing app said in a statement it will stop facilitating e-commerce sales in TikTok Shop Indonesia by 5 pm Wednesday.,"TikTok said it will halt its online retail operation in Indonesia on Wednesday to comply with the country’s decision to ban e-commerce transactions on social media platforms — a big blow to the video platform’s fastest-growing market.
The Indonesian government announced the new regulation, which prohibits social media companies from facilitating sales of products on their platforms, on Sept 28 in a bid to protect small businesses from e-commerce competition, accusing the popular apps and websites of predatory pricing.
The Chinese-owned video sharing app said in a statement it will stop facilitating e-commerce sales in TikTok Shop Indonesia by 5 pm Wednesday.

“Our priority is to remain compliant with local laws and regulations,” said the statement released Tuesday on its website.
Indonesia’s Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan said the ban aims to “prevent the domination of the algorithm and prevent the use of personal data in business interests” and “create a fair, healthy and beneficial electronic commerce ecosystem,” according to a statement released by the Trade Ministry when the ban was announced. It said marketplaces and sellers can only offer or promote goods and services.
A week before the ban was announced, Southeast Asia’s largest wholesale market, Tanah Abang, came under inspection.
Know More | Which countries have banned TikTok and why
Sellers at the market in the capital, Jakarta, were experiencing a more than 50% loss of profits because they could not compete with imported products sold online at much lower prices, according to Minister of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Teten Masduki.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said TikTok was involved in predatory pricing that caused damages to local small- and medium-sized businesses, and that the new regulation “will justly regulate fair trade online and offline”.
Days after the ban was announced, TikTok Indonesia said it regretted the government’s decision — particularly the impact it would have on the millions of sellers who use TikTok Shop. But the company said it will respect the regulations and “will take a constructive path forward”.
Southeast Asia, a region home to more than 675 million people, is one of TikTok’s biggest markets in terms of user numbers, generating more than 325 million visitors to the app every month.

TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, is also facing scrutiny from some governments and regulators because of concerns that Beijing could use the app to harvest user data or advance its interests.
Countries including the United States, Britain and New Zealand have banned the app on government phones, despite TikTok repeatedly denying that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/tiktok-ends-retail-business-indonesia-ban-social-media-shopping-8968127/,business
Govt hikes LPG subsidy for Ujjwala beneficiaries by 50% to Rs 300 per cylinder,"With Wednesday’s decision, a 14.2-kg domestic LPG cylinder in Delhi will effectively cost Rs 603 for PMUY beneficiaries, while for other domestic consumers, it will continue to be priced at Rs 903.","In the run-up to Assembly polls in five states later this year and Lok Sabha elections in 2024, the government on Wednesday increased the cooking gas subsidy for poor households under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) by Rs 100 per 14.2-kg cylinder to Rs 300. The decision is expected to benefit 9.6 crore households that are currently covered under the targetted subsidy scheme.
The decision, which was announced by Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur after Wednesday’s meeting of the Union Cabinet, comes around a month after the government announced a price cut of Rs 200 per cylinder for all domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LGP) consumers including PMUY beneficiaries, and expanded the PMUY coverage to cover another 75 lakh poor households over three years.

RBI’s rate-setting panel starts deliberations amid expectation of status quo,The monetary policy review will be announced on Friday morning by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das.,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) started its three-day meeting on Wednesday amid expectations of a status quo on the rate front in its bi-monthly monetary policy review.
The policy review will be announced on Friday morning.
In case of a status quo, interest rates for retail, as well as corporate borrowers, would remain stable. Experts believe that the Reserve Bank will retain the benchmark rate at 6.5 per cent in view of the elevated inflation and global factors.
The Reserve Bank started increasing the policy rate in May 2022 in tranches, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war and took it to 6.5 per cent in February this year. Since then, it has kept the rate unchanged in the last three successive bi-monthly monetary policy reviews.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The credit policy this time will most likely continue with the existing rate structure as well as policy stance. Hence, the repo rate will be retained at 6.5 per cent with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation,” opined Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda.
He further said retail inflation is still high at 6.8 per cent and expected to come down sharply in September and October, but there is still some pessimism on Kharif output especially relating to pulses which has the potential to push up prices further.
“But as the inflation trajectory is downwards, a rate hike can be ruled out. However, we may have to wait for a longer time for the MPC to cut the repo rate,” he said.
“With inflation still remaining high, a reduction in policy rate looks remote, but in the interest of MSMEs and the economy as a whole, we expect the RBI to maintain the status quo as any further increase will start hurting the growth of the economy,” Puneet Kaura, chairman, CII Delhi State Council and MD & CEO, Samtel Avionics said.

Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President & Group Head – Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA also expects the MPC to maintain status quo on the policy rate as well as the stance.
“The significant tightening in liquidity that was seen in the second half of September is unlikely to sustain, particularly with the release of liquidity from incremental CRR imposed in previous policy,” he said.
He further said, RBI is likely to remain cautious on sharp rise in interest rates in developing economies since the last policy review and the impact it may have on the capital flows, forex reserves and the exchange rate as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Reserve Bank has been mandated by the government to ensure the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation remains at 4 per cent, with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.
President of realtors’ body association NAREDCO Rajan Bandelkar said RBI’s accommodative stance is expected to persist during the October MPC meeting.
“While there has been a lengthy pause (on repo rate), there is a pressing need to shift our attention towards the real estate sector, especially during the ongoing festive season. Positive actions by the RBI at this juncture could play a pivotal role in achieving our housing targets,” he said.
The borrowing cost which started rising in May last year has stabilised with RBI keeping the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February, when it was raised from 6.25 per cent. Later in the next three bi-monthly policy reviews in April, June and August the benchmark rate was retained.
Parijat Agrawal, head-fixed income, Union Asset Management Company, said the headline inflation is expected to cool down in September as compared to August, but it still remains above RBI’s comfort zone.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The recent spike in crude oil prices and global bond yields shall keep MPC vigilant on inflation-growth dynamics. The MPC is expected to maintain the status quo on rates and stance at the upcoming October meeting,” Agrawal said.
The MPC is entrusted with the responsibility of deciding the policy repo rate with the objective of achieving the inflation target, keeping in mind the objective of growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
In an off-cycle meeting in May 2022, the MPC raised the policy rate by 40 basis points and it was followed by rate hikes of varying sizes, in each of the five subsequent meetings till February 2023. The repo rate was raised by 250 basis points cumulatively between May 2022 and February 2023.
The MPC consists of three external members and three officials of the RBI. The external members on the panel are Shashanka Bhide, Ashima Goyal, and Jayanth R Varma. Besides Governor Das, the other RBI officials in MPC are Rajiv Ranjan (Executive Director) and Michael Debabrata Patra (Deputy Governor).",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/reserve-bank-rate-setting-panel-starts-deliberations-amid-expectation-status-quo-8968109/,business

Along with fears that interest rates will stay high for some time, oil benchmarks also have been pressured by concerns that the strengthening dollar would dent demand, as it makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Indian economy likely to grow at 6.3% in FY24: World Bank,"With inflation expected to remain sticky, the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI, which will begin its meeting from Wednesday, is expected to keep the repo rate unchanged.","The Indian economy is estimated to grow at 6.3 per cent in the current financial year 2023-24, showing resilience despite elevated inflation and global headwinds, the World Bank said in its India Development Update released Tuesday. Though the growth estimate by the Bank has been retained from its earlier update in April, it is 20 basis points lower than the 6.5 per cent growth estimate both by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for FY24.
The World Bank, however, raised the inflation forecast for FY24 to 5.9 per cent from 5.2 per cent in its April update, citing risks from the monsoon deficiency and its evolving impact on prices, El Niño phenomena, and global supply chain disruptions. With inflation expected to remain sticky, the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI, which will begin its meeting from Wednesday, is expected to keep the repo rate unchanged.

"E-gaming cos look to absorb GST through cashbacks, bonuses","Fearing that passing on the GST deduction on deposits to their wallets could result in a loss of customers, many online gaming companies have decided to foot the bill for “as long as possible”, a senior gaming company executive told The Indian Express.","Even as the industry deals with the fallout of the new goods and service tax (GST), online gaming companies have come up with a new idea to avoid losing customers – by absorbing the GST deduction and compensating users for it for at least the next two to three years.
The move comes after amended legal provisions and rules for online gaming, horse racing and casinos kicked in from October 1, bringing into effect the 28 per cent tax at face value at entry level under the GST regime.

"Oil minister Puri urges OPEC to be pragmatic, make global crude prices affordable","Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday urged oil producers’ cartel OPEC to “imbue a sense of pragmatism, balance and affordability in the oil markets”.","Highlighting the rise in crude oil prices due to production cuts by major oil producers and its adverse impact on major oil consuming nations, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday urged oil producers’ cartel OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) to “imbue a sense of pragmatism, balance and affordability in the oil markets”. According to an official statement, Puri held talks with OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al-Ghais in Abu Dhabi and called for “balancing global energy markets by ensuring that crude oil prices do not outstrip the paying ability of the consuming countries”.
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement. Given the country’s extremely high import dependency, India’s economy is sensitive to oil price volatility. Apart from inflationary pressures, high oil prices could have implications for India’s trade balance, foreign exchange reserves, the rupee, and the overall health of the economy.

States’ borrowing cost soars to 23-week high of 7.56 pc,"On an annualised basis to the week, the states have drawn down 15.4 per cent more than what they had drawn in the same period last fiscal at Rs 19,500 crore.","States’ borrowing cost jumped 10 basis points to 7.56 per cent at the first weekly debt auction of the third quarter on Tuesday and is the highest in the the past 23 weeks.
Fourteen states raised Rs 22,500 crore through the issuance of state government securities in line with the indicated amount for this weekly auction for the third quarter calendar.
According to Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at Icra Ratings, the auctions saw a steep increase in the cut-offs across tenors leading to the weighted average cost jumping to a 23-week high of 7.56 per cent. It stood at 7.46 percent last week.

The new framework will come into effect from January 1, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.

Sebi said that listed companies wishing to provide beneficial access to such a centralized mechanism to their investors holding securities in physical form can establish connectivity with KRA through their RTAs.
After receiving intimation about the demise of an investor, the concerned intermediary will have to obtain the death certificate along with the PAN from the notifier or nominee and verify the death certificate through online or offline mode.
If the concerned intermediary, after receiving information about the demise of the investor from the notifier or nominee, is not in a position to obtain the death certificate, then it will have to inform the nominee that the KYC status of the deceased investor has been flagged off as “On Hold” and require them to furnish the death certificate of the concerned investor.
After verification of the death certificate, the concerned intermediary will have to, on the same day of verification, submit a KYC modification request to the KRA that “information on death of investor received; death certificate verified” and also upload the relevant documents. Besides, the intermediary will have to block all debit transactions in the account or folios of the deceased investor.
ADVERTISEMENT
In case the death certificate is not received, the concerned intermediary will have to, by the next working day of the intimation, submit a KYC modification request in the KRA system — “information on death of investor received; confirmation awaited”.
Spelling out the obligations of the KRA, Sebi said that KRA, following the receipt of a KYC modification request from the intermediary will carry out an independent verification by the next working day of receipt of such request.
Following the validation of the death certificate, the KRA will have to update the KYC record as ‘blocked permanently’ in the system and intimate this updation to all linked intermediaries.

In order to have uniformity for operationalising the mechanism, Sebi asked stock exchanges, depositories and industry associations like the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), Registrars Association of India (RAIN), in consultation with stakeholders, including KRAs, to put in place common SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).

Russian rouble weakens past 100 to US dollar,"The Russian rouble weakened past the symbolic threshold of 100 to the dollar before recovering slightly in early trade on Tuesday, weighed down by foreign currency outflows and the country's shrinking current account surplus.","The Russian rouble weakened past the symbolic threshold of 100 to the dollar before recovering slightly in early trade on Tuesday, weighed down by foreign currency outflows and the country’s shrinking current account surplus.
The rouble’s last tumble into triple digits in August led the Bank of Russia to make an emergency 350-basis-point rate hike to 12% and authorities discussed reintroducing controls to buttress the currency.
At 0415 GMT, the rouble was 0.21% weaker against the dollar at 99.97 after falling to as low as 100.26 soon after opening at 0400 GMT.
ADVERTISEMENT
It had gained 0.33% to trade at 104.61 versus the euro . It had shed 0.28% against the yuan to 13.65 .
The Russian currency tends to come under pressure at the start of each month, after losing the support of a favourable month-end tax period that usually sees exporters convert FX revenues to meet local liabilities.
President Vladimir Putin’s economic adviser rebuked the central bank as the rouble slid to 101.75 per dollar in August, blaming its loose policy in a sign of growing internal discord.
Following the August emergency hike, the central bank raised rates again in September to 13%. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank, also grappling with stubborn inflationary pressure, to tighten monetary policy again at its next scheduled meeting on Oct. 27.
ADVERTISEMENT
The rouble has charted a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenue.
Falling exports, hit by Western sanctions and shifting trade flows, combined with a recovery in imports this year has caused the rouble to weaken. Russia’s current account surplus shrank 86% year-on-year to $25.6 billion in January-August.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/world-market/russian-rouble-weakens-past-100-against-us-dollar-8966256/,business
India’s manufacturing PMI growth eases to 57.5 in September,"India's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 57.5 last month from 58.6 in August, missing the Reuters poll forecast for 58.1.","India’s factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in five months in September but remained solid, with strong demand driving business confidence to its highest level this year, despite increased inflationary pressures, a private survey showed.
The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 57.5 last month from 58.6 in August, missing the Reuters poll forecast for 58.1.
That marked the 27th straight month of the index being above the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction.
ADVERTISEMENT
“India’s manufacturing industry showed mild signs of a slowdown in September, primarily due to a softer increase in new orders which tempered production growth,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“Nevertheless, both demand and output saw significant upticks, and firms also noted gains in new business from clients across Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East.”
New orders and output rose sharply despite the sub-indexes easing from August, driven by both domestic and foreign demand. International demand grew for the 18th month in a row.
That bolstered optimism and pushed business confidence to a nine-month high.
ADVERTISEMENT
It also prompted firms to increase headcount. The employment index was the highest since November and has been above 50 for six consecutive months although the rate of expansion remained moderate.
Input costs rose mildly in September – at the weakest pace in over three years – as participants noted lower prices for aluminium and oil.
However, strong demand spurred companies to raise their selling prices. The output charges index rose, driven by higher labour costs, and the rate of increase was above its long-run average, indicating more inflation worries.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The solid increase in output charges signalled by the PMI data, which occurred in spite of a notable retreat in cost pressures, could restrict sales in the coming months,” added De Lima.
Inflation in India eased in August to 6.83% from July’s 15-month high of 7.44% but remained above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target range of 2%-6%, keeping policymakers watchful.
The RBI was not expected to raise its key repo rate again this year and its next move will be a cut of 25 basis points to 6.25% in the second quarter of 2024, a Reuters poll predicted.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-manufacturing-pmi-growth-september-eases-8966179/,business
China Evergrande soars after property developer’s stocks resume trading,Shares of debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group soared Tuesday after they resumed trading in Hong Kong following a suspension last week.,"Shares of debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group soared Tuesday after they resumed trading in Hong Kong following a suspension last week.
By midday, Evergrande’s shares were up nearly 16 per cent after jumping more than 60 per cent early in the session.
Evergrande is the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer and is at the center of a property market crisis that is dragging on China’s economic growth.

The company’s stock was suspended from trading last week as it confirmed Chinese police were investigating its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, on “suspicion of illegal crimes.” An affiliate, Evergrande Property Services, also resumed trading Tuesday, according to a notice on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
However, trading of shares in China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group remained suspended “pending the release of an announcement in relation to inside information” of the firm, a notice to the Hong Kong exchange said. Both units halted trading last week.
China Evergrande said in a notice on last week that authorities had informed the firm that its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, had been subjected to “mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes.” Evergrande is the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer and is at the center of a property market crisis that is dragging on China’s economic growth.
Last month, Evergrande said in a filing that it had to delay a proposed debt restructuring meeting with creditors as “sales of the group have not been as expected by the company.” Evergrande had also said last week that it could not issue new debt as its subsidiary, Hengda Real Estate, was under investigation.

China’s property sector is an important pillar of China’s economy. It has swooned since regulators tightened rules on borrowing in the property sector in 2020. That led to Evergrande defaulting on its debt.

"India’s crude oil imports – Russia, Iraq gain at Saudi Arabia’s expense in September","India’s oil imports from Riyadh in September were at around 556,185 bpd, down nearly a third from August volumes. Between January 2022 and August 2023, the import volumes averaged at over 750,000 bpd.","After falling in August, India’s imports of Russian and Iraqi oil recovered in September, most likely due to their price advantage over comparable Saudi Arabian crude grades, even as India’s overall crude oil imports slumped to their lowest this year as the refinery maintenance shutdown season kicked in, shows an analysis of data from commodity market analytics and intelligence firm Kpler.
India’s Russian oil imports had fallen to a seven-month low of 1.55 million barrels per day (million bpd) in August.

The monthly price hike, the fourth straight one due to the spurt in international prices of crude oil and jet fuel, is expected to put additional pressure on airlines and might result in higher airfares during the upcoming festival season that usually sees a surge in travel demand.
ATF, or jet fuel, is the single-biggest cost for airlines and for Indian carriers, it accounts for over 40 per cent of their operational expenses. Jet fuel prices have risen by over 32 per cent since June and the current price levels are the highest since November of last year. Industry insiders suggest that travel demand in the festival season is seen as much higher than last year, while airlines have not been able to add capacity significantly. Given the situation, high jet fuel prices could force flyers to shell out even more.

"Infra output grows 12.1% in August, fastest in over a year","A sharp rise in output of electricity and coal could be attributed to deficient rainfall during the month, which could have spiked power demand. The cumulative rainfall in August was 33% lower than the long-period average (LPA).","The production of India’s six core industries rose to a 14-month high of 12.1% in August, mainly due to a sharp increase in output of electricity and coal during the month. The production of electricity soared 14.9% year-on-year in August, and that of coal rose by 17.9%.
Electricity and coal collectively carry a weight of 30% in the overall index of eight core industries, which constitutes about 40% of the Index of Industrial Production. A 12.1% rise in core industries is likely to aid IIP growth further in August. In July, the IIP was at a five month high of 5.7%.

“Areas for improvement in the Indian government bond market structure highlighted by international investors remain largely unchanged from the previous March 2023 review,” FTSE said in its annual country classification review for the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI).
Indian government bonds and the local currency took the news in their stride.

Tesla sued by US agency over alleged harassment of Black factory workers,"The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in California that from 2015 to the present, Black workers at the Tesla plant have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti, including swastikas and nooses.","A U.S. civil rights agency sued Tesla Inc on Thursday, claiming the electric carmaker has tolerated severe harassment of Black employees at its flagship Fremont, California, assembly plant, in charges similar to cases brought by the state and by Tesla employees.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in California that from 2015 to the present, Black workers at the Tesla plant have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti, including swastikas and nooses.
Tesla has failed to investigate complaints of racist conduct and has fired or otherwise retaliated against workers who reported harassment, the EEOC said in the lawsuit.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuit adds federal charges to discrimination claims by the state of California and lawsuits by Tesla employees.
It follows the breakdown of settlement talks with the EEOC after Tesla announced that the agency had formally raised its concerns last year. The EEOC routinely settles lawsuits with employers, and it is relatively rare for the agency’s cases to go to trial.
Tesla faces several other race discrimination lawsuits that make similar claims, including a class action by workers at the Fremont plant and a lawsuit by a California civil rights agency. The company in those cases has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes workers complaints seriously.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company’s stock price rose 2.4% on Thursday to $246.38.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If the federal government gets involved, it certainly adds credibility to the claims,” said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University, who noted that he has advised investors on social responsibility at Tesla.
“Major institutional investors like pension funds will be very concerned about this type of behavior,” he said.
The EEOC in the lawsuit said it began investigating Tesla after the five-member commission’s chair, Charlotte Burrows, filed an internal complaint known as a charge against the company.
ADVERTISEMENT
After finding last year that there was “reasonable cause” to believe Tesla had violated the federal law banning workplace race discrimination, the agency tried and failed to enter into a settlement agreement with the company, according to the lawsuit.
Burrows in a statement said that combating widespread workplace harassment is a key priority for the EEOC.
“Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,” she said.
The EEOC’s lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for an unspecified number of Black workers, along with an order requiring Tesla to overhaul its policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation.
Tesla is seeking to fend off similar claims from the California Civil Rights Department, a state-level counterpart of the EEOC. The department alleges that Tesla discriminated against Black workers when making decisions about pay, promotions and work assignments.
ADVERTISEMENT
The department’s lawsuit alleges violations of California law, while the EEOC case involves similar federal laws.
Tesla has claimed that the California department’s lawsuit was politically motivated and has argued that the agency violated state law by suing without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.
ADVERTISEMENT
A California judge last year rejected Tesla’s motion to dismiss that case, and is now considering various issues related to pre-trial discovery.

Oil spoils market mood; VIX rises 11%,"NSE Nifty 50 Volatility Index (VIX), which is a gauge of expected volatility over the course of the next 30 days, rose 11% — the most since March 13, according to Bloomberg. ","Benchmark indices ended lower on Thursday as rising crude oil prices and weaker global cues dampened the market mood. The market was dragged down by declines in IT, technology, fast moving consumer goods, consumer durables and automobile stocks.
The BSE declined over 610 points, about 0.92%, to close at 65,508.32, while the NSE fell about 193 points, about 0.98%, to end the day at 19,523.55.

The fall resulted in investor wealth declining by `2.95 trillion to `316.7 trillion during the session.
Ambareesh Baliga, independent market analyst, said that along with higher oil prices and weak global cues, the hawkish stance of US Federal Reserve, where there are fears of a rate hike at the end of 2023, continues to worry investors. This will have a negative impact as more institutional money will flow out.
“Nifty has good support at 19,500-19,600. If the market cracks from there, then one will see a sharper correction of about 750-1,000 points on the Nifty,” said Baliga, adding that this band is being closely watched.

Air India frontline staff to soon have new uniforms; airline partners with fashion designer Manish Malhotra,"The airline has partnered with Malhotra to design new uniforms for more than 10,000 employees on the frontline, including cabin crew, cockpit crew, ground and security staff.","Air India’s flying crew, ground and security staff will soon sport new uniforms designed by fashion designer Manish Malhotra as the Tata Group-owned airline embraces a new global brand identity.
As Air India pursues a revival and modernisation plan, the new uniforms are expected to be introduced for the frontline staff by the end of this year and are likely to coincide with the induction of the airline’s first wide-body A350 aircraft into its fleet.
Malhotra — whose career spans more than 30 years as a couturier, costume stylist, and entrepreneur — and his team have started meeting Air India’s frontline staff, conducting discussions and fitting sessions with them to better understand their specialised needs, the airline said in a release on Thursday. The last time when there was a change in uniforms for Air India staff was in 2015 and at that time, the loss-making carrier was under government control.

“We are working closely with Manish and his team to combine elements of our brand, our heritage and our culture, together with the unique requirements of the airline environment, for what we hope will be a fresh and exciting new look that supports and represents the new Air India,” the airline’s CEO and MD Campbell Wilson said.

The airline has partnered with Malhotra to design new uniforms for more than 10,000 employees on the frontline, including cabin crew, cockpit crew, ground and security staff.
Malhotra said it is an absolute honour to collaborate with Air India, “our national flying ambassadors”. “Our shared ideology is simple yet profound: to evolve without erasing, to modernise without forgetting. Together, we aim to intertwine tradition with the future, crafting uniforms where comfort meets authenticity, wrapped in timeless elegance,” he said.
Currently, female cabin crew wear saree or kurta in red or blue colour. Male cabin crew sports white shirt, black trousers and a black jet.
There are around 8,000 flying crew at Air India.
On Tuesday, a source said the new uniforms are expected to be introduced at the time of inducting A350 aircraft later this year. Last month, Tata Group-owned Air India unveiled its new brand identity ‘The Vista’ inspired by the peak of the golden window frame that signifies “limitless possibilities” and a new aircraft livery. Earlier this year, Air India placed orders for 470 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.

Increased monthly GST collections mainly on account of higher compliance: CBIC chief,"CBIC chief Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Thursday said increased monthly GST collections are mainly on account of higher compliance, and the GST Council's decision to tighten return filing and registration process would help reduce fake ITC claims in evasion prone sectors, including iron and steel.","CBIC chief Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Thursday said increased monthly GST collections are mainly on account of higher compliance, and the GST Council’s decision to tighten return filing and registration process would help reduce fake ITC claims in evasion prone sectors, including iron and steel.
Agarwal said the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has received suggestions regarding streamlining tax rates in evasion-prone sectors and all that is being discussed.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection was Rs 1.87 lakh crore in April and in the first four months of the current fiscal, the collections have averaged Rs 1.67 lakh crore.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The buoyancy of revenue is 1.43 of nominal GDP growth meaning thereby revenue collection is not entirely on account of growth in GDP, but a major contribution is made by increased compliance level,” the CBIC chief said at the Ficci Cascade event here.
Tax buoyancy explains the relationship between changes in government tax revenue growth and changes in GDP.
To enhance compliance, the department has taken a soft approach of nudging taxpayers for timely and accurate filing of returns and selecting taxpayers for scrutiny and audit by risk analysis.
“Less than 1 per cent of taxpayers are selected for scrutiny by way of audit based on risk behaviour analysis,” Agarwal said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Agarwal said the government is taking all possible measures to encourage tax compliance and dissuade fraudsters from entering the GST system.
“The recent decisions in successive council meetings to make changes in return filing are in that direction so that menace of fake ITC can be curbed,” he said, adding that many sectors, like that of iron and steel, are impacted by the menace of fake input tax credit to a large extent.
Agarwal said that the solution to deal with fake ITC generation is quite complex and the department has received various suggestions regarding rates.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It is being discussed. It’s not just iron and steel but other sectors also,” he said, adding that the GST Council’s recent decision on the return filing and registration process would help in solving the problem of fake ITC and fake businesses.
In June, CBIC introduced validation and risk rating for GST registrations, as it looks to curb fake entities issuing fake bills just to claim ITC benefits and defraud the exchequer.
In a two-month-long special drive to detect fake registration, the CBIC officers have identified over 9,000 bogus entities and detected about Rs 11,000 crore worth of GST.

TCS of 5 per cent will continue to be levied on annual expenses exceeding Rs 7 lakh towards medical treatment and education each.
For those availing loans for overseas education, a lower TCS rate of 0.5 per cent would continue to be levied above the Rs 7 lakh threshold.

The use of an International Credit Card for making payments towards meeting expenses while on a visit abroad is not part of the LRS and hence will not be subject to TCS.

Addressing a press conference, Gadkari further said the government is considering offering incentives to construction equipment manufacturers for not using fossil fuels.
“We are finalising the policy for using municipal waste in road construction,” he said.

Gadkari said his ministry has formulated a draft policy that will promote use of alternative fuel in construction equipment to reduce cost and dependence on fossil fuels.
The road ministry is in talks with the finance ministry for approval, he said.
“Incentives like interest subvention scheme can be worked out so that concessionaires or contractors can invest in construction equipment running on alternate fuels instead of fossil fuels,” the minister said.
Gadkari said his ministry has taken several initiatives to decarbonise the transport sector and that the government is working on developing electric highways between Delhi and Jaipur.

Electric highways cater to electric traction for vehicles in the same manner as is done for railways. This is based on a prevalent technology in countries like Sweden and Norway. It involves the provision of power cables, which can be utilised by a vehicle which caters to this type of technology. The vehicle will utilise the power from this cable for its traction.
At present, the ministry is evaluating various technologies.
Talking about the alternate bio fuels in the country, Gadkari said he has been a strong proponent of creating an ethanol economy and has been pushing for large-scale uptake of ethanol to boost agricultural growth by 6 per cent.
He said that by 2025, there will be a mandate to use 1 per cent sustainable aviation fuel with prospective plans to escalate it to 5 per cent blending in India.

Gadkari said he is pushing the GenSet industry to only operate on ethanol- based generators in the time to come.
He said hydrogen is the fuel for the future and the most important way through which India can become a net exporter of energy.

Current account deficit in April-June narrows from previous year but widens sequentially,"The widening of CAD on a quarter-on-quarter basis was primarily on account of higher trade deficit coupled with a lower surplus in net services and decline in private transfer receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said Thursday.","India’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to $9.2 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in the first quarter (April-June) of 2023-24 from $17.9 billion (2.1 per cent of GDP) in the same period last year. But it was higher than the $1.3 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in the preceding quarter.
A deficit in the current account indicates that a country’s imports (including goods, services and investments) are greater than its is exports.
The widening of CAD on a quarter-on-quarter basis was primarily on account of higher trade deficit coupled with a lower surplus in net services and decline in private transfer receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said Thursday.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Current account deficit is expected to rise on-quarter in the first quarter of FY24 as merchandise trade deficit has widened again and the services trade surplus has moderated a tad,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, CRISIL Ltd.
Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, said the second quarter of FY24 will see a substantial widening of CAD led by sequential worsening of trade balance, led by higher oil and core imports, and slowing services exports. All of this will imply that the Q2 CAD/GDP ratio could be more than double of Q1 FY24, ranging from 2.4-2.6 per cent, Arora said.
The central bank said net services receipts decreased sequentially, primarily owing to a decline in exports of computer, travel and business services. But these receipts remained higher on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, RBI said. Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, moderated to $27.1 billion in Q1 of FY24 from $28.6 billion in Q4 of FY23 but increased y-o-y.
“The fall in remittances, both on-quarter and on-year, is worrisome and will bear watching, more so because of slowing global growth. This can have a bearing on CAD, which was anyway expected to rise sequentially in the first quarter of this fiscal because of higher merchandise trade deficit and softening in services trade surplus,” Joshi said.
ADVERTISEMENT
To boot, the recent uptick in oil prices will weigh on merchandise trade deficit.
“Together, these have put upside pressure on our estimate of CAD for this fiscal, which stands at 1.8% of GDP,” Crisil said.
Net outgo on the income account, primarily reflecting payments of investment income, declined to $10.6 billion in Q1 of FY24 from $12.6 billion in Q4 of FY23, though higher than a year ago, the RBI said.

In the financial account, net foreign direct investment decreased to $5.1 billion from $13.4 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment recorded inflows of $15.7 billion as against net outflows of $14.6 billion in Q1 of FY23.
Net external commercial borrowings to India recorded an inflow of $5.6 billion in Q1 of FY24 as against an outflow of $2.9 billion a year ago. Non-resident deposits recorded net inflows of $2.2 billion as compared with $0.3 billion in Q1 of FY23.
External debt at $629.1 bn
India’s external debt was placed at $629.1 billion as of June 2023, recording an increase of $4.7 billion over its level at end-March 2023. The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.6 per cent at end-June 2023 from 18.8 per cent at end-March 2023, RBI said.
Valuation effect due to the appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the major currencies such as yen and SDR amounted to $3.1 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, external debt would have increased by $7.8 billion instead of $4.7 billion at end-June 2023 over end-March 2023, it said.

Vedanta to spin off four commodity companies: Report,"Vedanta will spin off its metals, power, aluminium and oil and gas businesses, with an official announcement likely to come this week, reported Reuters.","Indian conglomerate Vedanta Ltd will separate its commodities businesses into four companies to get better valuations, a source with direct knowledge of the move told Reuters on Thursday.
The company will spin off its metals, power, aluminium and oil and gas businesses, with an official announcement likely to come this week, the source said.
The move will need shareholder and other regulatory approvals and the process could take two to three months, the source said, declining to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

Vedanta did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request seeking comments.
The company was valued at 776.29 billion rupees ($9.33 billion) as of Wednesday, down by about a third so far this year. Its shares climbed 1.2% on Thursday morning following the reports of a split.
Chairman Anil Agarwal said last month that Vedanta will consider separately listing all or some of its businesses, in contrast to a failed attempt in 2020 to delist the company to speed up the process of simplifying its corporate structure.
Vedanta Resources, the UK-based parent of Vedanta Ltd, should be bringing in equity investors, instead of the debt-swap moves they have been doing, due to its debt repayment issues, said Deven Choksey, managing director of KRChoksey Shares and Securities.

Vedanta Resources, which has a debt load of $7.7 billion, has been struggling to raise funds due to rating downgrades and concerns about meeting its debt obligations.
Furthermore, Choksey said, Vedanta Resources has limited ability to demerge other units, given the charge of creditors on cash-generating assets, particularly Hindustan Zinc.
Earlier this year, Agarwal sought to trim down the group’s debt by getting Hindustan Zinc, a unit of Vedanta Ltd, to buy some of the parent group’s zinc assets in a $2.98 billion deal.

Evergrande shares halted as concerns mount about developer’s prospect,"Trading in the shares of Evergrande and two of its units were suspended on Thursday, a day after Bloomberg reported that its Chairman Hui Ka Yan was taken away by police this month and was being monitored at a designated location.","Trading in shares of China Evergrande Group was suspended on Thursday after a report that its chairman had been placed under police watch, as concerns mounted about the cash-strapped developer’s future amid growing liquidation risk.
With more than $300 billion in liabilities – roughly the size of Finland’s gross domestic product – Evergrande has become the poster child of a debt crisis in China’s property sector, which contributes to roughly a quarter of the economy.
Trading in the shares of Evergrande and two of its units were suspended on Thursday, a day after Bloomberg reported that its Chairman Hui Ka Yan was taken away by police this month and was being monitored at a designated location.

The report said it was not clear why Hui was under surveillance and Reuters could not immediately verify the news. Evergrande and the police authorities have not responded to Reuters requests for comment.
Evergrande has been working to get creditors’ approval for restructuring its offshore debt. The process got complicated this week after Evergrande said it was unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main China unit.
The offshore debt restructuring plan now looks set to falter and the risks of the company being liquidated are rising, some analysts said.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that a major Evergrande offshore creditor group was planning to join a liquidation court petition filed against the developer if it does not submit a new debt revamp plan by the end of October.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It is unclear why Hui is under police surveillance, but it may signal certain negotiations demanded from the government. The latest development has disrupted the hope of restructuring,” said Gary Ng, Asia Pacific senior economist at Natixis.
“No developer is too big to fail in China, and therefore it is hard to imagine a full bail-out. Still, when it comes to stability, it is possible to see more government influence in different ways,” Ng said.
The company shares ended down 19% on Wednesday in the Hong Kong market, taking their losses to 81% since the resumption of trading in late August after a 17-month suspension.

Evergrande’s latest woes come against the backdrop of Beijing rolling out a raft of measures in the last few weeks, including cutting of existing mortgage rates, to revive the battered property sector.
The recent regulatory easing may stabilize the housing market in the world’s second-largest economy to some extent, Saxo Greater China Market Strategist Redmond Wong wrote in a research note.
“Still, the overhang of housing inventories in lower-tier cities facing population decline will persist for several years,” he said.
“This will lead to more headlines about defaults, restructuring, and liquidation of insolvent developers, causing losses for shareholders, bondholders, banks, and investors in trust and wealth management products tied to property projects.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/evergrande-shares-halted-as-concerns-mount-about-developers-prospect-8959560/,business

"Moody’s downgrades Vedanta Resources, outlook remains negative","Moody's said it has downgraded to Caa2 from Caa1, the corporate family rating (CFR) of Vedanta Resources Limited (VRL). At the same time, Moody's has maintained a negative outlook.","Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded the rating of Vedanta Resources Ltd because of the elevated risk of debt restructuring over the next few months, as the firm has not made progress on refinancing its upcoming debt maturities.
Moody’s said it has downgraded to Caa2 from Caa1, the corporate family rating (CFR) of Vedanta Resources Limited (VRL). At the same time, Moody’s has maintained a negative outlook.
“The downgrade reflects the elevated risk of debt restructuring over the next few months because VRL has not made any meaningful progress on refinancing its upcoming debt maturities, in particular the USD 1 billion bonds maturing each in January 2024 and August 2024,” said Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody’s Senior Vice President and lead analyst on VRL.
ADVERTISEMENT
VRL’s credit quality is constrained by its weak liquidity because of large refinancing needs and interest expenses amid tightening financing conditions in global capital markets, the agency noted.
“The company continues to face challenges in refinancing its debt, a reflection of reduced appetite from the lending community, and a key credit concern,” the rating agency said.
“VRL’s Caa category CFR reflects the company’s unsustainable capital structure, aggressive risk appetite and weak financial management.” In August 2023, VRL sold a 4.3 per cent stake in key subsidiary Vedanta Limited (VDL) for around USD 500 million to stave off some of the pressure arising from the holding company’s imminent cash needs.
“Given that its entire shareholding in VDL and that VDL’s entire 64.9 per cent shareholding in Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL), which holds around two-thirds of the group’s consolidated cash, have already been pledged, this implies VRL has limited financial flexibility to raise financing,” the rating agency said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moody’s said a softening commodity price environment will somewhat strain the ability of VRL’s operating subsidiaries to generate cash flow. More importantly, the potential for contagion risk from the holding company’s debt woes may also impair the operating subsidiaries’ ability to raise funds to distribute dividends.
“The negative outlook reflects VRL’s persistently weak liquidity profile and Moody’s concerns over the company’s ability to address the imminent cash needs, especially at the holding company,” it said.
Holding company VRL’s liquidity remains persistently weak, with management fees and dividends from operating subsidiaries insufficient to meet its looming debt maturities, it said.
Liquidity at VRL’s subsidiaries also remains weak.
ADVERTISEMENT
VRL’s 63.8 per cent owned subsidiary VDL reported consolidated cash of Rs 14,290 crore (USD 1.7 billion) as of June 30, 2023.
“VDL’s consolidated cash and expected cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet capital expenditure, its own debt-servicing requirements and the large dividends to address the holding company’s cash needs,” it added.
Vedanta Resources Limited (VRL), headquartered in London, is a diversified resources company, with interests mainly in India. Its main operations are held by Vedanta Limited (VDL), a 63.8 per cent-owned subsidiary. Through VRL’s various operating subsidiaries, the group produces oil and gas, zinc, lead, silver, aluminium, iron ore, steel and power.
Delisted from the London Stock Exchange in October 2018, VRL is now wholly owned by Volcan Investments Ltd. Founder chairman of VRL, Anil Agarwal, and his family, are the key shareholders of Volcan.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, VRL generated revenues of USD 18.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of USD 4.8 billion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/moodys-downgrades-vedanta-resources-outlook-remains-negative-8958945/,business
Diamond industry associations ask members to temporarily stop import of rough diamonds,"The circular was issued jointly on Tuesday by the Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), Bharat Diamond Bourse, Surat Diamond Bourse, Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association and Surat Diamond Association.","The gems and jewellery industry has asked its members to stop import of rough diamonds for two months starting from October 15 amid slowing global demand and rising inventories of domestic players.
“…demand for loose polished diamonds and jewellery from large consuming economies such as the USA and China have been materially affected over the last many quarters, on the back of all-time highs of 2021 and 2022, with a visible slowdown in orders.
“As a result, our country’s exports have declined by 25 per cent during January-August, with a similar trend in September. Due to such factors, our inventories in polished diamonds have increased over the past few months and prices are softer as an effect of this mismatch in demand vs. supply,” according to a circular.
ADVERTISEMENT
The circular was issued jointly on Tuesday by the Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), Bharat Diamond Bourse, Surat Diamond Bourse, Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association and Surat Diamond Association.
Mining companies are regularly selling the rough diamonds that are being mined, irrespective of the state of demand in the midstream segment, the circular said.
Broadly, midstream segment refers to polishing and manufacturing activities in the diamond industry.
“They believe that the midstream is a mature segment of the pipeline and they will only purchase rough diamonds if there is a real demand.
ADVERTISEMENT
“In other words, they rely on the midstream to gauge the demand for rough diamonds and are happy to respond with corresponding levels of supply. This puts the onus on the midstream to transmit real levels of demand by translating our need for supply of rough diamonds to all mining companies,” it added.
To protect the interest of the industry, particularly the small and medium enterprises, the circular said there is a need to take additional measures.
“Members may be advised to halt the import of rough diamonds beginning October 15 to December 15, 2023. It was assessed that halting imports of rough diamonds will help the industry better manage the balance between demand and supply, thereby protecting the value of assets and increasing consumer confidence,” it added.
ADVERTISEMENT
The situation will again be reviewed in the first week of December 2023.
According to the circular, the appeal is for voluntary suspension of import of rough diamonds while allowing diamond manufacturing factories to continue their operations without interruption.
GJEPC said it is dedicated to rejuvenating demand in significant markets with the help of all other trade bodies, the government, the Natural Diamond Council, the rough diamond mining companies and like-minded bodies in the US.
“Simultaneously, we are also exploring alternative markets such as GCC, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and others …this year, we successfully established a dedicated diamond section within the India International Jewellery Show (IIJS), resulting in a noticeable boost in demand of diamonds in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent,” GJEPC added.
Former GJEPC chairman and Kama Jewelry managing director Colin Shah said the voluntary ban on natural rough diamonds is a remedial measure that will help diamond traders, especially the small and medium-sized, to ease their inventories and, at the same time, help the Indian diamond industry derive a fair price.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The diamond industry has incurred voluntary bans in the past with the only motive of bringing stability in the overall demand and supply dynamics and fostering the economic growth of the country by promoting robust exports. This may have some impact on the Indian diamond polishing business in the immediate phase but will eventually be beneficial for the overall industry in the long run,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/diamond-industry-associations-ask-members-temporarily-stop-import-rough-diamonds-8958770/,business

"BYJU’s to lay off up to 3,500 employees this fiscal","BYJU's had ""over hired"" people at the time of Covid pandemic due to sudden jump in online education, but the demand has now receded, for which the company needs to do the course correction, reported PTI quoting sources.","Edtech major BYJU’s may lay off up to 3,500 employees during the current fiscal as it looks to consolidate teams and enhance regional focus, sources privy to the development said.
According to one of the sources, BYJU’s had “over hired” people at the time of Covid pandemic due to sudden jump in online education, but the demand has now receded, for which the company needs to do the course correction.
“There has been no retrenchment as of now. The company is in the process of restructuring and assessing demand across various units. Around 1,000 people were already serving notice periods, and another 1,000 have not completed their performance improvement parameters. Assessment is still underway. About 3,000-3,500 may be impacted due the whole exercise,” a source, who did not wish to be identified, told PTI.

The sources said this will be the last lay off at BYJU’s payroll and the entire exercise will be over by October end.
“The final phase of restructuring intends to optimise business by bringing together multiple divisions and creating a clear accountability-driven structure. The 3,000-3,500 is an estimate and not the target of the company,” the source said.
When contacted, BYJU’s spokesperson said: “We are in the final stages of a business restructuring exercise to simplify operating structures, reduce the cost base and better cash flow management. BYJU’S new India CEO Arjun Mohan will be completing this process in the next few weeks and will steer a revamped and sustainable operation ahead.” The sources said that several business units were created to meet the growth requirement during the pandemic and there were few product experiments that were carried out but they did not work out well.
“There will be now simple organisation structure divided between K12 education and other competitive examinations. It will focus on consumer behaviour services. Regional teams will have more accountability. There will be a large focus on hybrid models and tuition centres which need to be run in a decentralised manner with regional focus,” the source said.

The lay-off exercise is expected to impact 300-400 mid-level employees.
“Most of the business built up during Covid was with focus on new customers. BYJU’s is going through the same phase like other big technology companies, where lay-offs have happened due to course correction and to build sustainable business models. BYJU’s will enhance focus on existing customers,” the source said.

"Mukesh Ambani’s children will get no salary, only fee for attending board meetings",Mukesh Ambani's three children - twins Akash and Isha (both 31) and Anant (28 years) - will get only a sitting fee and a commission on the profit earned by Reliance Industries.,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s three children as directors of Reliance Industries Ltd will be paid only a fee for attending board and committee meetings, the company said in a resolution seeking shareholder nod for their appointment on its board.
While Ambani, 66, drew nil salary from the company since the 2020-21 fiscal year, other executive directors including his cousins Nikhil and Hital are paid a salary, perquisites, allowances and commission.
His three children – twins Akash and Isha (both 31) and Anant (28 years) – will get only a sitting fee and a commission on the profit earned by the firm.
ADVERTISEMENT
The terms of the appointment of the three are the same as the ones on which Ambani’s wife Nita was appointed to the company board in 2014. She earned a sitting fee of Rs 6 lakh and a commission of Rs 2 crore in the 2022-23 fiscal year (April 2022 to March 2023), according to the company’s latest annual report.
Ambani, 66, had at the company’s annual shareholders meeting last month announced that his three children Akash, Isha and Anant would be inducted into Reliance’s board of directors (BoD).
He also stated that he would continue to be the chairman and CEO of the company for five more years, with a focus on grooming and empowering its ‘next-gen’ leaders.
Reliance has now sent out a postal ballot to shareholders seeking a nod for their appointment as board of directors of the company.

“They shall be paid remuneration by way of fee for attending meetings of the Board or Committees thereof or for any other meetings as may be decided by the Board, reimbursement of expenses for participating in the Board and other meetings and profit-related commission,” the notice said.
Reliance has five broad verticals – the oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that houses the world’s largest single-location refining complex and petrochemical plants, telecom and digital business, retail (both physical and online), new energy, and recently launched financial services.
Ambani first talked of a succession plan at the oil-to-telecom conglomerate in 2022, where he announced that each of his three children would head various divisions of the company (Akash to head telecom, Isha to head retail, and Anant to head new energy).
ADVERTISEMENT
He did not divulge the succession plan for Reliance’s mainstay oil-to-chemicals or O2C business division.
Reliance shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) last month gave a nod to Ambani getting another five-year term till 2029 as the head of India’s most valuable company. And just like the past three years, he has opted to draw nil salary during this period.
As part of the succession planning, Nita resigned as a director of Reliance but she has been made a permanent invitee to all board meetings – a status which none on the board enjoy – Mukesh Ambani and other directors need shareholders’ nod for any extension beyond their current approved terms but she will continue on the board in perpetuity.
Isha, a graduate of Yale University with a double major in Psychology and South Asia Studies and an MBA from Stanford University, “is driving the expansion of Reliance Retail into new categories, geographies and formats,” the shareholder notice said.
“She has been instrumental in the expansion of Reliance Retail’s own brand portfolio including the acquisition of some exciting Indian brands and launch of the ‘Independence’ brand,” it added.

Isha directly holds 0.12 per cent equity shares of the company.
Ambani owns 41.46 per cent of Reliance shares.
Akash, an economics graduate of Brown University, US, heads India’s biggest telecom company Jio. “At Jio, he spearheads the creation of products and services that leverage new-age technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and the Internet of Things,” it said.

Anant, also a graduate of Brown University, “is driving the expansion of energy and materials businesses of Reliance and its global operations in renewable and green energy.” “Under his leadership, Reliance aims to become a Net Carbon Zero company by 2035 by building world-scale capabilities in the production of clean fuels and materials of the future, developing next-generation carbon capture and storage technologies, creating holistic and circular materials businesses, and maximising crude to chemicals conversion,” the notice said.
Akash and Isha have been on the board of directors of both Jio and Reliance Retail since October 2014. Besides being on the boards of firms helming new energy businesses, Anant is also on boards of retail and Jio. Isha has been appointed director on the board of Jio Financial Services.

Mukesh Ambani has been on the board of Reliance since 1977 and was elevated as chairman of the company after the death of his father and group patriarch Dhiburhai Ambani in July 2002.
He had capped his annual remuneration at Rs 15 crore from financial year 2008-09 (April 2008 to March 2009) to FY20 – 11 years; and since FY21, he opted to forego his salary, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, until the company and all its businesses were fully back to their earnings potential.
Accordingly, he has not been paid any salary and profit-based commission for three years in a row beginning FY21.
At his request, the company Board has recommended that no salary or profit-based commission be paid to him for the new term from April 19, 2024, till April 18, 2029.
The remuneration of his cousins Nikhil and Hital Meswani rose to Rs 25 crore each, including Rs 17.28 crore commission (unchanged from the previous fiscal year), according to the annual report for 2022-23.
Executive Directors P M S Prasad and Pawan Kumar Kapil saw their remuneration rise.
While Prasad drew Rs 13.50 crore in 2022-23 including performance-linked incentives for 2021-22 which was paid in 2022-23. In 2021-22, he drew Rs 11.89 crore.
Kapil got Rs 4.40 crore, up from Rs 4.22 crore in 2021-22. He completed his 5-year term on May 15, 2023, and has since ceased to be a director of the company.
Ambani’s wife Nita, a non-executive director on the company’s board, earned Rs 6 lakh as a sitting fee (up from Rs 5 lakh in 2021-22) and another Rs 2 crore commission for 2022-23 (unchanged from the previous fiscal). She had in 2020-21 got Rs 8 lakh sitting fee and another Rs 1.65 crore commission.
Besides Nita Ambani, other non-executive directors include Dipak C Jain, Raghunath A Mashelkar, Adil Zainulbhai, Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji, former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former CVC K V Chowdary and Saudi sovereign wealth fund nominee Yasir Othman H Al Rumayyan.

Govt aims 60% of wheat area under climate resilient varieties in rabi season amid El Nino fear,"Ahead of rabi sowing from next month, the Centre on Tuesday said it targets to bring 60 per cent of the total wheat area of 30 million hectare under the climate-resistant varieties amid strong El Nino conditions.","Ahead of rabi sowing from next month, the Centre on Tuesday said it targets to bring 60 per cent of the total wheat area of 30 million hectare under the climate-resistant varieties amid strong El Nino conditions.
Despite the challenges of climate change, the Union Agriculture Ministry has kept a target of achieving a record wheat output of 114 million tonne in the 2023-24 rabi season against the actual output of 112.74 million tonne in the year-ago period.
Sowing of wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, begins in October, while harvesting starts in March/April.
ADVERTISEMENT
Addressing a national conference held to chalk out a strategy for sowing rabi (winter) crops, Agriculture Secretary Manoj Ahuja said: “There are certain changes in climate change, which is affecting agriculture. Our strategy is climate resilient seeds”.
Faced with a heatwave in 2021, the government encouraged farmers in 2022 to go for heat-tolerant wheat varieties in 47 per cent of the total wheat acreage of 30 million hectares.
“We are targetting to increase the coverage of area under heat-tolerant wheat varieties to 60 per cent this year,” Ahuja told PTI on the sidelines of the event and urged states to push farmers to grow heat-resistant varieties.
While addressing the event, the secretary said more than 800 climate-resistant varieties are available in the country. These seeds need to be put in the seed chain as part of the seed rolling plan.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As a strategy, I request all states to identify specific areas and map varieties that can be sown,” he added.
Calling upon states to be prepared to tackle the changing climate patterns, the secretary said, “If the pattern of rainfall, temperature, variation keep changing, then it will affect the agriculture”.
“We have seen how rainfall patterns are changing. We had a deficit in June, a surplus in July, dry in August and again excess rainfall in September. As a result, there is a five per cent rainfall deficit in the country.” There is also a severe deficit in reservoirs in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka compared to the 10-year average, he noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Taking into consideration the reservoir level and ground resources, Ahuja said the state governments should plan for the rabi season.
“There is still monsoon expected in October-November in certain states. IMD is still saying El Nino conditions are strong. They would be predicting, but I think you should be ready and states should keep this in mind while preparing for rabi season,” he added.
The secretary said the government is ready with a contingency plan for 450 villages. The ministry is working on a framework that will be rolled out across villages to make farmers understand the impact of climate change and how they respond.
He also asked states to focus on narrowing down the yield gap in pulses while also stressing the need to share accurate farm data for estimating foodgrains production.
Echoing concerns, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Director General Himanshu Pathak said the council has developed over 2,200 crop varieties, out of which 800 are climate resilient.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Farmers will get immediate benefit if they use these seeds…My suggestion is to promote climate resilient varieties not only for wheat but also for other crops like rice and pulses,” Ahuja said.
He also suggested that farmers use biofortified crop varieties, balanced use of fertilisers, and precision farming.
ADVERTISEMENT
Fertiliser Secretary Rajat Kumar Mishra said fertiliser is one crop input after water that influences production and stressed on balanced use of crop nutrients.
He also mentioned that nano urea and DAP fertilisers are going to be the future.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-wheat-area-under-climate-resilient-varieties-rabi-season-el-nino-fear-8956944/,business

Competition Commission of India (CCI), on September 1, approved the proposed merger of Vistara with Air India under a deal wherein Singapore Airlines will also acquire a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India.
Certain competition concerns due to the proposed merger were raised by the watchdog and to address them, the airlines have given certain commitments with respect to the merger.

As per the commitments, Air India has voluntarily offered to maintain “minimum capacity/ supply level” on certain overlapping O&D (Origin & Destination) domestic and overseas routes.
They are Bhubaneshwar-Delhi, Bengaluru-Guwahati, Cochin-Delhi, Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram, Amritsar-Delhi, Bhubaneshwar-Mumbai and Bengaluru-Delhi in the domestic segment, according to a 73-page CCI order that has been made public.
The international routes where Air India will maintain minimum capacity/ supply level are Delhi-Sydney, Delhi-Melbourne, Delhi-Paris and Delhi-Frankfurt.
On these domestic and international routes, both Air India and Vistara operate flights.

Further, Air India and Singapore Airlines will maintain minimum capacity/ supply level in relation to certain overlapping O&D pairs between India and Singapore — Delhi-Singapore, Mumbai-Singapore, Tiruchirappalli-Singapore and Chennai-Singapore.
“The Commission notes that the voluntary capacity commitments offered by the parties seem to address the likely competition concerns that could otherwise result from the proposed combination and thus decided not to proceed further with the investigation in the matter,” the order, dated September 1, said.
The merger deal would mark a major consolidation in India’s fast-growing aviation space.

Once the merger concludes, Singapore Airlines will be allotted additional shares in the merged entity through a preferential allotment. The deal will make Air India the country’s largest international carrier and second-largest domestic carrier.

"India to set emission reduction mandates for 4 sectors, to start carbon trading from 2025: Report","India will set carbon emission reduction targets for four fossil fuel dependent sectors, as the Asian country looks to align its industry with the country's greenhouse emissions reduction target, two government officials said.","India will set carbon emission reduction targets for four fossil fuel dependent sectors, as the Asian country looks to align its industry with the country’s greenhouse emissions reduction target, two government officials said.
The country will fix carbon emission intensity benchmarks and reduction targets for three years for companies in petrochemicals, iron and steel, cement and pulp and paper, two government officials, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. The market trading cycle will be annual, they said.
The companies in the four sectors are also likely to be the first ones to trade on the country’s carbon trading market from April 2025, the officials added, which will enable them buy and sell carbon credits to met their goals.
ADVERTISEMENT
Companies which exceed their targets earn carbon credits that can be sold to firms which fall short of their goals.
“The mandates will be applicable from 2024-25 and the (carbon) trade will start in 2025-26,” one top government official said.
The targets will be aligned with the country’s emission intensity – the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions emitted for every unit increase of gross domestic product (GDP) – reduction goals submitted to the United Nations, the officials said.
India has committed to cutting its ratio of greenhouse emissions to gross domestic product by 2030 to 45% of its 2005 level and to net zero by 2070.
ADVERTISEMENT
The carbon credits will be traded on the proposed carbon market provided under a legislation cleared by the Indian Parliament in December last year.
India’s ministries of environment and power did not respond to a query from Reuters.
The proposed Indian carbon market is different from those created in developed countries as they set a limit on emissions and then allocate tradable permits, or credits, to emitter industries.

The targets for reducing each sector’s emissions are being set by a committee comprising of key ministries such as environment, power and renewable energy.
The rules and targets for the industries are likely to be announced before December, the two officials said.
India already has a market for trading certificates in above-target energy savings for entities in 13 sectors.

Moody’s report on Aadhaar made sweeping assertions without citing any evidence: UIDAI,"International credit agency Moody's Investors Service has made sweeping assertions against Aadhaar without citing any evidence, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said on Monday.","International credit agency Moody’s Investors Service has made sweeping assertions against Aadhaar without citing any evidence, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said on Monday.
The UIDAI issued a strong rebuttal to Moody’s Investors Service which claimed that the Aadhaar system often results in service denials and the reliability of biometric technologies, especially for manual labourers, in hot and humid climates is questionable.
“A certain investor service has, without citing any evidence or basis, made sweeping assertions against Aadhaar, the most trusted digital ID in the world. Over the last decade, over a billion Indians have expressed their trust in Aadhaar by using it to authenticate themselves over 100 billion times,” the UIDAI said in a statement.

The unique id Aadhaar’s custodian said that the report in question does not cite either primary or secondary data or research in support of the opinions presented in it.
“The investor service did not make any attempt to ascertain facts regarding the issues raised by it from the Authority. The sole reference cited in the report is in respect of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), by referring to its website. However, the report incorrectly cites the number of Aadhaars issued as 1.2 billion, although the website prominently gives the updated numbers,” the UIDAI said.
It said that the report ignores that biometric submission is also possible through contactless means such as face authentication and iris authentication.
“In addition, the option of mobile OTP is also available in many use cases. The report also avers that there are security and privacy vulnerabilities in a centralised Aadhaar system. The factual position in this regard has been repeatedly disclosed in response to Parliament questions, where Parliament has been categorically informed that till date no breach has been reported from the Aadhaar database,” the statement said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/moodys-aadhaar-report-sweeping-assertions-without-evidence-uidai-8956470/,business
"Asian shares dip with eyes on China economy, US shutdown","Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6 per cent in morning trading to 32,469.85.","Asian shares mostly sank Tuesday over worries about a possible US government shutdown and the troubled Chinese economy.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6 per cent in morning trading to 32,469.85. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.5 per cent to 7,042.50. South Korea’s Kospi dropped nearly 1.0 per cent to 2,471.30. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.9 per cent to 17,578.90, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 3,110.86.

“The Chinese property woes are far from over, as the notorious developer Evergrande defaulted on its 4 billion yuan onshore bond repayment and delayed the restructuring meetings,” said Tina Teng, market analyst at CMC Markets APAC & Canada.
Wall Street clawed back some of its steep losses from last week. The S&P 500 rose 17.38, or 0.4 per cent, to 4,337.44, coming off its worst week in six months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 43.04, or 0.1 per cent, to 34,006.88, and the Nasdaq composite gained 59.51, or 0.5 per cent, to 13,271.32.
Realisation is sinking in that the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates high well into next year. The Fed is trying to ensure high inflation gets back down to its target, and it said last week it will likely cut interest rates in 2024 by less than earlier expected. Its main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001.
The growing understanding that rates will stay higher for longer has pushed yields in the bond market up to their highest levels in more than a decade. That in turn makes investors less willing to pay high prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive or making their owners wait the longest for big growth.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.53 per cent from 4.44 per cent late Friday and is near its highest level since 2007. That’s up sharply from about 3.50 per cent in May and from 0.50 per cent about three years ago.
“Stocks digest gradual, growth driven increases in interest rates far better than rapid increases driven by other factors such as inflation or Fed policy,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a report.
Higher yields are at the head of a long line of concerns weighing on Wall Street. Not only have oil prices jumped by USD20 per barrel since June, economies around the world are looking shaky. The resumption of US student-loan repayments may also weaken what’s been the US economy’s greatest strength, spending by households.

In the near term, the US government may be set for another shutdown amid more political squabbles on Capitol Hill. But Wall Street has managed its way through previous shutdowns, and “history shows that past ones haven’t had much of an impact on the market,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
On Wall Street, Amazon rose 1.7 per cent and was the strongest single force pushing up on the S&P 500. The company announced an investment of up to USD4 billion in Anthropic, as it takes a minority stake in the artificial intelligence startup. It’s the latest Big Tech company to pour money into AI in the race to profit from opportunities that the latest generation of the technology is set to fuel.

Market experts said extended trading hours would assist in increasing capital formation by enabling more people from India to participate and attract foreign investors to invest and hedge their portfolios with equity F&O.
The proposed measure by the NSE to increase the trading time for the equity derivative segment will help market participants and retail investors.
In India, the equity and equity derivatives market close at 3.30 pm when most of the European equity markets would have just opened for trading while the US equity markets would be closed.
Indian investors, particularly the small ones, do not have access to markets in global jurisdictions. Such investors are not able to act when information or events take place outside the regular trading hours, which affect the Indian asset prices, particularly equity indices.
The longer trading hours in the offshore markets provide an opportunity to incorporate such information when onshore markets are closed.

This would help in onshore price discovery of Indian assets, and investors will get the opportunity to execute their views along with foreign investors when there is any news having an impact on any sector/industry or overall economy.
In 2018, the markets regulator allowed stock exchanges to set their trading hours in the equity derivatives segment between 9 am and 11.50 pm.

This was similar to the trading hours for the commodity derivatives segment, which are currently fixed between 10 am and 11.55 pm.

India’s Next Billion-Dollar Startup? Meet Chaitanya Laxman’s Laxcorp,"Chaitanya Laxman, a 25-year-old accomplished serial entrepreneur today unveiled his most ambitious venture yet, Laxcorp.","Chaitanya Laxman, a 25-year-old accomplished serial entrepreneur today unveiled his most ambitious venture yet, Laxcorp. Headquartered at WeWork Prestige Atlanta, Koramangala, Bangalore, Laxcorp is an AI company with a bold mission to ethically progress technology for empowerment and positive impact across industries.
“We are thrilled to officially launch Laxcorp and introduce our vision to proactively shape an inclusive, progressive future with responsible AI solutions. Our incredibly talented team gives us an invaluable foundation to maximise our contributions to society,” said Chaitanya.
The Driven Founder
Chaitanya brings years of expertise in founding startups, building enterprise products and leading engineering teams. At B2B SaaS provider TechLabs, Laxman pioneered innovations in learning management systems and enterprise integration, building it into a leader in its category. After a successful exit of a whopping ₹30.6Cr from TechLabs, Chaitanya stayed at LeadSquared, a billion-dollar SaaS company, to head its US Cloud initiatives. This record of consistently identifying emerging needs, developing category-defining products, and leading engineering teams put Chaitanya in the top tier of startup founders and technologists nationwide.

Now, he is channelling his expertise towards artificial intelligence, assembling a world-class team to build Laxcorp as innovators at the intersection of AI and SaaS. Building an All-Star Team
At Laxcorp, he has assembled a world-class team of AI PhDs, veteran product experts, and engineering leaders to match its bold vision of developing transformative AI for good. While small in size, the team packs a powerful punch when it comes to building innovative high-velocity products.
Heading up software engineering is Adittya, a veteran who honed his talents at RailYatri, Quincus and PlanSource, where he architected infrastructure supporting millions of users. Other team members include Indrajith, Sathwik who are ex-Gojek, and Goldman Sachs.
Leading Laxcorp’s elite team of data scientists is Narendra Babu, a Ph.D. from IIIT Hyderabad with an extensive academic background developing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Narendra is serving as a Chief Data Scientist at Laxcorp to build innovative AI solutions. “Our engineering team intimately understands how to construct secure systems that intelligently leverage data at a massive scale. Their backend expertise wonderfully complements our data science team,” explained Chaitanya.

Rounding out Laxcorp’s all-star team are product/UX expert Krishna Sil and product developer Vishal Soni. Sil previously collaborated with Chaitanya at TechLabs, managing design and product requirements that resulted in highly intuitive, user-centric interfaces. His deep understanding of customer needs will ensure that Laxcorp’s solutions are accessible to all. Vishal is a gifted developer experienced at rapidly bringing concepts to life as polished web applications. Together Krishna and Vishal instil Laxcorp’s offerings with human-centric design and seamless functionality.
Together, these engineering leaders bring over 30 years of collective experience in designing, building, and operating complex platforms at a massive scale. Their technical expertise will ensure that Laxcorp’s AI solutions can make the biggest real-world impact with velocity and reliability.
Chaitanya believes the team itself is Laxcorp’s secret weapon. “We’ve fostered an environment where exceptional individuals can invent freely. Their creativity is already generating groundbreaking innovations,” he added. Innovative Products Tackling Pressing Needs

Laxcorp is primed to deliver AI solutions that redefine what’s possible through products tackling four pressing needs:
Node0 helps developers overcome the challenge of securing applications by providing an intuitive API platform to easily integrate protections.
Nexus modernizes outdated recruitment practices by optimizing how companies evaluate and match candidates based on potential, not just credentials.
CiaraAI alleviates difficulties resolving issues in complex enterprise environments via natural language conversations and contextual responses.
TensorLearn tackles the growing tech skills gap by making hands-on education in emerging fields accessible.
The Time is Now for AI Innovation
When asked about the impetus behind launching now, Chaitanya explained: “There couldn’t have been a better time to innovate in the AI space. Every day we are seeing AI models becoming more and more efficient. Tech entrepreneurs around the globe are starting to build solid use cases around that technology. It’s exactly like what happened in the 90s when the internet, web browsing, and website indexing capabilities of search engines gave birth to companies like Google, and Amazon. The so-called “.com bubble”. Only this time it’s not a bubble. AI is here to stay and will change the very fundamentals of how software solves a problem. A lot of Enterprises are very appreciative of the cost-cutting capabilities (laughs) of AI and automation. For instance, the higher the number of support inquiries that can be fully automated by CiaraAI, the greater the cost reduction.” Studies show AI can automate 50-70% of routine support contacts. Enterprises with large, complex, and costly human support teams have greater room for efficiencies and cost savings. The deeper CiaraAI is integrated into the software systems, the more issues can be automated end-to-end. So, it’s safe to say that for a large enterprise, we estimate CiaraAI could likely reduce total customer support costs by 40-60%.”
Prioritising Product-Market Fit and Capitalising on Traction
When asked about fundraising plans, Chaitanya clarified: “We are not particularly worried about the investments as of now. We have enough capital to launch our products and already working with a bunch of pilot customers, as we speak. I personally believe in showing value in terms of traction, basically product market fit. Once PMF is sorted, it’s easier for a founder to bargain valuations on his terms, Investors are not going anywhere”.
He continued, “Our products prove AI, when developed thoughtfully, can massively benefit people, and enterprises – not just corporate profits. We passionately believe technology should serve humanity’s needs.”

Investments in Indian agri-tech startups fell 45% between FY22 and FY23: FSG Report,"Investments in Indian agri-tech startups fell by 45 per cent between 2021-22 and 2022-23 fiscal years, primarily due to a hike in global interest rates and heightened investor caution amid rising uncertainty, reveals consulting firm FSG's new report.","Investments in Indian agri-tech startups fell by 45 per cent between 2021-22 and 2022-23 fiscal years, primarily due to a hike in global interest rates and heightened investor caution amid rising uncertainty, reveals consulting firm FSG’s new report.
Meanwhile, global agri-tech investments declined by 10 per cent between calendar years 2022 and 2023, it said.
Going forward, FSG expects the funding slump to continue into FY24 before springing back in FY25. It expects that startups will continue focusing on profitability to tide over the next financial year.

“Investors are likely to continue being cautious and direct their limited funding towards established business models, such as follow-on funding for companies in the mid-stream agri-tech category,” it said.
Commenting on the trends identified by the firm, Rishi Agarwal, Managing Director, Head-Asia, FSG, said, “The shift in investment dynamics highlights the Indian agri-tech sector’s sensitivity to global economic trends. Startups must use periods of slower investment to refine their business models and drive towards profitability.” According to the report ‘India’s Unfolding Agri-Tech Story: Updates and Emerging Themes in India’s Agricultural Technology Sector’, India’s agri-tech sector witnessed its most successful year in terms of venture capital funding in 2021-22 financial year, followed by a significant decline in FY23 amid a global funding slowdown.
While the number of investment deals rose from 121 in FY22 to 140 in FY23, the total funding raised by agri-tech startups in India fell from USD 1,279 million in FY22 to USD 706 million in FY23, it said.
While FY22 witnessed a boom in agri-tech startup investments, which drove startup valuations to unprecedented heights, the correction in FY23 has led to a more prudent investment climate, it added.

Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel Graced The Indian Express Online Media’s Summit MANTHAN At Raipur,"On Monday (September 18, 2023), Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel attended the ‘Jansatta Manthan’, a program of ‘Jansatta’, an enterprise of ‘The Indian Express Group.","Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2023: There are a few months left for the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel is presenting the report card of his tenure from different forums. On Monday ( September 18), the Chief Minister attended ‘Jansatta Manthan’, a program of ‘Jansatta’, an enterprise of ‘The Indian Express Group.
In the ‘Jansatta Manthan’ organized in the state capital Raipur, editor Vijay Kumar Jha asked Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel that the Congress has set a target of crossing 75 for itself. The opposition BJP says that the Congress has gradually started following our agenda (Hindutva). The question arises that if Congress has done development, then what is the need to fight elections on the issue of Hindutva?”
In response to this question, the Chief Minister said, “I am from Chhattisgarh, so I should be proud to be a Chhattisgarhi.” In 15 years of rule, they (BJP) made them feel that Chhattisgarhis are the most inferiority complex. But we worked to respect the dialect, food, lifestyle and festival of Chhattisgarh. We declared a holiday for International Tribal Day. … Is this all about Hindutva? This is about the culture of Chhattisgarh.”

Then what is ‘temple construction’ and ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’?
The next question of Vijay Kumar Jha, editor of Jansatta.com, was whether the construction of the temple was being done by the Chhattisgarh government, the Ram Van Gaman Path project, etc. have nothing to do with Hindutva?
In response to this question, the Chief Minister explained the difference between BJP’s Ram and his own Ram. “It is believed that Lord Ram spent the maximum time here (Chattisgarh). We are developing the routes that Lord Ram walked during his exile from the point of view of tourism. At a distance of 15 km from here (Raipur) is the ancient temple of Kaushalya Mata (mother of Rama). It is the only temple (of Kaushalya) in the world. The Bharatiya Janata Party got a chance for 15 years. It is the village of Ramesh Bais (Governor of Maharashtra). But he never paid attention to decorating this temple.But we did. Such as the Rajiv Lochan Temple, the Shri Narayan Temple, the Shabri Mata Temple… There are very ancient temples but no attention was paid to developing them. Now if we have done the work of decorating these temples, then what is wrong in it. You had a chance. But you just kept asking people for votes in the name of Ayodhya temple. You kept asking for votes in the name of cows. But he never served the cow.”
The CM further said, “There are Ram kothis in our village. Never think about this. But we are working. All this is the heritage of Chhattisgarh. Ram works to get votes for them. Their Ram can do the work of getting notes. Our Ram is Vanvasi Ram. Our Ram is Shabari’s Ram. Our Ram is the Ram of the working people. Our Ram is Kaushalya’s Ram. Because Kaushalya is the daughter here, bhancha ram is for us.”

CM explains the difference between Bajrang Dal and Bajrang Bali

On behalf of the Congress in Karnataka, it was said that if our government comes to power, we will ban Bajrang Dal. Vijay Kumar Jha wanted to know from Bhupesh Baghel what he thinks about this.
“Children remember Bajrang Bali because they want to be strong. Those who are devotees remember Bajrangbali because there is no bigger devotee than him. Knowledgeable people remember Bajrangbali because they also consider him as their ideal. But these Bajrangi (Bajrang Dal) are different from Bajrang Bali. Their job is only to kill, beat and rob. Bajrangbali is different. Bajrang Dal is different. ”
Along with this, the Chief Minister also made it clear that there is no need to ban Bajrang Dal. CM Baghel believes that Bajrang Dal has done as much polarization on religious grounds as it could, it won’t be able to do it now.
“Money is in people’s hands.”

The Chief Minister claims that the income of farmers has increased under his government. “Our government made farmers stand on their feet,” the CM said from the stage of Jansatta Manthan. From loan waiver, providing electricity at cheaper rates and waiving irrigation tax, steps have been taken. The BJP had promised to implement the Swaminathan Commission report, double the income of farmers, but all that did not happen. Farmers were constantly committing suicide. So we decided to buy paddy crop for Rs. 2500. This brought about a big change in the lives of farmers. Chhattisgarh at present is 40% forest, so there is a lot of forest produce. Earlier, there was no purchase system and/or support price however, people did the work. Regardless of the produce, arrangements were made to purchase it. Earlier, 7 types of minor forest produce were purchased, but now 67 types of minor forest produce are being procured. We are adding value to it. Earlier, tendu leaves were purchased at the rate of Rs. 2500 per standard sack and, it is now bought at the rate of Rs. 4000 per standard sack. Our government has also come up with the Godhan Nyay Yojana. This brought money into people’s hands. Today, there has been a change in the income of the people of Chhattisgarh.”
“One crore people benefited from haat-bazaar clinic scheme”
When Chhattisgarh was formed, 40 percent of the people were below the poverty line. 41 percent of the people were malnourished. More than 15 percent of women aged 47 to 49 years were anemic. For this, we launched the Mukhyamantri Suposhan Yojana. Arranged for food on an empty stomach. Along with this, he also arranged for treatment and started the Haat-Bazar Clinic Scheme. So far, more than one crore people have taken advantage of it.

Chhattisgarh alone accounts for 75 per cent of the total small forest produce procured in the country. Earlier, the rate of mahua in the market used to be 16-17 rupees. The government started buying mahua at Rs 40. Now the rate of mahua in the market has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. When we started purchasing coarse grains. When the support price was given, the area of coarse grains increased. In this way, the government is directly supporting.

“Crude oil prices have started the week on the front foot, as the market continues to digest Russia’s temporary ban on diesel and gasoline exports, into an already tight market, offset with the Fed’s hawkish message that rates will stay higher for longer,” IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore said.
Both contracts fell last week, snapping a three-week winning streak, after a hawkish Federal Reserve stance rattled global financial sectors and raised oil demand concerns.
Prices had rallied more than 10% in the previous three weeks on forecasts of a wide crude supply deficit in the fourth quarter after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended additional supply cuts to the end of the year.
Last week, Moscow temporarily banned gasoline and diesel exports to most countries in order to stabilise the domestic market, fanning concerns of low products supply especially for heating oil as the Northern Hemisphere heads into winter.

"New eastern route to Russia to handle rising cargo shipments between the two countries, two new hubs to counter transshipment: Sonowal","""We will surely have to compete in the regional and global maritime sector. And it has to be done with a long-term vision. This is not just about the next 10 to 20 years but goes much beyond that,"" says Union Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal.","Much of the cargo traffic that comes into India is transshipped through major hubs such as Colombo, Singapore, Jabel Ali or Port Klang. In an interaction with Sukalp Sharma and Anil Sasi, Union Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal said the government is cognisant of this issue and is building international transshipment ports like Galathea Bay and Wadhavan ports to tackle the problem. He said the upcoming global maritime summit would give a fillip to investments in the ports and shipping sector and that his Ministry was actively charting out a new route to Russia through the east to handle rising cargo shipments between the two countries. Edited excerpts:
The dismantling of the TAMP (Tariff Authority for Major Ports) and the delegation of freedom to major ports to set tariffs has been a major reform. Which is the next big ticket reform push that the government is working on for the ports sector?
Global players are now recognising India’s potential as a maritime country and are also interested in the huge market that the country offers in the form of 1.4 billion people. There is no doubt about India’s potential and it is our responsibility to channel and realise that potential.

"Under Centre’s Agro Processing Clusters scheme — only 2 out of 70 projects complete, at least 30 running behind schedule","According to the report, major reasons for delays were due to processes related to change of land use and sanction of term loans.","Just two out of 70 projects approved under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries’ Agro Processing Clusters (APC) scheme are complete and operational as per latest government figures accessed by The Indian Express. The APC scheme was in the news earlier this month when a political controversy erupted over the scheme allegedly benefiting Pride East Entertainments, a company related to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma’s wife.
A total of 17 projects have completed building the core processing and basic enabling infrastructure but do not yet meet the requirement of operationalising at least 5 food processing units in the cluster. Of the remaining 51 projects under implementation, 30 are running behind the stipulated time schedule. Incidentally, the APC scheme is a modified version of the ministry’s Mega Food Parks (MFP) scheme, which was discontinued in 2021 as it “could not achieve” its desired outcomes. According to the ministry, delays in projects in the revamped APC scheme include time-consuming processes like change of land use, clearances from pollution control boards, sanction of term loan by lending bank/financial institutions, and Covid related delays.

"Deadline to add nominees for mutual fund investors, demat account holders ends on Sep 30","FYERS' Tejas Khoday said that investors can nominate up to three beneficiaries for their demat account, either online or offline. They can also change or cancel their nomination at any time.","All individual demat account holders and mutual fund investors have time till September 30, to nominate a beneficiary or opt out of it by submitting a declaration form, failing which their demat accounts and folios will be frozen, and they will not be able to redeem their investments.
This mandate applies to both new as well as existing investors, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The move is aimed at helping investors to secure their assets and pass them on to their legal heirs.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This will ensure smooth and hassle-free transfer of securities to the legal heirs of the investors in case of any unfortunate event,” Tejas Khoday, co-founder and CEO at FYERS, said.
Under Sebi’s rule, new investors must either nominate their securities or formally opt out of nomination through a declaration form when opening trading and demat accounts.
For existing investors, including jointly-held mutual fund folios, failing to meet this deadline will result in the freezing of folios for debits. Further, investors’ demat accounts or mutual funds folios will be frozen and inaccessible until they nominate or declare opt-out.
Feroze Azeez, Deputy CEO at Anand Rathi Wealth, said Sebi’s recent move to set a deadline of September 30, 2023, for all individual demat account holders and mutual fund investors to nominate their securities is a significant and commendable step.
ADVERTISEMENT
In July 2021, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had asked all existing eligible trading and demat account holders to provide choice of nomination on or before March 31, 2022, failing which the trading and demat accounts would have been frozen for debits.
Later, this was extended by one more year till March 31, 2023.
With regards to mutual fund unitholders, the regulator in its circular on June 15, 2022, made it mandatory for mutual fund subscribers to submit the nomination details or declaration to opt out of the nomination on or after August 1, 2022. Later, the deadline was extended to October 1, 2022, and again till March 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
Based on representations received from the market participants, it was decided that the provision of freezing of folios and demat accounts, will come to force with effect from September 30, 2023, instead of March 31, 2023.
Market experts are of the view that many investment accounts in the past have been opened without nominating anyone to whom the assets should be transmitted in case something happens to the account holders.
This means that the rightful heirs had difficulty in getting the assets transmitted to them due to the hassles of different kinds of documentation requirements.
Explaining Sebi’s rationale, Azeez said the initiative is crucial because it emphasises the importance of proper financial planning and safeguarding investments in the event of an investor’s untimely demise. By adding nominees to their folios, investors are ensuring that their investments will smoothly pass on to their chosen beneficiaries.
“The deadline serves as a proactive measure to protect investors’ interests and provide them with the peace of mind that their investments will benefit their loved ones as intended. Overall, this move by Sebi promotes responsible financial management and secures the future of investors and their families, making it a significant and commendable regulatory action,” he added.

"FPIs outflow in equities crosses Rs 10,000 cr mark in Sep on rising US interest rates","Before the outflow, FPIs were incessantly buying Indian equities in the last six months from March to August and brought in Rs 1.74 lakh crore during the period.","Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have pulled out over Rs 10,000 crore from Indian equities in the first three weeks of September, primarily due to rising US interest rates, recessionary fears, and overvalued domestic stocks.
Before the outflow, FPIs were incessantly buying Indian equities in the last six months from March to August and brought in Rs 1.74 lakh crore during the period.
Mayank Mehra, smallcase, manager and principal partner at Craving Alpha, believes that strong economic growth prospects, attractive valuations, and government reforms could support foreign investment flows in the next month.
“Since valuations remain high even after the recent pullback and US bond yields are attractive (the US 10-year bond yield is around 4.49 per cent) FPIs are likely to press sales so long as this trend persists,” V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the data with depositories, in the 15 trading days, so far in September, FPIs were sellers in 11 days with a net withdrawal of Rs 10,164 crore.
This figure includes bulk deals and investments through the primary market.
Of the total pullout of Rs 10,164 crore so far this month (till September 22), over Rs 4,700 crore was withdrawn in the last week alone.
The latest outflow came after FPI investment in equities hit a four-month low of Rs 12,262 crore in August.
FPI flows have displayed a subdued pattern over the past few weeks. This hesitancy among investors can be attributed to growing apprehensions about inflation and the interest rate landscape, particularly in the US, coupled with uncertainties regarding global economic growth, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar India, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
As a result, investors have turned cautious and adopted a “wait and watch” approach when considering investments in emerging markets like India, he added.
“Higher oil prices and elevated US yields are keeping the FPIs on the defensive, however, we infer that stable economic growth in India vis-à-vis China and other emerging markets (EMs) will draw FPIs back to the Indian equities,” Hitesh Jain, Strategist Institutional Equities Research at YES Securities India said.
On the other hand, FPIs invested Rs 295 crore in the country’s debt market during the period under review.
With this, the total investment by FPIs in equity has reached Rs 1.25 lakh crore and close to Rs 28,476 crore in the debt market this year so far.

India can aim for 8-fold expansion of economy; MDBs have last chance to address global issues: Lawrence Summers,"When asked whether new MDBs could be formed especially to deal with issues such as climate change, Summers said his advice to the existing multilateral institutions would be to move dramatically in that direction.","A combination of free market forces addressing energy-related infrastructure needs, questions of reform in a number of key states, and supporting a more effective public sector could generate an eight-fold expansion in India’s economy by 2050 with an annual growth rate of 8 per cent, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Saturday.

India’s imports of Saudi oil in September slump to a multi-year low,"Currently, Saudi Arabia is the third-biggest supplier of crude oil to India, behind Russia, the top supplier, and Iraq. Traditionally, Riyadh used to be New Delhi’s second-biggest source of crude after Baghdad.","India’s oil imports from Saudi Arabia in September slumped to a multi-year low of around 5,00,000 barrels per day (bpd), most likely due to Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) impending maintenance shutdown of some units at its Jamnagar refinery complex and Saudi Arabian crudes becoming relatively more expensive than competing grades in the wake of production cuts by Riyadh, according to commodity market analytics and intelligence firm Kpler.
So far in September, India’s oil imports from Saudi Arabia have averaged at 4,99,688 bpd, the lowest since November of 2014, as per Kpler data.

The court’s order comes after pleas filed by former directors of a company challenging the LOC issued against them at the instance of Bank of Baroda in connection with a loan default by the company after the company’s loan account was declared a non-performing asset by the bank.
A single-judge bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad held in its September 19 order– “The right to travel abroad is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India which cannot be taken away in an arbitrary and illegal manner. This court is now coming across a large number of cases where banks are now insisting on opening of LOCs only as a measure for recovery of money without initiating any criminal proceedings.”

The court said banks can request for opening of LOCs in “exceptional circumstances” when it is felt that permission by the person to go abroad will affect the “economy of the country”.
Observing that LOCs cannot be opened merely on the request of banks, the HC said, “There has to be some application of mind by the authority concerned which is opening the LOCs, since opening of this circular results in restraining a person’s right to travel abroad. The authority opening the LOC must satisfy itself that the departure of a person against whom the circular has been opened would be detrimental to the sovereignty or security or integrity of India…”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/lookout-circular-quashed-delhi-high-court-frowns-on-its-use-by-banks-to-recover-money-8952196/,business
"Inclusion of Indian bonds in JP Morgan index to widen investor base, may boost rupee: CEA",He also said there is potential for currency appreciation following inclusion of Indian bonds in JP Morgan index.,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran on Friday said inclusion of Indian government bonds into JP Morgan’s benchmark emerging market index from next year will widen investor base, and may lead to appreciation of rupee.
He also said there is potential for currency appreciation following inclusion of Indian bonds in JP Morgan index.
Global financial firm JP Morgan has said that it plans to include Indian government bonds or government securities (G-Secs) into its benchmark emerging market index from June, 2024, a move that will bring down borrowing cost for the government.
ADVERTISEMENT
The inclusion of G-Secs will be staggered over a 10-month period from June 28, 2024 to March 31, 2025, indicating one per cent increment on its index weight.
“Obviously, the investor base for Indian government bonds widens and it will also in a way, relieve the Indian financial institutions from having to be one of the biggest buyers or subscribers of government bonds and they can actually then lend that money for more productive purposes to private sector, the commercial sector individuals etc,” Nageswaran told reporters.
Replying to a question, he said there will be a tendency for the currency to appreciate just as it happened between 2003 and 2008 when capital inflows into India surged.

"Household debt doubles in FY23, savings more than halves to 5.15% of GDP","The net financial savings of households plunged by close to 55 per cent in FY23 to 5.1 per cent of GDP, and their indebtedness more than doubled to Rs 15.6 lakh crore from FY21, primarily led by massive borrowings from banks, shows an analysis of latest official numbers.","The net financial savings of households plunged by close to 55 per cent in FY23 to 5.1 per cent of GDP, and their indebtedness more than doubled to Rs 15.6 lakh crore from FY21, primarily led by massive borrowings from banks, shows an analysis of latest official numbers.
According to SBI Research, a good portion of the drawdown from savings have gone to physical assets and of the Rs 8.2 lakh crore increase in household indebtedness in FY23, as much as Rs 7.1 lakh crore accounted for bank borrowings, primarily for home loans and other retail finances.
In FY23, household savings plunged to 5.1 per cent of GDP, from 11.5 per cent in FY21, a 50-year low, and 7.6 per cent in FY20, which was not the pandemic period.
ADVERTISEMENT
It can be noted that the most important source of funds for the two deficit sectors — general government finances and the non-financial corporations, are household savings.
The household sector in the national accounts includes, apart from individuals, all non-government, non-corporate enterprises like farm and non-farm businesses, unincorporated establishments like sole proprietorships and partnerships and non-profit institutions.
According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India, financial liabilities jumped by Rs 8.2 lakh crore since the pandemic, outpacing the increase in gross financial savings of Rs 6.7 lakh crore.
On the asset side of households, there was an increase of Rs 4.1 lakh crore in insurance and provident funds and pension funds during the period.
On the liability side of the households, of the Rs 8.2 lakh crore increase, as much as Rs 7.1 lakh crore accounted for an increase in household borrowings from commercial banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
When juxtaposed this increase in borrowings from banks with the increase in bank credit, as much as 55 per cent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchases.
According to Ghosh, this is possible due to the low interest rate regime, resulting in a paradigm shift of household financial savings to household physical savings in the last two years.
He sees a significant long-run relationship between housing loans and households’ savings in physical assets. As a result, the decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets.
ADVERTISEMENT
In fact, savings in physical assets, which accounted for more than two-thirds of household savings in FY12, had declined to 48 per cent in FY21.
However, the trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach 70 per cent in FY23, due to a decline in share of financial assets.
Ghosh also believes that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices.
Meanwhile, the household debt-to-GDP ratio has increased during the pandemic but has declined thereafter. The household debt as percentage of GDP was at 40.7 in March 2020, and has then fallen to 36.5 in June 2023.
Over the years, 80-90 per cent of household physical savings were in dwellings, other buildings and structures and rest in machinery and equipment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/household-debt-doubles-fy23-savings-more-than-halves-gdp-8950080/,business
DGCA implements watch duty time limitation norms for air traffic controllers at 57 airports,"In a ""significant"" move, DGCA said regulations for watch duty time limitations and rest requirements for air traffic controllers have been implemented at 57 airports, including Amritsar, Coimbatore, Patna and Imphal.","In a “significant” move, aviation watchdog DGCA on Thursday said regulations for watch duty time limitations and rest requirements for air traffic controllers have been implemented at 57 airports, including Amritsar, Coimbatore, Patna and Imphal.
The implementation of the norms will ensure that air traffic controllers will get adequate rest while carrying out their duties.
The regulations regarding ‘Watch Duty Time Limitation (WDTL) and rest requirements for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs)’ are being implemented at the 57 airports from Thursday, DGCA said in a release.

"‘No distress’, people investing in other fin products: Finance Ministry on dip in household savings","Net household savings declined to a 47-year low of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product in FY23 as compared to 7.2 per cent recorded in the previous year, as per the data released by the Reserve Bank in its latest monthly bulletin.","The finance ministry on Thursday dismissed the criticism over the impact of declining household savings on the economy, saying people are investing in different financial products and “there is no distress”.
The statement posted on X by the ministry brushed aside critical voices raised with regard to the decadal fall in household savings and its overall effect on the economy.
“Lately, critical voices have been raised w.r.t. to household savings and its overall effect on the economy. However, data indicates that changing consumer preference for different financial products is the real reason for the household savings and there is no distress as is being circulated in some circles,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Net household savings declined to a 47-year low of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product in FY23 as compared to 7.2 per cent recorded in the previous year, as per the data released by the Reserve Bank in its latest monthly bulletin.
At the same time, annual financial liabilities of households rose sharply by 5.8 per cent of GDP compared with 3.8 per cent in 2021-22.
Defending the position, the finance ministry said, the Stock of Household Gross Financial Assets went up by 37.6 per cent, and the Stock of Household Gross Financial Liabilities went up by 42.6 per cent between June 2020 and March 2023, no big difference between the two.
“Households added Net Financial Assets of 22.8 lakh crore in FY21, nearly 17 lakh crore in FY22 and 13.8 lakh crore in FY23. So, they added less financial assets to their portfolio than in the previous year and the year before, but it is important to note that their overall net financial assets are still growing,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
They added financial assets by a lesser magnitude than in the previous years because they have now started taking loans to buy real assets such as homes, it said.
“RBI data on personal loans provides us with evidence. Personal loans given by banks have several components. Key among them are real estate loans and vehicle loans. Both are collateralised. These two constitute 62 per cent of the overall personal loans by the banking sector. The other big categories are other personal loans and credit card loans,” it said.
Pointing out that there has been a steady double-digit growth in loans for housing since May 2021, it said, “so, financial liabilities have been incurred to buy real assets. Vehicle loans have been growing at double digits (y/y) since April 2022 and more than 20% (y/y) since September 2022. The household sector is not in distress, clearly. They are buying vehicles and homes on mortgages.” Overall household savings (current prices) – which include financial, physical and jewellery – has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.2 per cent between 2013-14 and 2021-22 (8 years) and the nominal GDP has grown at a CAGR of 9.65 per cent during the same period, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
It further said, households added net financial assets of Rs 13.8 lakh crore in FY23 compared to nearly Rs 17 lakh crore the year before and Rs 22.8 lakh crore in FY21.
The biggest item that seems to have swung it is the net flow of credit from Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFC) to the Household Sector, which includes unincorporated enterprises, it said.
NBFC had lent nearly Rs 2,40,000 crore in FY23 as compared to Rs 21,400 crore in the previous year to the household sector, it said, adding, that is a whopping 11.2 times and that has set off alarm bells as commentators forgot that these are ‘flow’ numbers.
Overall, NBFC retail loans outstanding were Rs 8.12 lakh crore in FY22, and it went up to Rs 10.5 lakh crore in FY23, a growth of ‘only’ 29.6 per cent, it said.
“The two big components in NBFC retail loans are vehicle loans and ‘other retail loans’. Vehicle loan outstanding increased by about 12.5 per cent, from Rs 3.4 lakh crore in FY22 to Rs 3.82 lakh crore in FY23. Other retail loans went up from Rs 3.95 lakh crore to Rs 5.22 lakh crore. These are microfinance loans, loans to Self-Help Groups, Advances to individuals against gold and other loans,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
So, it said, 36 per cent of NBFC’s outstanding retail loans are for the purchase of vehicles and that is not a sign of distress on the part of households but of confidence in their future employment and income prospects.
That has been amply brought out in the recent Consumer Confidence Survey of RBI, and the C-Voter Survey of Consumer Optimism conducted in July and August, respectively, it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/people-investing-other-finance-products-finmin-household-savings-dip-8949904/,business

India to clock 6.5% GDP growth in FY24 despite high crude oil prices: NITI Aayog member,"The Indian economy will grow at around 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal, notwithstanding high crude oil prices and increased uncertainty due climate changes, NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani said on Thursday.","The Indian economy will grow at around 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal, notwithstanding high crude oil prices and increased uncertainty due climate changes, NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani said on Thursday.
Virmani also asserted that the gross household savings ratio in India has consistently gone up.
In an interview with PTI, he said: “My growth projection (of India’s GDP growth) is 6.5 per cent plus minus 0.5 per cent… because my experience is that the fluctuations in global GDP more or less has balanced out for us, assuming normal changes.” On some US-based economists’ claim that India is overstating economic growth, Virmani said he has noticed that certain former officials don’t have any idea how GDP is constructed as they have come from academic background.
ADVERTISEMENT
Last week, the Finance Ministry also dismissed the criticism of inflated GDP, saying it has followed the consistent practice of using the income side estimates to compute economic growth, and stressed many international agencies have revised upwards their forecast after seeing the first quarter data.
The critics, the ministry had said, should have looked at other data like purchasing managers’ indices, bank credit growth, increase in capital expenditure and consumption patterns to assess the growth.
India’s GDP growth in 2022-23 was 7.2 per cent, lower than 9.1 per cent in 2021-22. According to Reserve Bank of India’s projections, India’s GDP is likely to grow at 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal year.
The eminent economist noted that the risk for India is “crude oil prices”.
ADVERTISEMENT
“.. if we look back 10 years ago… Saudi Arabia and the USA were more or less on the same geopolitical platform, and they used to coordinate things… but that has changed in the last five years,” Virmani said.
International crude oil prices have breached the USD 90 per barrel mark for the first time in 10 months and are currently hovering around USD 92 per barrel.
“Recently, we have seen that it (Saudi Arabia) cut down on oil production when oil prices started going to reasonable levels, and so did Russia.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Virmani, the issue of El Nino conditions has come up again and the uncertainty has increased because of climate change.
Responding to a question on falling household savings to five-decade low, Virmani said the net household saving is falling down, not the gross household savings.
“The gross household savings ratio has consistently gone up. The net household savings ratio is going down because consumer debt is increasing faster,” he said.
Asked whether the fall of net household savings is a matter of concern, Virmani noted that every economist who writes on macroeconomics said that the debt-to-GDP ratio in India is way too low.
“They have compared India with every country in the world, and they keep telling you that there’s a huge scope for increasing debt-to-GDP ratio in India,” he observed.
ADVERTISEMENT
He noted that “the debt-to-GDP ratio for households in the country is not too high or unsustainable.” Responding to a question on high inflation, the eminent economist said the rise in crude oil prices will have some inflationary impact.
“Because inherently the income of the people goes down. So again, (regarding rise in) oil prices, we cannot do anything in the short-term, except manage it,” he opined.
ADVERTISEMENT
Virmani emphasised that as far as food inflation is concerned, the government has managed it reasonably well.
Retail inflation declined to 6.83 per cent in August after touching a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July, mainly due to softening prices of vegetables, but still remains above the Reserve Bank’s comfort zone.

Meanwhile, India’s real GDP growth was 7.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in Q1 FY24, as per the Income or Production Approach.
Recently, former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, in an article, argued that India’s GDP is not measured from the expenditure side rather than the productivity side.
Earlier this month, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran rejected criticism of “statistical discrepancy” in the first quarter GDP data, saying when the same statistical authority reported the severest contraction in the first quarter of 2020, the naysayers had called it credible as it suited their narrative.

With regards to women’s participation in the workforce, the report stated that after the coronavirus pandemic, 60 per cent of women were self-employed as compared to 50 per cent before the pandemic.
While this indicates an increase in women’s workforce participation, it was accompanied by a decline in self-employment earnings, which in 2022 were only 85 per cent of what they were in the first quarter of 2019 reflecting the impact of distress induced by the pandemic.

EPFO records highest net member addition of 18.75 lakh in July,Gender-wise analysis of payroll data shows that during July 2023 around 3.86 lakh net female members have been added to the payroll.,"Retirement fund body EPFO has recorded the highest net member addition of 18.75 lakh in July 2023, according to the payroll data released on Wednesday.
The labour ministry in a statement said that the addition of 18.75 lakh during the month is the highest since the first publishing of EPFO payroll data from April 2018 covering the period of September 2017 onwards.
A growing trend has continued for the last three months with an increase of around 85,932 net members over the previous month of June 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
The data indicates that around 10.27 lakh new members have enrolled during July 2023 which is the highest since July 2022.
The majority of new members joining EPFO are in the age group of 18-25 years constituting roughly 58.45 per cent of total new members additions during the month. This shows an increasing trend in youth enrollment, who are mostly first-time job seekers joining the organized sector workforce of the country, it explained.
The payroll data demonstrates that approximately 12.72 lakh members exited but rejoined EPFO, which is the highest in the last 12 months.
These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, extending their social security protection.

Gender-wise analysis of payroll data shows that during July 2023 around 3.86 lakh net female members have been added to the payroll.

Around 2.75 lakh female members have come under the ambit of social security coverage for the first time.
State-wise analysis of payroll data denotes that net member addition is the highest in the five states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat and Haryana.
ADVERTISEMENT
These states constitute around 58.78 per cent of net member addition, adding a total of 11.02 lakh members during the month.
Of all the states, Maharashtra is leading by adding 20.45 per cent of net members during the month.
Month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays significant growth in the members working in establishments engaged in Trading-Commercial Establishments, Building & Construction Industry, Electrical, Mechanical and General Engineering Products.
This was followed by Textiles, Financing Establishment, Hospitals etc.
Of the total net membership, around 38.40 per cent addition is from expert services (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc).
The above payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee records is a continuous process. The previous data hence gets updated every month.

From the month of April 2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period from September 2017 onwards.

Goldman Sachs pays Rs 26.44 lakh to settle FPI guidelines violation case with Sebi,Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte has settled with Sebi a case pertaining to certain discrepancies in the monthly offshore derivative instruments reporting after paying Rs 26.44 lakh towards the settlement amount.,"Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte has settled with capital markets regulator Sebi a case pertaining to certain discrepancies in the monthly ODI (offshore derivative instruments) reporting after paying Rs 26.44 lakh towards the settlement amount.
The order came after Goldman Sachs, a registered Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) which deals in off-shore derivative instruments, proposed to settle the alleged violations by “neither admitting nor denying” under the settlement rules.
“It is hereby ordered that any proceedings that may be initiated for the violations… are settled in respect of the applicant (Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte),” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a settlement order passed on Monday.

In its order, the regulator observed that certain discrepancies in the monthly ODI reporting for the month of March 2022 were identified by the applicant.
These were related to a mismatch of investment managers for multi-managed clients with respect to four ODI subscribers and updated details of investment managers or beneficial owners information of three ODI subscribers were not provided in the monthly ODI reporting.
Through this, Goldman Sachs allegedly violated rules concerning operational guidelines for FPIs.
Goldman Sachs submitted the correct and updated data to Sebi in its monthly reports for the period March 2022 to January 2023. Thereafter, it filed the present application for the purpose of settling the enforcement proceedings that may be initiated against it for non-compliance with operational guidelines for FPIs.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/goldman-sachs-pays-sebi-settle-fpi-guidelines-violation-case-8948582/,business

"Investors adopt cautious stance; debt mutual funds log Rs 25,872 crore outflow in August","Out of 16 debt categories, nine of them witnessed net outflows during the month under review, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed.","After witnessing staggering inflow in July, debt-oriented mutual fund schemes saw a withdrawal of Rs 25,872 crore last month as investors continue to adopt a cautious stance amid the current interest rate scenario in the US.
Out of 16 debt categories, nine of them witnessed net outflows during the month under review, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed.
The major quantum of net outflows was witnessed by the categories having less than one year duration profile such as liquid, ultra short and low duration. Additionally, the banking and PSU category also witnessed significant net outflows.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the data, debt mutual funds witnessed an outflow of Rs 25,872 crore in August as compared to a net inflow of Rs 61,440 crore in the preceding month.
“Given the current interest rate scenario and uncertainty over the direction of interest rates in the country, it appears that many investors continue to adopt a cautious stance and wait for further indication on interest rates to make investment decisions. Also, a rally in the equity markets could have also prompted investors to shift their focus from debt to equity,” Melvyn Santarita, Analyst – Manager Research at Morningstar India, said.
The huge outflow has pulled down the assets under management (AUM) of fixed income funds or debt funds to Rs 14 lakh crore at the end of August from Rs 14.17 lakh crore in the preceding month-end.
In terms of categories, liquid funds saw an outflow of Rs 26,824 crore, followed by ultra short duration funds (Rs 4,123 crore) and banking and PSU funds (Rs 985 crore.) On the other hand, there was another section of investors who chose to take some risk. Anticipating a change in the interest rate cycle, a section of investors invested in categories like Gilt Funds, Dynamic Bond Funds, and Long Duration Funds, which stands to benefit if the interest rate cycle reverses, he said.

“As and when there is more clarity on the start of the interest rate cut cycle, these categories may witness enhanced flows. These funds carry relatively high interest rate risks and hence investors should bear that in mind while taking exposure in them,” he added.
Overnight fund attracted Rs 3,158 crore, floater fund saw an inflow to the tune of Rs 2,325 crore, corporate bond fund logged in Rs 1,755 crore and gilt fund (Rs 255 crore).

"UK inflation unexpectedly falls, raising questions about BoE rates plan","The Office for National Statistics said the fall was driven by a drop in hotel prices and air fares, which are often volatile, and by food prices rising by less than at the same time last year.","Britain’s high inflation rate unexpectedly fell in August, official data showed on Wednesday, raising questions about how much higher the Bank of England will take interest rates a day before its next policy announcement.
The consumer price index dropped to 6.7% from July’s 6.8%, confounding forecasts by economists polled by Reuters – and the BoE – for an increase.
The surprise drop in the inflation rate to its lowest since February 2022 pushed sterling to its lowest against the U.S. dollar since May. The pound also fell against the euro as investors scaled back bets on future rate hikes by the BoE.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Office for National Statistics said the fall was driven by a drop in hotel prices and air fares, which are often volatile, and by food prices rising by less than at the same time last year.
That offset a jump in fuel prices and an increase in a tax on alcoholic drinks.
The BoE said last month that it expected inflation in August would rise to 7.1% before falling sharply to around 5% in October which would still be more than double its 2% target.
Investors had expected the BoE to raise interest rates for the 15th time in a row on Thursday, taking Bank Rate to 5.5% from 5.25%.
ADVERTISEMENT
That looked much less certain in light of the inflation data. Investors put a roughly 45% chance on the BoE pausing its run of rate hikes on Thursday, up from about 20% before the inflation figures were published.
Core inflation – which strips out volatile food and energy prices – fell by more than the headline rate to 6.2% from 6.9% in July. The Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 6.8% in August.
Price growth in Britain’s service sector, which is also being closed watched by the BoE, also lost some of its steam as it slowed to 6.8% from 7.4% in July.
ADVERTISEMENT
As well as providing some relief to the BoE, which has come under criticism after inflation surpassed 11% last October, the latest figures were welcomed by the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. He has promised to halve inflation this year before an election expected in 2024.
“Today’s news shows the plan to deal with inflation is working – plain and simple,” finance minister Jeremy Hunt said.
“But it is still too high which is why it is all the more important to stick to our plan to halve it so we can ease the pressure on families and businesses. It is also the only path to sustainably higher growth.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/uk-inflation-unexpectedly-falls-bank-of-england-rates-plan-8948127/,business

TRAI recommended the merging of FBG and PBG for Mobile Number Portability license, into a single Bank Guarantee, and favoured submission of electronic bank guarantee (eBG) for ease of doing business.
“In an environment of rapid technological transformation in the telecommunications sector, in order to facilitate the orderly growth of the telecom sector and Ease of Doing Business, TRAI has made recommendations to the Government for reducing the entry fees across various license authorisations and the merging of bank guarantees,” TRAI said. TRAI said the reduction in entry fee is expected to lead to the entry of new service providers in the market, increase investment and enhance competition in telecom sector. The merging of bank guarantees will encourage ease of doing business and enable licensees to make investments in the sector thereby ushering the growth in the sector.
Both these measures will improve the quality of service and enhance consumer welfare, TRAI said. “The Authority has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of license. Such a move will ease the financial burden on existing, as well as new entrants, and will be beneficial for UL (VNO) licensees especially,” it explained.

In the telecom licences parlance, Entry Fee is a fixed one-time amount that prospective entrants must pay to enter a market. Entry Fees are typically non-refundable and constitute start-up costs for a firm.

Gas price for Reliance to be reduced by 14% from next month,"For the six-month period starting October 1, the price of gas from deepsea and high-pressure, high-temperature (HPTP) areas is likely to be cut to around $10.4 per million British thermal unit from the current $12.12, reported PTI quoting sources.","The price of natural gas produced from difficult areas like KG-D6 of Reliance Industries is likely to be cut by about 14 per cent from next month in line with softening energy prices, sources said.
For the six-month period starting October 1, the price of gas from deepsea and high-pressure, high-temperature (HPTP) areas is likely to be cut to around USD 10.4 per million British thermal unit from the current USD 12.12, they said.
The government bi-annually fixes prices of the locally-produced natural gas — which is converted into CNG for use in automobiles, piped to household kitchens for cooking and used to generate electricity and make fertilisers.
ADVERTISEMENT
Two different formulas govern rates paid for gas produced from legacy or old fields of national oil companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), and for newer fields lying in difficult-to-tap areas, such as deepsea.
Rates are fixed on April 1 and October 1 each year.
In April this year, the formula governing legacy fields was changed and indexed to 10 per cent of the prevailing Brent crude oil price. The rate was however capped at USD 6.5 per mmBtu.
Rates for legacy fields are now decided on a monthly basis. For September, the price came to USD 8.60 per mmBtu but because of the cap, the producers would get only USD 6.5.
Brent crude oil has averaged around USD 94 per barrel this month but rates will continue to be capped at USD 6.5.

Sources said the price for difficult area gas continues to be governed by the old formula that takes one-year average of international LNG prices and rates at some global gas hubs with a lag of one quarter.
International prices had fallen in the reference period of July 2022 to June 2023 and so it will translate into lower prices for difficult fields, they said.
The price for gas from difficult fields was cut to USD 12.12 per mmBtu for a month period, beginning April 1 from a record USD 12.46 earlier.
ADVERTISEMENT
The global spurt in energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to rates of locally-produced gas climbing to record levels – USD 8.57 per million British thermal unit for gas from legacy or old fields and USD 12.46 per mmBtu for gas from difficult fields between October 2022 and March 2023.
On April 1, prices of gas from legacy fields were slated to climb to USD 10.7 per mmBtu using the old formula. But the government changed the formula and put a cap to keep inflation under check.
Rates of CNG and piped gas for kitchens had risen by 70 per cent because of the previous gas price hike.
The ceiling price covers the cost of production of producers while protecting consumers, particularly CNG users, kitchens using piped cooking gas and fertiliser plants which had grappled with soaring input costs.
India is aiming to become a gas-based economy with the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix targeted to rise to 15 per cent by 2030 from the existing level of around 6.3 per cent.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/reliance-gas-price-reduced-14-pc-october-8947067/,business

These sectors have been identified after inter-ministerial consultations on the performance of the scheme for various products.
The official also said that disbursement of production-linked incentives (PLI) for white goods (AC and LED lights) would start this month and that would push the amount of disbursement, which was only Rs 2,900 crore till March 2023.

The scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors such as telecommunications, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.
“We have identified the sectors. We are going to send the combined note to seek approval of the Union Cabinet. The changes include extending some time (for pharma sector) and adding some additional products in some sectors.
“In textiles, we are expanding the definition of certain other products in the technical textiles segment; in drones, we are increasing the amount,” the government official, who did not wish to be named said.
The total amount allocated for the PLI scheme for drones and drone components is Rs 120 crore spread over three financial years.

A senior official of the commerce and industry ministry had earlier stated that some course corrections or tweaking were needed in PLI schemes that were not doing well.
PLI schemes for sectors which are not picking up well include high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries, textile products and speciality steel.
On the other hand, the scheme is doing well in sectors such as electronics, pharma, medical devices, telecom, food processing, and white goods.

The government is trying to sort out issues such as timely processing of claims, visa-related matters where vendors require Chinese professionals’ expertise, and delay in getting environmental clearances that have been raised by certain stakeholders of PLI schemes.
The purpose of the scheme is to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector; and make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.
These schemes for all 14 sectors have been notified by the concerned ministries/departments after due approval. These schemes are in various stages of implementation.

Google turned to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) after the General Court in 2021 threw out its challenge to the fine levied by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in 2017.
It was the first of three penalties for anti-competitive practices that have cost Google 8.25 billion euros in total in the last decade.
ADVERTISEMENT
Google lawyer Thomas Graf said the European Commission had failed to show that the company’s different treatment of rivals was abusive and that different treatment alone was not anti-competitive.
“Companies do not compete by treating competitors equally with themselves. They compete by treating them differently. The whole point of competition is for a company to differentiate itself from rivals. Not to align with rivals so that all are the same,” he told the panel of 15 judges.
“Qualifying every different treatment, and in particular different treatment of first party and third party businesses, as abusive would undermine competition. It would impair the ability and incentives of companies to compete and innovate,” Graf said.
Commission lawyer Fernando Castillo de la Torre dismissed Google’s arguments, saying the company had used its algorithms to unfairly favour its price comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust laws.

“Google was entitled to apply algorithms that lower the visibility of certain results which were less relevant for a user query,” he said.
“What Google was not entitled to do was to use its dominance in general search in order to extend its position over comparison shopping by promoting results of its own services, and embellishing them with attractive features and apply algorithms that are prone to pushing down the results of rivals and showing those results without attractive features,” he said.
The CJEU will rule in the coming months.
This case and two others involving the Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising service, however pale in comparison with the ongoing EU antitrust case into Google’s lucrative digital advertising business where regulators in June threaten to break up the company.

"UBS names South Korea, India, others as ‘slow’ on Credit Suisse approval","UBS has identified at least four countries, including South Korea and India, as being ""slow"" to grant the regulatory approvals needed to complete its takeover of Credit Suisse, an internal document reviewed by Reuters shows.","UBS has identified at least four countries, including South Korea and India, as being “slow” to grant the regulatory approvals needed to complete its takeover of Credit Suisse, an internal document reviewed by Reuters shows.
The Swiss banking giant has also highlighted Ireland and Saudi Arabia as “slow jurisdictions” in granting licences, according to the previously unreported document which was dated Sept. 6 and was circulated to UBS staff globally.
Prepared by UBS after a global review to assess the timeline of regulatory approvals necessary for the integration of Credit Suisse to complete, the document said uncooperative regulators could put transactions such as the Swiss bank deal at risk.
ADVERTISEMENT
The document says that “a single non-cooperative regulator can jeopardize the timeline of the parent bank merger and other transactions”, impacting other related integration deals.
The uncertainties could lead to winding down businesses and asset sales, when UBS faces “difficult jurisdictions or regulators”, the Swiss bank said in the document.
Credit Suisse, which was Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, suffered years of scandals and losses before it had to be rescued in March in a state-engineered takeover by UBS.
Although UBS completed the takeover in June, it still needs approvals from regulators in markets where both the banks operate for the legal completion of the first rescue of a global bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
ADVERTISEMENT
Credit Suisse declined to comment. UBS did not respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for central banks in South Korea, India, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia also did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
It is normal for large merger and acquisition deals to be delayed by the myriad regulatory approvals needed to close a deal, and in very few cases transactions do get derailed due to objections raised by some regulators.
The first-ever merger of two global systemically important banks has created both opportunities and risks for UBS, which has been working on integrating Credit Suisse’s businesses.
ADVERTISEMENT
Last month UBS said it expected the takeover to be completed in 2024. The bank’s internal document showed the process could be finished as soon as May next year.
‘CHANGE IN CONTROL’
In South Korea, it may take up to 18 to 22 months to obtain new licences, while in Ireland the process could take up to two years, and in Saudi Arabia up to 12 months, the document said.
The regulator in India could take a minimum of six months to approve the setting up of a new branch, it added.
UBS also said in the document that for Russia, a “change in control” approval may never be obtained as this could be a politically driven decision.
In a May disclosure filed with the U.S. securities regulator, UBS said that its exposure to Russia contributed $98 million to its total emerging market exposure of $18.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
Last month, a Moscow court banned UBS and Credit Suisse from disposing of shares in their Russian subsidiaries, Reuters reported, citing court documents.
Laws introduced after Russia despatched troops to Ukraine in February last year have made presidential approval necessary for banks to cut ties with their local business, while a government commission reviews all asset transfers involving Western firms.

After expanding 3.3% last year, global gross domestic product growth is on course to slow to 3.0% this year, the Organisation for Economic Development said in the latest update of its forecasts for major economies.
While that was an upgrade from 2.7% in the OECD’s June outlook, global growth was expected to slow to 2.7% in 2024 – down from its estimate of 2.9% in June.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Paris-based body said it now expected the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% this year rather than the 1.6% it forecast in June as U.S growth proves more resilient than most economists expected in the face of a series of rate hikes.
Nonetheless, it was likely to slow next year to 1.3%, though that was better than the 1.0% for 2024 expected in June.
The improved U.S. outlook for this year helped offset weakness in China and the euro zone, dragged down by Germany – the only major economy expected to be in recession.
The OECD forecast that the Chinese economy would slow from 5.1% this year to 4.6% next year as momentum from the end of COVID restrictions fades and the property market struggles. In June, the OECD had forecast 5.4% growth this year and 5.1% next year.

The OECD cut the euro zone’s growth outlook this year to just 0.6% from 0.9% in June, but forecast it would pick up next year to 1.1% – down from 1.5% in June – as Germany returned to growth.

"EU watchdog scrutinises banks’ defences after SVB, Credit Suisse woes","Recent banking crises in the United States, where Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and in Switzerland where UBS was forced to acquire Credit Suisse, show that banks and regulators need to increase preparedness for rapidly unfolding crises, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) said.","Most leading euro zone banks have met a January 2024 target for issuing special debt to replenish capital in a crisis, but some need to do more to ensure they can, if necessary, be wound up quickly, a European Union regulator said on Wednesday.
Recent banking crises in the United States, where Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and in Switzerland where UBS was forced to acquire Credit Suisse, show that banks and regulators need to increase preparedness for rapidly unfolding crises, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) said.
Forcing banks in the EU’s banking union to have minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) was a lesson from the 2008 global financial crisis where taxpayers had to bail out banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
MREL debt is written down in a crisis to “bail in” the bank and help stop it from being “too big to fail”.
The SRB, which sets MREL targets, said that by the end of 2022, two-thirds of banks met their final target.
The shortfall is 0.3% of total risk exposures or 20.5 billion euros ($21.87 billion). Some 2.7 trillion euros has been issued so far, and 24 banks have an MREL shortfall, though 14 of them have been given an extension until the end of 2024 or 2025 to meet their targets.
“While holding sufficient loss-absorbing resources at all times is key, it is equally important for banks to be able to use these funds in a crisis,” the SRB said in a report.
ADVERTISEMENT
Its focus is shifting to ensuring banks can credibly demonstrate by the end of this year that they can be smoothly “resolved” or wound down, restructured, or sold without disruption to customers.
“The SRB will review whether material shortcomings remain and take remedial action where needed,” it said, though there is no sign so far that it will need to intervene.
Evaporating liquidity was a hallmark of recent banking turmoil and is being scrutinised in resolution plans of banks.

“In order to foster consistency across banks’ scenarios to be considered while integrating lessons learnt from recent crisis cases, the SRB will develop further guidance on the assumptions to be used,” the watchdog said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/eu-watchdog-scrutinises-banks-defences-svb-credit-suisse-woes-8946283/,business

The Fed is due to wrap up a two day meeting on Wednesday. Japan’s central bank will meet Thursday-Friday as observers speculate that it might gradually begin to adjust its longstanding negative interest rate policy.
“Market sentiments remained in its usual wait-and-see ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG.
Monday on Wall Street, the S and P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent to 4,453.53 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 per cent to 34,624,30. The Nasdaq composite added less than 0.1 per cent to 13,710.24.

Stocks have been see-sawing since early August on uncertainty about whether the Fed will finally end its hikes to interest rates. Higher rates have helped cool inflation from its peak last summer, but they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments while slowing the economy.
Traders almost universally expect the Fed to keep rates steady at its meeting this week. Attention will mainly focus on forecasts Fed officials will publish about where they expect interest rates, the economy and the job market to head in upcoming years.
Traders are betting on a roughly 40 per cent chance the Fed will raise rates again in either November or December, according to data from CME Group.
ADVERTISEMENT
But just as much attention will be on what Fed officials say about next year, when investors expect the Fed to begin cutting interest rates. Investors crave such cuts, which typically loosen up financial conditions and give boosts to financial markets. The big question is by how much the Fed could cut.
Fears are strong that rates may have to stay higher for longer to get inflation down to the Fed’s 2 per cent target. That quest has been complicated by a recent spike in oil prices.
Worries about a possible recession persist though they have diminished as reports have shown the economy and job market remain resilient. One worrying factor is where bond yields are, with two-year and other shorter-term yields continuing to remain higher than longer-term yields. That’s an unusual occurrence that has often preceded recessions in the past.
Another warning signal comes from the leading economic indicators index, which looks at new orders for manufacturers, consumer expectations for business conditions and other factors that could show where the economy is heading.
When its six-month annualized rate-of-change contracts 3 per cent or more, it’s always been associated with a recession, according to Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group.

It’s been 15 months since the most recent such warning. In the past, the longest stretch between such a trigger and a recession was the 16 months before the Great Recession. If this matches that one, it could imply a recession beginning in October, Ramsey says.

U.S. oil output from top shale-producing regions is on track to fall to 9.393 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, the lowest level since May 2023, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday. It will have fallen for three months in a row.
Those estimates come after Saudi Arabia and Russia this month extended a combined 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply cuts to the end of the year.
“Oil’s ascent into overbought territory leaves the market vulnerable to a correction,” analysts from National Australia Bank wrote in a client note, pointing to volatility after speeches from Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister on Monday.

India’s FY24 growth to be above 6% on back of macroeconomic stability: RBI MPC member Ashima Goyal,"RBI MPC member Ashima Goyal said that a global slowdown reducing India's export growth, geopolitics fueling oil and food prices, and erratic weather are some of the continuing risks that the country faces.","India’s economic growth will be above 6 per cent in the current fiscal as the country has managed to strengthen its macroeconomic stability and performance even in a period of large global shocks, RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Member Ashima Goyal said on Monday.
Goyal further said that a global slowdown reducing India’s export growth, geopolitics fueling oil and food prices, and erratic weather are some of the continuing risks that the country faces. “India has managed to strengthen its macroeconomic stability and performance even in a period of large global shocks. India’s GDP growth in FY24 will be above 6 per cent,” she told PTI in a telephonic interview.
While GDP growth in 2022-23 was 7.2 per cent, lower than 9.1 per cent in 2021-22, the RBI projects India’s GDP to grow at 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal year.

Asked when retail inflation will decline to RBI’s target of 4 per cent, the eminent economist said inflation expectations are getting anchored at around 4 per cent.
“For a long time now, firms’ inflation expectations are around 4 per cent. That means, despite cost shocks, their price increases do not exceed 4 per cent,” Goyal noted.
Observing that core inflation is softening, she said inflation targeting is teaching price-setters to look through transient supply shocks.
According to Goyal, under transient even if repeated supply shocks (like the Ukraine war), monetary tightening should be adequate to anchor inflation expectations, but not so sharp as to impose a large growth sacrifice on the economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
“But other supply-side policies will continue to reduce inflation,” she opined.
Retail inflation declined to 6.83 per cent in August after touching a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July, mainly due to softening prices of vegetables, but still remains above the Reserve Bank’s comfort zone.
RBI has the mandate to keep retail inflation in the range of 2 to 6 per cent.

Commenting on a recent brokerage report which stated private capex actually declined in the last two quarters, Goyal asserted that it is absurd to over-interpret quarterly changes.
While observing that since the pandemic annual gross domestic capital formation has been rising, she said it has fluctuated in quarters. “quarter on quarter growth is normally negative in Q1 and shows the highest growth in Q4,” Goyal said, adding that many other types of data, including bank credit, IPOs and capital goods imports, show a revival in private capex.
Pointing out that the government capex creates opportunities for private capex in steel, cement, logistics, green infrastructure , she noted that people mistakenly think it is not happening because they expect a 2008 type boom.
“Private capex will rise sustainably in step with GDP in a virtuous cycle, even if there are some delays because of political uncertainty in an election year,’ she said, adding that policy continuity is very important for private capex.
Responding to a question on rising crude oil prices and it’s impact on the government’s subsidy figures and inflation, Goyal said the government and oil companies have built-up counter-cyclical buffers by not fully passing through a fall in international crude oil prices.
ADVERTISEMENT
Emphasising that in a well- established inflation targeting regime, transient rise in cost is looked through and does not have second round effects, she noted that high crude oil prices have intensified efforts to diversify away from oil.
“So overall we are seeing less pass-through of higher oil prices to Indian inflation,” she said.

With international crude oil prices breaching USD 90 per barrel mark for the first time in 10 months, Indian refiners which are the key beneficiaries of cheaper Russian crude should still be able to clock refining margins of around USD 9-10 per barrel in current fiscal, CareEdge Ratings had said recently.
Asked if India losing out on accurate data measurement as the government is yet to come up with the latest version of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and Census, she said overhauling statistical systems takes time.

“The pandemic, as well as excessive criticism, has intensified the break in many of these periodic surveys…The break is a loss to policy-making,” Goyal said.
The eminent economist, however, noted that now India has all kinds of new high-frequency data to aid policy.
In 2021, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) decided not to release the Consumer Expenditure Survey results of 2017-18 due to data quality issues. According to the ministry, the reference period for the next Household Consumer Expenditure Survey is 2022-2023.
The decadal Census, postponed for an indefinite period due to the pandemic, is unlikely to be held before the next Lok Sabha elections that are due in April-May 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-fy24-growth-above-6-pc-macroeconomic-stability-rbi-mpc-member-ashima-goyal-8945410/,business

With this, the year-to-date inflow in the category has reached more than Rs 1,400 crore, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed.
Apart from inflow, the asset base of Gold ETFs and investors’ account or folio numbers increased in the period under review.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to data, gold-linked ETFs have seen an inflow of Rs 1,028 crore in August. This came following an inflow of Rs 456 crore in the segment in July.
Before that, Gold ETF saw inflow to the tune of Rs 298 crore during the April-June period after three quarters of consecutive outflow. The category saw a withdrawal of Rs 1,243 crore in the March quarter, Rs 320 crore in the December quarter, and Rs 165 crore in the September quarter.
The month of August witnessed the highest monthly inflow into Gold ETFs since April 2022 when the category attracted Rs 1,100 crore on the back of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Flows into Gold ETFs have been subdued since then as the US Federal Reserve embarked on its tightening cycle.

“As the end to the Fed’s tightening cycle is now coming close, prospects for gold are looking good. The metal has held its ground despite US yields and the US dollar being on an upward trajectory lately. A potential US recession, central bank gold buying, geopolitical tensions, rising US debt levels are all supporting interest in the precious metal,” Ghazal Jain, Fund Manager – Alternative Investments at Quantum Mutual Fund, said.
Moreover, gold prices in recent times have come off from its all-time high levels, thereby providing some buying opportunity, particularly after a sharp rally it witnessed since March this year, Melvyn Santarita, Analyst – Manager Research at Morningstar India, said.
“With the continued hike in interest rates in the US, inflation still higher than expectations, and growth rate slowing down, the appeal of gold as a safe haven and hedge against inflation is expected to continue,” Santarita added.

Gold, with its superlative performance over the last few years, has attracted significant investor interest and the consistent surge in its folio numbers is a testimony of the same.
Investor accounts in Gold ETFs climbed by 20,500 folios to 47.95 lakh in August from 47.75 lakh in the preceding month. This shows that investors have become more inclined toward gold-related funds.
Further, the assets under management of Gold ETFs surged by over 4 per cent to Rs 24,318 crore in August from Rs 23,330 crore in the preceding month.
Gold ETFs, which track the domestic physical gold price, are passive investment instruments that are based on gold prices and invest in gold bullion. In short, Gold ETFs are units representing physical gold which may be in paper or dematerialised form.
One Gold ETF unit is equal to 1 gram of gold and is backed by physical gold of very high purity.

"Trade deficit climbs to 10-month high in August, exports down 6.86%","Exports sectors, which recorded negative growth in August, include tea, coffee, rice, spices, leather, gems and jewellery, textiles, and petroleum products. 15 of the 30 key sectors recorded positive growth in August.","Merchandise exports declined for the seventh consecutive month in August to $34.48 billion, a fall of 6.86 per cent from the year-ago period mainly due to subdued global demand for petroleum and gems and jewellery sectors.
Data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Friday showed that imports also declined for the ninth month in the row by 5.23 per cent to $58.64 billion, which means that the trade deficit, the gap between exports and imports, stood at $24.16 billion in August, a ten-month high.
Excluding gems and jewellery and petroleum, exports in August were $26 billion compared to $25.02 billion last year. Cumulatively, exports during April-August contracted by 11.9 per cent to $172.95 billion. Imports during the five-month period fell by 12 per cent to $271.83 billion. The trade deficit narrowed to $98.88 billion against $112.85 billion during April-August 2022.

Finance Ministry dismisses criticism about ‘inflated’ GDP,"In other words, growth as per the Income Approach was lower. Using the expenditure approach, it would have been higher than the 7.2% reported for FY23 and higher than the 9.1% reported for FY22,” the ministry said in a series of tweets on Friday.","Responding to critics questioning the discrepancies in the 7.8 per cent GDP growth rate seen during April-June, the Finance Ministry on Friday said citing nominal GDP growth being lower than real GDP growth is a “new bogey being spread to discredit the GDP numbers and indicate that underlying economic activity is quite weak” and “both do not stand up to scrutiny”.
“India’s real GDP growth was 7.8% y/y (year on year) in Q1 FY24 (first Quarter of FY 2023-24). This is as per the Income or Production Approach. As per the expenditure approach, it would have been lower.

Mercedes-Benz India to extend its EV charging network to customers of other brands,Mercedes-Benz India announced the extension of its electric vehicle charging network to the customers of other brands as it looks to accelerate faster adoption of electric vehicles in the country.,"German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz India on Friday announced the extension of its electric vehicle charging network to the customers of other brands as it looks to accelerate faster adoption of electric vehicles in the country.
The carmaker also launched the top-end EQE 500 4MATIC electric SUV at an introductory price of Rs 1.39 crore (all India ex-showroom) and a new ‘Customer Experience Centre’ at Chakan, in Pune.
Mercedes-Benz is also supporting the EV (Electric Vehicle) transition in India by democratising the ultra-fast charging network. All EV customers in India across brands, can now enjoy the luxurious Mercedes-Benz experience while using the company’s charging network, Santosh Iyer, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Mercedes-Benz India (MBI), said.

The company said it has the largest charging network within the luxury car space with 140 chargers at different points. Of these, 40 chargers are in the 180 kilowatts and the 60 kilowatt area, which means fast chargers, said.
“…we will be extending this entire charging facility, not only for Mercedes customers but for all brands, luxury and mass, so that they can come in and charge their cars at a faster pace at our fast charging network,” Iyer said.
The move will help in further accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in India, he added.
Moreover, MBI has also developed an app along with Bengaluru-based Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI), which enables EV customers to get access to an additional 150 superchargers, Iyer said.

The app can be downloaded by any customer — of Mercedes or non-Mercedes — and it gives access to a fast charging network across India and can help in day-to-day commute or their interested commute, Iyer added.
On the launch, he said, “We are strengthening our BEV portfolio by launching the EQE 500 4MATIC SUV. This is an important addition to our BEV portfolio offering segment-leading luxury appointments, technology and connectivity, among others.” The EQE 500 4MATIC SUV comes with a segment-best, 10-year battery warranty, and a service interval of once in two years, the company said.

US auto workers target Detroit Three with first simultaneous strike,"The strikes involving a combined 12,700 workers will take place at assembly plants operated by Ford in Wayne, Michigan, GM in Wentzville, Missouri and Stellantis' Jeep brand in Toledo, Ohio.","The United Auto Workers union launched simultaneous strikes at three factories owned by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler owner Stellantis on Friday, kicking off the most ambitious US industrial labor action in decades.
The walkouts at the Detroit Three will halt production of the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck, along with other popular models.

“For the first time in our history we will strike all three of the Big Three,” UAW President Shawn Fain said, adding that the union will hold off more costly company-wide strikes for now, but all options are open if new contracts are not agreed. Fain laid out plans for the walkouts on Facebook Live, less than two hours before the expiration of the old contract.

The walkouts cap weeks of clashes between Fain and Detroit Three executives over union demands for a bigger share of profits generated by combustion trucks, and stronger job security as automakers shift to electric vehicles. The standoff has become a political issue, with President Joe Biden, facing re-election next year, calling for a deal.
The strikes involving a combined 12,700 workers will take place at assembly plants operated by Ford in Wayne, Michigan, GM in Wentzville, Missouri and Stellantis’ Jeep brand in Toledo, Ohio. They are critical to the production of some of the automakers’ most profitable vehicles. Fain’s decision to go with targeted walkouts could limit the cost to the union of strike pay. The UAW has a $825 million strike fund, which pales in comparison to billions in liquidity the automakers have built up thanks to robust profits from the trucks and SUVs UAW members build. Stellantis has more than 90 days worth of Jeeps in stock, and has been building SUVs and trucks on overtime, according to Cox Automotive data.

But a week-long shutdown at its Jeep plant in Toledo could cut revenue by more than $380 million, based on data from Stellantis’ financial reports.
“This is more of a symbolic strike than an actual damaging one,” said Sam Fiorani, a production forecaster at Auto Forecast Solutions, who added that he had expected more in the first wave of the strike. “If the negotiations don’t go in a direction that Fain thinks is positive, we can fully expect a larger strike coming in a week or two,” he said. Fiorani estimated the limited action would stop production of about 24,000 vehicles a week. And while it targets some key brands, buyers would be willing to wait, for now.

In Wayne, Michigan, hundreds of people, including auto workers on the night shift and their supporters, gathered at a Ford assembly plant as the strike began.
Stellantis shares fell more than 1% in early trading, among the worst performers on the euro-zone STOXX50 index. Ford shares were down 2.3% and GM was off 1.7% in early premarket trading in New York in thin volumes.
Companies fear cost hikes
The union has said it wants a 40% raise. The companies have offered up to 20%, but without key benefits demanded by the union. None of the Detroit Three has proposed eliminating tiered wage systems that require new hires to stay on the job for eight years to earn the same as veteran workers – a key UAW demand.

Ford said the UAW’s latest proposals would double its U.S. labor costs and make it uncompetitive against Tesla and other non-union rivals. A walkout could mean that UAW profit-sharing checks for this year would be “decimated,” it said.
Stellantis said it had immediately gone into “contingency mode” and would take all appropriate structural decisions to protect the company and its North American operations, without elaborating.
Fain said earlier this week that Stellantis had proposed shutting as many as 18 U.S. facilities.
GM said it was disappointed by the walkout, and would continue to “bargain in good faith.”

Ahead of Fain’s address, GM’s top manufacturing executive Gerald Johnson said in a video that the UAW’s wage and benefits proposals would cost the automaker $100 billion, “more than twice the value of all of General Motors and absolutely impossible to absorb.” He did not detail how the union proposals would result in that cost, or over what time frame. Fain has rejected the automakers’ assertions that union demands would cost too much, saying the companies have spent billions on share buybacks and executive salaries.

Biden is pouring billions in federal subsidies into expanding sales of electric vehicles. But the shift to EVs could threaten UAW combustion powertrain jobs. The union has not endorsed Biden’s re-election. “I think the Biden administration just continues to watch this slow-moving car crash as its EV strategy collides head on with unions,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.
ADVERTISEMENT
UAW President Fain has taken an unorthodox approach to the negotiations, bargaining with all three Detroit automakers simultaneously. Past UAW leaders chose one company to set a contract pattern for the other two. Fain has played the companies against each other, seeking to drive up their offers. While a deal with one or more of the automakers could come at any time, the disruption is an opportunity for non-union automakers in the United States, including Tesla, Toyota , Honda and Mercedes.
Those non-union factories, plus imported vehicles, account for more than half of the vehicles sold in the U.S. market.
A full strike would hit earnings by about $400 million to $500 million at each affected automaker per week of lost production, Deutsche Bank estimates. Some of those losses could be recouped by later boosting production schedules, but that possibility fades as a strike extends to weeks or months.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/world-market/u-s-auto-workers-target-detroit-three-with-first-simultaneous-strike-8941339/,business

The French oil company could invest about $700 million in the projects in a drive to expand its clean energy portfolio, the report said on Friday, citing one source.
TotalEnergies and Adani did not immediately reply to Reuters’ requests for comment.

Hindenburg Research had in January alleged improper dealings and use of tax havens by Adani Group, resulting in shares of its companies losing about $150 billion in value.
The group’s shares have since recovered some of their losses, after a Supreme Court-appointed panel found “no regulatory failure” on price manipulation in Adani Group stocks.
Adani Green shares were up 2.4% on Friday.

"China economic data show signs slowdown may be easing, as central bank acts to support growth","China's factories picked up their pace and retail sales also gained momentum in August, the government reported Friday, suggesting the economy may be gradually recovering from its post-pandemic malaise.","China’s factories picked up their pace and retail sales also gained momentum in August, the government reported Friday, suggesting the economy may be gradually recovering from its post-pandemic malaise.
However, despite busy activity in restaurants and stores, the figures showed continuing weakness in the all-important property sector, where real estate developers are struggling to repay heavy loads of debt in a time of slack demand. Investment in real estate fell 8.8% in August from the year before. The decline has been worsening since the beginning of the year.
Acting to relieve the burden on banks, the People’s Bank of China, or central bank, announced late Thursday that the reserve requirement for most lenders would be cut by 0.25 percentage points as of Friday.
ADVERTISEMENT
That would free up more money for lending, “In order to consolidate the foundation for economic recovery and maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity,” the central bank said.
Friday’s report showed retail sales rose 4.6% in August from a year earlier, with auto sales climbing 5.1%. Retail sales rose a meager 2.5% in July.
Industrial output grew at a 4.5% annual pace, up from 3.7% in July and the fastest rate since April.
“Overall, in August, major indicators improved marginally, the national economy recovered, high-quality development was solidly advanced, and positive factors accumulated,” the State Council Information Office said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
But it added that there were “still many external factors of instability and uncertainty” and that domestic demand remains weak, so that “the foundation for economic recovery still needs to be consolidated.” The trends in August were somewhat better than expected, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.
“Fiscal support shored up investment but the real bright spot was a healthy pick-up in consumer spending, suggesting that households may be turning slightly less cautious,” he said.
China’s economy expanded by 0.8% in the three months ending in June compared with the previous quarter, down from 2.2% in January-March. That is equivalent to a 3.2% annual rate, which would be among the weakest pace in decades.

Roughly one in five young workers is unemployed, a record high, adding to pressures on consumer spending.

Setting up of state-level benches of GSTAT would help businesses by way of faster dispute resolution.
Currently, taxpayers aggrieved with ruling of tax authorities are required to move the respective High Courts. The resolution process takes a long time as High Courts are already burdened with backlog of cases and do not have a specialised bench to deal with GST cases.

Tata Motors plans to set up separate sales network for EVs this fiscal year,"Tata Motors plans to set up separate sales network for its electric passenger vehicles in current fiscal year as it looks to give differentiated experience to the buyers opting for the environment-friendly models, according to a top company official.","Tata Motors plans to set up separate sales network for its electric passenger vehicles in current fiscal year as it looks to give differentiated experience to the buyers opting for the environment-friendly models, according to a top company official.
The Mumbai-based auto major, which on Thursday introduced all-new versions of its Nexon EV and Nexon (internal combustion engine), said it will start experimenting with new outlets in some of the cities where EV volumes have gone up.
“We’ll have to separate them (sales outlets for EVs and ICE) given that we have different requirements of customers and also a growing portfolio (of EVs)” Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Managing Director Shailesh Chandra told PTI in an interaction.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the company would look at places where it would be viable to have exclusive outlets for the EV range.
“We need to separate outlets because there would not be enough space to keep both EVs, ICE models at the same place..So there’s a practical difficulty… we will not be able to do justice to both. So you will start seeing exclusive outlets starting slowly from the coming quarters,” Chandra stated.
Tata Motors’ current EV portfolio comprises the flagship SUV Nexon EV range, Tiago EV, Tigor EV and the XPRES-T EV.
When asked about the locations where the exclusive outlets would come up, Chandra said: “We’ll start with pilot cities. I can’t disclose the locations right now. But as I said that within this financial year, we’ll start with some experiment.” The company recently introduced the new retail identity for its unit Tata Passenger Electric Mobility. Tata Motors utilises the shop-in-shop concept in its existing dealerships to retail EV models.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chandra said the demand for EVs is witnessing an upward trend and for Tata Motors, the EV range accounts for 13-15 per cent of the company’s overall sales.
“Revenue wise it will be 18-20 per cent as of quarter one. Next three to four years I would imagine this to go up to 25 per cent,” he added.
Tata Motors expects electric vehicles to account for half of its passenger vehicle sales by 2030, Chandra said. The new Nexon.ev is priced between Rs 14.74-19.94 lakh (ex-showroom). It comes with a maximum range of 465 km in a single charge.
ADVERTISEMENT
The model can charge another compatible EV and can also power external gadgets, appliances such as electrical camping equipment, power tools and a variety of consumer electronics devices.
Chandra stated that EV customers constitute a unique community that is fast growing and distinguished by their evolved choices and hunger for next-gen technology.
“The Nexon.ev aptly fulfils their evolving, astute preferences with a technologically advanced, on-the-move solution that seamlessly blends with their contemporary way of life,” he added.
The company also introduced the Nexon with petrol and diesel engines with introductory prices starting from Rs 8.09 lakh (ex-showroom). Chandra said the compact SUV segment, in which Nexon competes with the likes of Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, has grown very steeply over the years.
“When we had launched Nexon in 2017, this segment used to see sales of 30,000 units a month, today it has grown to 90,000 units a month,” he noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
This is the most intensely fought segment as well with all the leading players having a product in the market, Chandra said.
Tata Motors has sold 5.5 lakh units of Nexon so far in the country.

“We are confident that this new avatar of the Nexon will appeal to a wider audience of customers, cement its position as India’s best selling SUV and further enrich its legacy,” Chandra stated.

Dubai Aerospace flags corrosion in plane leased to bankrupt Go First,"Foreign lessors have been engaged in a legal tussle to repossess their aircraft after the Indian airline was granted bankruptcy protection in May, imposing an asset freeze that blocked the recovery of 50 plus grounded Airbus planes.","Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) Capital has told an Indian court it detected corrosion of some parts and “a greenish deposit” on a plane leased to bankrupt airline Go First, after another lessor complained about “robbed” parts.
Foreign lessors have been engaged in a legal tussle to repossess their aircraft after the Indian airline was granted bankruptcy protection in May, imposing an asset freeze that blocked the recovery of 50 plus grounded Airbus planes.
The lessors currently are only allowed an occasional inspection of the grounded Go First planes, which DAE and others claim are not being properly maintained.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a Sept. 6 filing seeking to ensure the airline carries out maintenance, DAE submitted pictures to the Delhi High Court showing corroding plane parts and said the aircraft will “continue to deteriorate, resulting in a sharp decline in the value of the asset.”
Go First did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month, lessor ACG Aircraft Leasing, asked a court to direct the airline to replace “robbed” parts from its leased jets and allow it to appoint around the clock security to guard grounded aircraft, after it found many parts were missing.
DAE court documents show it was worried about a lack of covers on cabin and cockpit seats “which would eventually lead to fungus formation”, according to an internal e-mail contained in the filing.

The filing also stated DAE found a “greenish deposit” on the plane’s body. Indian media outlet Mint reported on Thursday that another lessor, BOC Aviation, also told the Delhi court about algae formation as the planes were not covered.
Go First lessor SMBC Aviation Capital Aviation in May told an Indian court that Indian bankruptcy law, which blocks plane repossession, will jolt the market and spark a confidence crisis.

Adani Group forms JV for marketing of green hydrogen in Japan,"Adani Group on Thursday said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Japanese conglomerate Kowa Group for sale of green hydrogen in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii markets.","Adani Group on Thursday said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Japanese conglomerate Kowa Group for sale of green hydrogen in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii markets.
Billionaire Gautam Adani-led conglomerate is investing up to USD 50 billion over the next 10 years in setting up a fully integrated green hydrogen ecosystem in India. This includes the production of 1 million tonne of green hydrogen in the initial phase which will be ramped up to 3 million tonne later.
“Adani Global Pte Ltd, Singapore, a step-down wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, announced a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Kowa Holdings Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore for sales and marketing of green ammonia, green hydrogen and its derivatives. The JV will concentrate on marketing of products in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii,” the group said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hydrogen is a clean energy source. It is mainly used in the refining and chemical sectors and produced using fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable sources such as solar, to power an electrolyzer that splits the hydrogen from water molecules.
Adani already is the largest renewable energy producer and for the green hydrogen project, it plans to expand its solar module manufacturing capabilities at Mundra SEZ in Gujarat to up to 10 GW per annum. The Mundra factory would manufacture metallurgical grade (mg) silicon, polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and the module itself that are used to generate electricity from solar energy.
Sea water will be desalinated before using its electrolyzers to produce low-cost green hydrogen.
“The JV with Kowa for green hydrogen marketing is a natural and strategic extension of Adani Group’s long-standing marketing and trading relationship with Kowa,” the statement said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), the green hydrogen platform of Adani Group, is developing end-to-end solutions to produce globally competitive green hydrogen and its associated sustainable derivatives at scale.
“The first project of ANIL of 1 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) green hydrogen is being implemented in phases in Gujarat. The initial phase is expected to start production by FY2027. Depending on market conditions, ANIL aims to increase capacity to up to 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen in the next 10 years, with an investment of about USD 50 billion,” it said.
After hydrogen is produced, it can either be transported directly (which is a risky and costly affair) or converted to ammonia, often referred to as ‘green ammonia’.
ADVERTISEMENT
Clean hydrogen can help decarbonise a range of sectors, including long-haul transport, chemicals, and iron and steel, where it has proven difficult to reduce emissions. Hydrogen-powered vehicles would improve air quality and promote energy security as it produces just water on being burnt in an engine.
ANIL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL).
“ANIL’s strategy is focused on development of an integrated hydrogen ecosystem with three business streams – manufacturing of supply chain products (i.e. solar- polysilicon, ingot, wafer, cell & module, wind turbine generator, electrolyzers and ancillary items), green hydrogen generation, and production of downstream derivative products (i.e. green ammonia, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel and others),” the statement said.
The combined strength of Adani Group’s experience in renewable equipment manufacturing, setting up large scale generation projects, building grid infrastructure, and proven project execution capabilities gives it a significant competitive advantage while building the green hydrogen ecosystem in India, it said.
“ANIL is well positioned to realise its targets and provide green molecules and sustainable fuels at globally competitive cost. Mundra ports’ proximity to global supply chain enables export opportunity of green hydrogen and derivatives, especially considering availability of jetty for shipment of cryogenic products,” it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-group-japan-joint-venture-green-hydrogen-marketing-8939590/,business

China asks big banks to stagger and adjust dollar purchases: Report,"Chinese banks have been asked not to square their positions in the inter-bank foreign exchange markets after any US dollar sales to clients, until their spot foreign exchange position hits a certain level, reported Reuters.","China’s central bank has asked some of the country’s biggest lenders to refrain from immediately squaring their foreign exchange positions in the market, and to run open positions for a while in order to alleviate downside pressure on the yuan, two sources with knowledge the matter said.
As part of this informal “window guidance”, banks have been asked not to square their positions in the inter-bank foreign exchange markets after any U.S. dollar sales to clients, until their spot foreign exchange position hits a certain level, the sources said.
Most banks are allowed to run a net short or long foreign currency position in spot dollar-yuan markets, within defined limits.

India slashes solar imports from China as domestic manufacturing thrives,"Year-on-year, India's solar module imports from China plummeted from 9.8 GW in the first half of 2022 to a mere 2.3 GW during the corresponding period in 2023, the report by global energy think tank Ember said.","In a departure from global trends, India has recorded a substantial 76 per cent drop in solar module imports from China during the first half of 2023 which reflects New Delhi’s resolute shift towards self-sufficiency in solar manufacturing, a new report said on Thursday.
Year-on-year, India’s solar module imports from China plummeted from 9.8 GW in the first half of 2022 to a mere 2.3 GW during the corresponding period in 2023, the report by global energy think tank Ember said.
This strategic shift, coupled with the imposition of tariffs, underscores India’s determination to minimise dependency on imports and prioritise the development of its domestic manufacturing capacity.
ADVERTISEMENT
Neshwin Rodrigues, an India Electricity Policy Analyst at Ember, said, “India’s dependence on China for solar module imports is well and truly reducing post-2022. Domestic manufacturing is gaining momentum, thanks to recent policy interventions.” “As India edges closer to self-sufficiency in solar manufacturing, reliance on Chinese modules and cells is no longer a constraint. What’s crucial now is creating an enabling policy environment to ensure that solar installations keep pace with the National Electricity Plan,” he said.
India started levying a customs duty of 40 per cent on solar modules and 25 per cent on solar cells from April 2022 in a bid to cut imports and boost local manufacturing.
The country’s commitment to reducing import dependency and nurturing a robust domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem aligns with the nation’s broader goals of sustainability and energy self-reliance.
According to its updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are national plans to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, India has committed to achieving 500 GW of installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. Solar is at the heart of this ambitious goal.
ADVERTISEMENT
The report also said China’s exports of solar panels rose by an impressive 3 per cent in the first half of 2023, reaching a total of 114 GW shipped worldwide.
This marks a substantial increase from the 85 GW exported during the same period in the previous year.
Ember’s data lead, Sam Hawkins, said, “Solar growth is going through the roof.” China’s dominance in the solar panel manufacturing market, accounting for about 80 per cent of the global market share, has significant global implications.
ADVERTISEMENT
More than half of the solar modules exported from China during the first half of 2023 were destined for Europe, making up 52.5 per cent of exports.
Europe experienced the most substantial absolute growth worldwide, with exports from China increasing by 47 per cent year-on-year (21 GW), reaching a total of 65 GW during the first half of 2023 compared to 44 GW in the same period the previous year.
While Europe led in absolute growth, the fastest expansion occurred in Africa and the Middle East.
South Africa witnessed a remarkable increase of 438 per cent (2.7 GW) in solar panel imports from China in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year.
This surge contributed to Africa’s overall growth of 187 per cent (3.7 GW), making it the fastest-growing region.
ADVERTISEMENT
Following Africa, the Middle East experienced a 64 per cent growth (2.4 GW) during the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year.
The report noted that despite the surge in solar panel exports, the gap between solar module exports and installed PV capacity is widening globally. This is attributed to stockpiling of modules in warehouses and challenges related to the installation and grid integration of solar generation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sam Hawkins, data lead at Ember, emphasised the need to accelerate installation and grid integration to keep pace with the global module supply, saying, “We have enough solar panels; we just need to get busy installing them.” He called for policies that prioritise the rapid scaling of installation and grid integration to match the increasing module supply.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-slashes-solar-imports-china-domestic-manufacturing-thrives-8939337/,business

Reliance sold a 10.09% stake in its retail unit in 2020, valuing it at 4.68 trillion rupees ($56.4 billion). At that time, GIC and ADIA invested $664 million each, while PIF pumped in $1.15 billion, based on current exchange rates.
A fourth source briefed on the dealmaking said the 2020 fund raising agreements had a clause that allowed existing investors to increase their stakes, and those investment funds were showing keen interest.

Ambani’s Indian retail empire has more than 18,000 stores, with operations ranging from groceries to electronics. It includes foreign partnerships with brands such as Marks and Spencer and competes with Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart in one of the world’s biggest markets.
When ADIA invested in Reliance Retail in 2020, it said it was part of its strategy of targeting market leading businesses in Asia linked to the region’s consumption-driven growth.
Last month Ambani said in a speech that “several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest” in his company, but gave no names. In 2019, the billionaire said his group planned to list the retail business in five years.
Reliance Retail reported a consolidated net profit of 91.81 billion rupees ($1.11 billion) for the financial year that ended in March 2023, on revenue of 2.6 trillion rupees. It has also forayed into the consumer goods business, which will compete with likes of Coca-Cola and Unilever.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/reliance-retail-new-investments-1-5-billion-gulf-singapore-funds-report-8938422/,business
"Cabinet approves Rs 1,650 crore to add 75 lakh new Ujjwala scheme connections over 3 years","The price cut and expansion of PMUY, which came ahead of Assembly elections in five states later this year and the Lok Sabha elections next year, was described by the government as its gift to the people on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Onam.","The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) in order to add 75 lakh poor households to the scheme’s beneficiary base over three years at an estimated cost of Rs 1,650 crore. The nod to PMUY expansion and the scheme of release of grant to public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) for the same follows the government’s August 29 announcement of slashing cooking gas prices for all domestic consumers by Rs 200 per cylinder and expanding the beneficiary base of PMUY to 10.35 crore from 9.60 crore at present.
The price cut and expansion of PMUY, which came ahead of Assembly elections in five states later this year and the Lok Sabha elections next year, was described by the government as its gift to the people on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Onam.
The Rs 1,650 crore estimate only for the cost of connection to the new 75 lakh beneficiaries of PMUY over 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26, and does not include the targeted subsidy of Rs 200 per 14.2-kg cooking gas cylinder for up to 12 refills per year. Under PMUY, cooking gas connections are issued to women members of poor households, and the connection, stove, and the first cylinder are given free of charge. The per-cylinder subsidy of Rs 200, which beneficiaries get as a bank transfer from the OMCs, is also borne by the government as the OMCs are reimbursed for it.

“Some eligible households still do not have LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) connection. This is due to multiple reasons–new households are formed every year as a result of rising population, marriages, migration, nuclearlisation of families, left over households, extremely remote locations, etc… PMUY has been widely praised as a successful social welfare scheme which has majorly contributed to the increase in LPG penetration in the country from 62% in 2016 to near saturation now,” the government said in a release on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
As per government data, the average LPG refill rate for PMUY beneficiaries was 3.71 cylinders for financial year 2022-23 in terms of 14.2-kg cylinders. Going by the current beneficiary base of 9.6 crore, the total number of 14.2-kg cylinders consumed by PMUY consumers comes out to be 35.6 crore per year, resulting in a subsidy outgo of over Rs 7,100 crore per year, calculations show. For the targeted 10.35 crore beneficiary base, the annualised cooking gas subsidy bill, assuming the PMUY refill rate stays at 3.71 cylinders per year and subsidy remains constant Rs 200 per cylinder, would be around Rs 7,700 crore.
The government had stopped providing cooking gas subsidy in the early months of the 2020-21 fiscal, when global oil and fuel prices had crashed. Later, the subsidy was brought back, but only for poor households covered under the scheme.
While the government will bear the cost of expanding the PMUY beneficiary base and the consequent increase in subsidy outgo, it is unlikely to foot the expense for the price cut and the OMCs are expected to absorb the hit, at least for the time being, according to people in the know.
As per The Indian Express’s analysis of current cooking gas refill rates and the total domestic consumer base, the Rs 200-per-cylinder price cut alone could cost over Rs 36,000 crore on an annualised basis, assuming refill rates remain constant and fuel retailers continue to sell LPG to households at a price that is Rs 200 lower than what they would have charged for a cylinder had the price cut not been announced.
ADVERTISEMENT
The actual cost could be different from this estimate as there are a number of variables in the equation. These include possible over recoveries on LPG sales by fuel retailers, movement in international crude and LPG prices going ahead, and currency fluctuations. On its part, the government has not provided any estimate of the cost of the price cut.
Even as the government was not giving any subsidy to non-PMUY consumers, it did provide a one-time grant of Rs 22,000 crore to the three OMCs last year to compensate them for selling LPG at a loss for the previous two years, which had resulted in accumulated losses of Rs 28,000 crore. The grant came at a time when the OMCs were grappling with significant losses, particularly in the fuel retail segment. However, the companies have now largely recovered from last year’s losses and industry insiders do not expect the government to be as eager to help the companies through a special financial grant.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/75-lakh-lpg-connections-three-years-pradha-mantri-ujjwala-yojana-8938297/,business

"Byju’s hid $533 mn in obscure hedge fund, say lenders; firm says not proscribed to move funds","Byju's US-based subsidiary Alpha Inc transferred more than half a billion dollars to Camshaft Capital Fund in 2022, Bloomberg reported, citing a lawsuit in US court.","Lenders have alleged that Byju’s hid USD 533 million in an obscure three-year-old hedge fund to avoid it being seized to make up for a loan default, but the ed-tech titan claimed its agreement with lenders did not explicitly proscribe movement of funds.
Byju’s US-based subsidiary Alpha Inc transferred more than half a billion dollars to Camshaft Capital Fund in 2022, Bloomberg reported, citing a lawsuit in US court.
The investment firm, founded by William C Morton when he was just 23 years old, received the funds despite an apparent lack of formal training in investment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since the transfer, luxury cars – a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracan EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith – have been registered in Morton’s name, according to a lender petition in the court.
Lenders claim the cash was collateral for a USD 1.2 billion loan and now want control over it as there has been a default in payments.
Byju’s, however, said the transaction was fully within the bounds of its credit agreement with lenders, which explicitly does not proscribe or limit the movement or investment of funds disbursed under its terms.
“As a commercially prudent borrower and like any other large corporate treasury, Byju’s Alpha has made investments in a multi-hundred billion dollar fund with high security fixed income instruments. Our Credit Agreement with the lenders does not prohibit or restrict the movement or investment of monies disbursed thereunder. There is no requirement for Byju’s to maintain cash as collateral,” a company spokesperson said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lenders in Miami-Dade County court filings contended that Byju’s made significant efforts to obscure the destination of the borrowers’ USD 533 million, purportedly with the intent of impeding and protracting creditors’ efforts.
“For the record, the Byju’s entities are not parties to the proceedings mentioned in the recent media reports, and have not been served with copies of the complaint or motion. This is the first that we are hearing of these proceedings. The court filing appears to have been made prior to the latest loan repayment proposal. The parties continue to engage in negotiations to settle the dispute, and we remain committed to an amicable outcome,” the spokesperson said.
Byju’s had in November 2021 raised USD 1.2 billion term loan from a consortium of US-based creditors. In June this year, it missed a USD 40 million interest payment.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since then, Byju’s has been negotiating with its TLB (Term Loan B) lenders to find an amicable resolution. Earlier this week, it proposed to sell two of its assets – Great Learning and Epic – to repay the loan.
“As a matter of fact, the Delaware court ruling in June this year rejected the lenders’ application for information in relation to the amount in question i.e. part of the funds received by Byju’s Alpha, the borrowing entity under the TLB,” the spokesperson said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/startups/byjus-hid-533-mn-obscure-hedge-lenders-edtech-not-proscribed-move-funds-8938248/,business

Speaking at the ACMA annual session here, Takeuchi also emphasised on making the operations environment friendly.
“Today, India has become the third largest automobile market in the world. Going ahead, it is estimated that, by FY30-31, the annual passenger vehicle market size will expand to 6 to 7 million units,” Takeuchi said.

This means the scale of operations will nearly double from the present levels, he added.
“Our businesses will therefore need to be reviewed and re-aligned to the new and much higher scale of operations which will spread across multiple locations. At the same time, we need to find ways to make our operations sustainable and environmentally friendly,” Takeuchi noted.
He also urged the domestic component industry to work towards strengthening local design and development capability and also enhance skills of the existing manpower in order to diversify and grow business.
Takeuchi also emphasised on increasing competitiveness and having greater focus on capacity and capability in the automotive component sector.

He noted that globally, there are developments around sustainability, and these are leading to adoption of new technologies and fuels thus presenting a big opportunity especially for the Indian auto component manufacturers.
“So far, you have been one of the epitomes for ‘Make in India’. Now, having acquired the manufacturing prowess we have to move towards ‘Design in India’,” Takeuchi said.
He also emphasised the importance of having skilled human resources to meet volume and technology aspirations.

“India has a huge talent pool but to make them industry ready there is a greater need to collaborate across the value chain. Here, I request active support from the government as well,” Takeuchi said.
It is also important to strengthen Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) capabilities to unlock greater value for business, he added.
“Strengthening ESG capabilities will not only make us future ready and increase competitiveness but will prepare us for the upcoming regulatory compliances,” Takeuchi said.
He also asked the auto components industry to keep re-investing in their core businesses.
“For sustainable business operations and to benefit from the growing automobile market, re-investing in the core business and futuristic technologies is very important. We need to invest more in the automobile business,” he noted.

With higher scale, new technologies, multiple locations, and external uncertainties the complexity of business is going up, he said.
“To ensure continuity in such a scenario it is very important that we keep strengthening our risk management capabilities,” he added.

UK economy fares worse than expected in July as strikes weigh,"All major sectors in the UK -- services, manufacturing and construction -- declined in July, official data showed.","Britain’s economy contracted at the fastest pace this year in an unexpectedly poor reading for the month of July, with strikes in hospitals and schools weighing on output, official data showed on Wednesday.
The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product shrank 0.5% in July from June, worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.2% from June.

“Bullish demand outlook by the OPEC and the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) prediction of a decline in global oil inventories reinforced market views of tightening supply going forward,” said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.
The news of OPEC member Libya shutting four of its eastern oil export terminals due to a deadly storm also lent support to oil prices, he added.
“But further gains may be limited as there is also downside pressure from lingering worries over weaker demand in China,” Yoshida said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stuck to its forecasts for robust growth in global oil demand in 2023 and 2024, citing signs that major economies are faring better than expected despite headwinds such as high interest rates and elevated inflation.

The top court asked Singh to pay USD 5,00,000 towards an instalment to the Swiss firm along with USD 1 million defaulted amount. “We have to move to the next drastic step. We are not worried even if you shut down,” a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah observed.
Irked over the “dilly-dally business”, the bench told Singh he will have to abide by the consent terms and warned, “We are not bothered even if you die. It is too much. We will send you to Tihar jail, if you do not pay.” The court’s fulmination came on Monday when it asked Singh and the company secretary of SpecieJet to be present during the hearings and make the payment.

According to the Swiss firm, SpiceJet had availed the services of SR Technics, Switzerland, for maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aircraft engines, modules, components, assemblies, and parts, which were mandatory for its operations. An agreement for such services was entered into between SpiceJet and SR Technics on November 24, 2011 for 10 years. The terms of payments were also agreed upon. SR Technics had given Credit Suisse the right to receive payments from SpiceJet for the services.

Aluminium rail coaches: Hindalco ropes in Italian firm Metra for extrusion tech,The Aditya Birla group company in a statement said the partnership is aimed at sharing extrusion and fabrication technology for building high-speed aluminium rail coaches.,"Hindalco Industries, the world’s largest aluminium rolling and recycling company, on Tuesday said it has signed a technology partnership agreement with Italy-based Metra to manufacture high-speed aluminium rail coaches.
The Aditya Birla group company in a statement said the partnership is aimed at sharing extrusion and fabrication technology for building high-speed aluminium rail coaches.
For the last six decades, Metra has been known for its cutting-edge knowhow in aluminium extrusion, machining and welding, and the collaboration is a pivotal move to bring world-class technology – currently limited to Europe, China, Japan and a few other countries – to the domestic market.

“We are joining hands with Metra to introduce a new era of aluminium extrusions for passenger trains in the country,” said Satish Pai, Managing Director of Hindalco.
“This is in line with our capability building for aluminium in commercial vehicles, freight wagons, electric vehicles and passenger train applications. Our combined expertise will enhance the efficiency, durability and sustainable performance of these trains and set new benchmarks for the domestic rail industry,” he added.
In the railway sector, extruded aluminium plays a leading role, as it reduces weight of the coaches.
“Collaborating with Hindalco presents an exciting opportunity to showcase our capabilities for aluminium extrusion technology on a global stage,” Enrico Zampedri, the CEO of Metra, said The Railways is in the midst of a makeover in basic infrastructure such as rail lines and stations as well as the introduction of high-speed air-conditioned carriages.

To help make passenger coaches for the Vande Bharat trains, Hindalco plans to invest Rs 2,000 crore for the project and the technology alliance will provide the cutting-edge technology for this effort, Pai said.
Toughened high-grade aluminium alloy has emerged as the metal of choice the world over in manufacturing high-speed railway coaches, enabling aesthetic designs and greater speeds because of their lighter weights. Suburban metro systems and high-speed intercity and long-haul rail traffic in Europe, China and Japan use aluminium railcars.
While the upfront costs are marginally higher for aluminium railcars, the saving over the longer run including in rail infrastructure and carbon emissions, is significant. The use of aluminium significantly enhances energy efficiency thanks to reduced aerodynamic resistance, transmission loss and causes lower wear and tear to rolling stock.

Last October, Hindalco launched the country’s first all-aluminium lightweight freight rake, which is not just enabling higher speeds and more payload per trip but will save over 14,500 tonne of CO2 over its lifetime.
The company plans to introduce three more designs of freight wagons in the coming months targeting specific commodities such as cement and foodgrain.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/aluminium-rail-coaches-hindalco-ropes-italian-firm-metra-extrusion-tech-8936521/,business

No such proposal underway: Nitin Gadkari on additional 10% GST on sale of diesel vehicles,Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said that there is not any proposal under active consideration by the government over an additional 10 per cent GST on the sale of diesel vehicles.,"Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said that there is not any proposal under active consideration by the government over an additional 10 per cent GST on the sale of diesel vehicles.
Issuing a clarification on X, formerly Twitter, the minister said, “There is an urgent need to clarify media reports suggesting an additional 10% GST on the sale of diesel vehicles. It is essential to clarify that there is no such proposal currently under active consideration by the government.”
This comes after media reports stated that the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister while speaking at the 63rd Annual SIAM convention in New Delhi said that he will seek a “pollution tax” in the form of additional GST of 10 per cent on diesel vehicles and gensets in order to cut down on air pollution.

“I am going to handover a letter to the Finance Minister this evening stating that an additional 10 per cent GST be put on diesel-powered vehicles,” Gadkari said, adding that said the rising level of pollution is a health hazard for citizens, PTI quoted.
At the event, Gadkari said, “Say goodbye to diesel… Please stop making them, otherwise we will just increase the tax so much that it would become difficult to sell diesel cars.” He said he will propose additional GST on diesel-powered generators as well.
In his clarification on X, Gadkari wrote, “In line with our commitments to achieve Carbon Net Zero by 2070 and to reduce air pollution levels caused by hazardous fuels like diesel, as well as the rapid growth in automobile sales, it is imperative to actively embrace cleaner and greener alternative fuels. These fuels should be import substitutes, cost-effective, indigenous, and pollution-free.”

New Alibaba Group CEO Eddie Wu lays out strategic priorities for staff,"New Alibaba Group CEO Eddie Wu has told staff the tech giant's two main strategic focuses going forward will be ""user first"" and ""AI-driven.""","New Alibaba Group CEO Eddie Wu has told staff the tech giant’s two main strategic focuses going forward will be “user first” and “AI-driven”, according to an internal letter reviewed by Reuters.
Wu, who sent the letter on Tuesday, his third day in the top job, also said Alibaba would focus on promoting young employees, specifically citing those born after 1985, to form the core of its business management teams within the next four years.
This would help maintain a “start-up mindset” and prevent the company getting “stuck in our old ways”, he said.

The new CEO, one of Alibaba Group’s founders and long-time lieutenant of former chief Jack Ma, is laying out his strategic priorities at a key moment for Alibaba, which is undergoing the biggest organisational restructure of its 24-year history.
Late on Sunday Alibaba also announced that Wu would concurrently serve as CEO of its cloud computing unit, replacing Daniel Zhang.
The news came as a surprise to many, as Zhang had said in June he was stepping away as CEO of Alibaba Group to focus on the cloud division, which is aiming to have an IPO by May 2024.
The Cloud Intelligence Group, valued at $41 billion to $60 billion this year, is among five units Alibaba is spinning off as part of its restructuring.

The cloud unit is Alibaba’s second-biggest revenue source after domestic e-commerce and houses the group’s generative artificial intelligence model, Tongyi Qianwen.
“Over the next decade, the most significant change agent will be the disruptions bought about by AI across all sectors,” Wu said in the letter.
“If we don’t keep up with the changes of the AI era, we will be displaced.”

Alibaba beat analyst expectations in its first-quarter earnings report last month, but its recovery from a two-year regulatory crackdown has been complicated by the dual challenges of rising competition and a slowing Chinese economy.
Economic headwinds have helped drive more domestic e-commerce consumers to low-cost platforms, such as PDD Holdings Pinduoduo and ByteDance’s Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, prompting Alibaba’s domestic e-commerce arm to focus on value for money segments.
The cloud unit reported revenue growth of 4% for the quarter, the smallest among the group’s six business units, but analysts estimate it is China’s largest cloud provider with a 34% market share, ahead of Huawei Technologies, Tencent Holdings and Baidu.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/new-alibaba-group-ceo-eddie-wu-lays-out-staff-strategic-priorities-8936027/,business

‘Not bothered even if you die’: SC warns SpiceJet of ‘drastic action’ if Credit Suisse dues unpaid,"Credit Suisse and SpiceJet have been engaged in a legal dispute since 2015 over the bank's claim of unpaid dues of around $24 million, which led to the Madras High Court's order that the airline be wound up in 2021.","The Supreme Court on Monday directed SpiceJet to pay $1.5 million in a case related to unpaid dues to Credit Suisse by Sept. 15 and warned the budget airline of unspecified “drastic action” at the next hearing if it failed to do so.
A third of the amount is part of a monthly settlement plan SpiceJet had previously agreed with Credit Suisse, and the rest are unpaid dues to the bank which have accrued since last year after the airline failed to keep up with the payment schedule.
If SpiceJet fails to pay, the Supreme Court will take “drastic action” at the next hearing on Sept. 22.

“Enough of this dilly-dally business … We are not bothered even if you die,” one of the two judges said during the hearing which was attended by SpiceJet chief Ajay Singh.

Addressing a joint press conference with UK Chancellor of Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said both sides intend to expedite the free trade agreement.
“There is definitely some discussion on the FTA…the key on both the sides is to conclude it as soon as possible,” she said at the conclusion of the 12th India-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue.

“Alongside that, there is a new Pensions and Insurance Partnership, the establishment of knowledge and expertise-sharing and the new UK Infrastructure Financing Bridge and a deepened partnership on the developmental GIFT City.

"Mutual fund SIPs touch record high in August, RBI’s CRR move impacts debt AUMs: AMFI","Investors poured in a record Rs 15,813 crore in August through systematic investments plans (SIPs) route offered by mutual fund players, an industry body said on Monday.","Investors poured in a record Rs 15,813 crore in August through systematic investments plans (SIPs) route offered by mutual fund players, an industry body said on Monday.
The Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) also said there was a net outflow of Rs 25,872 crore from the income or debt oriented schemes in August.
Its chief executive N S Venkatesh told reporters that the Reserve Bank’s incremental cash reserve ratio (CRR) measure to suck out excess liquidity “partially impacted” the industry’s performance on the debt side as such schemes are looked at more from a treasury management perspective by banks as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
The previous monthly high of SIPs inflows was Rs 15,244 crore in the preceding month of July. Venkatesh said the overall assets under management (AUM) for SIPs were Rs 8.47 lakh crore at the end of August and a record 35 lakh new SIPs were started in the month.
Venkatesh said the record high SIP flows suggests that retail investors continue to invest in the market, and added that he expects the same trend to continue in the future as well on factors like strong economic growth which will help market sentiment.
The overall AUM for retail investors’ bets on equity and hybrid schemes was at Rs 24.38 lakh crore across 12.30 crore portfolios as at end-August.
There was also a record 19.58 lakh SIPs discontinued or matured in August, Venkatesh said, adding the same stood at over 17 lakh in July.
ADVERTISEMENT
The MF industry’s overall AUM grew to Rs 46.93 lakh crore in August, as against Rs 46.37 lakh crore in July.
In an SIP, an individual invests at periodic intervals like once a month starting from Rs 500 onwards. The 43-player industry has a high reliance on SIP flows.
Meanwhile, Venkatesh said the dip in debt AUMs does not point to any trend as it can be the result of the ongoing treasury operations.
ADVERTISEMENT
There was a Rs 348 crore fall in large cap schemes’ AUMs, Venkatesh said, adding that he expects a reversal in it soon and the same will be driven by higher earnings growth.
He asserted that the continuing interest in small and mid-cap equity schemes – they showed growth of Rs 4,264 crore and Rs 2,512 crore, respectively in August – is not an “irrational exuberance” by investors, and pointed out to a 60 per cent dip in asset prices which investors seem to be looking at while taking their calls.
In a first in many months, gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw an inflow of over Rs 1,000 crore, which was attributed by Venkatesh to investors taking advantage of a dip in bullion prices lately.

Indian pharma industry to log in 8-10% revenue growth this fiscal: Crisil,"A study of 186 drug makers, which accounted for about half of the Rs 3.7 lakh crore annual revenue of the sector last fiscal, indicates as much, Crisil said on Monday.","The Indian pharmaceuticals industry is expected to log in a revenue growth of 8-10 per cent in current fiscal aided by a steady domestic growth and increased exports to regulated markets, even as semi-regulated markets face headwinds, according to a report.
A study of 186 drug makers, which accounted for about half of the Rs 3.7 lakh crore annual revenue of the sector last fiscal, indicates as much, Crisil said on Monday.
“Similar to last fiscal, domestic growth in fiscal 2024, will be led by 5-6 per cent increase in realisations, supported partly by high price hikes allowed by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) for drugs under price regulation,” Crisil Research Director Aniket Dani said.

In addition, sale of existing drugs and new launches will drive 3-4 per cent volume growth, he added.
Operating profitability is also seen improving 50-100 basis points (bps) to 21 per cent this fiscal, supported by moderation in input and logistics costs, and abating pricing pressure in the US generics market, it said.
This follows two consecutive years of margin contraction due to high pricing pressure in the US and a sharp rise in input costs caused by supply chain disruption during the Covid pandemic, and thereafter, Crisil noted.
Credit profiles will remain stable owing to low-leverage balance sheets and moderate capex plans, it stated.

In the ongoing fiscal, domestic sales are expected to witness 8-10 per cent growth with the chronic segment expected to be the key contributor to revenues, because of the steady increase in lifestyle-related diseases and continued emphasis on health awareness, post the pandemic, Crisil said.
Formulation exports are seen up 7-9 per cent in rupee terms this fiscal, more driven by volumes, from new product launches, and abating price pressure in the US generics markets, it said.
On the other hand, increase in claw-back taxes in select European markets could lead to lower growth in exports to Europe this fiscal, it added.

“Growth in exports to Asia will improve this fiscal, after clocking a modest growth last fiscal, while exports to Africa will continue to remain sluggish on account of low forex reserves (impacting the purchasing power) and high currency volatility,” Crisil said.
Lower input prices and normalisation of supply chains should cull inventories to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in smaller incremental working capital debt this fiscal, it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/indian-pharma-industry-revenue-growth-this-fiscal-crisil-8934640/,business

"RBI, banks plan new features to boost CBDC transactions: Report","Retail CBDC transactions are averaging close to 18,000 a day, way short of the RBI's one million-a-day target by 2023 end.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is working with lenders to introduce new features to popularise the central bank digital currency (CBDC), the so-called e-rupee, according to six people familiar with the matter.
Retail CBDC transactions are averaging close to 18,000 a day, way short of the RBI’s one million-a-day target by 2023 end.
The features include allowing digital rupee transactions when a customer is offline and linking the e-rupee to India’s popular Unified Payments Interface (UPI), three of the people quoted above said.

UPI is an instant real-time payments system that allows users to transfer money across multiple banks without disclosing bank account details.

The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The RBI has been urging banks to make the e-rupee inter-operable with UPI through a QR code, said two of the bankers quoted above.
The interoperability will allow payments to flow via already well-distributed UPI QRs, they said.

The facility, announced in June, has been activated by large banks, including State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender.
“Interoperability of UPI QR Code with digital rupee will remove friction … but this will not drive adoption unless CBDC payments are incentivised,” said Sharat Chandra, co-founder of India Blockchain Forum, an industry collective.
The RBI and banks are also discussing ways to allow the use of e-rupee when a customer and a merchant are offline, according to two sources involved in the pilot project.

While the RBI is examining technology proposals, it hasn’t approved any of them, said the source familiar with the matter.
Top private lender HDFC Bank is working with a technology firm IDEMIA to build a version of offline CBDC transactions for feature phones, according to two people aware of the plans.
HDFC Bank declined to comment.
CBDC’s new and unique use cases such as its offline mode would facilitate transactions without network connectivity, said Akhil Handa, a top executive at Bank of Baroda.
“As new features get added, a gradual pickup in retail CBDC transaction volumes will follow,” said Handa.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-banks-plan-new-features-boost-digital-currency-transactions-8934317/,business

Benchmarks fell in Hong Kong and Tokyo but rose in Shanghai, Sydney and Seoul.
A surge in oil prices has added to worries that inflation may not be waning as hoped in the US and other major economies.

That could lead the Federal Reserve and other central banks to keep interest rates higher for longer, which would hurt prices for shares and other investments.
Over the weekend, China reported a slight increase in its own inflation data, suggesting deflationary pressures seen as a sign of weakness in its slowing economy might be easing. The government is due to report industrial output for August later in the week.
“We expect inflation to rebound further over the coming months, as policy support drives a modest recovery in China’s economic momentum,” Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.6 per cent to 3,133.85, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.4 per cent to 17,940.08.

Early Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.30 per cent, up from 4.2 per cent late Friday.
The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose to 5.001per cent, from 4.97 per cent.
Inflation has been generally cooling since peaking above 9 per cent last summer, but the worry is the last bit of improvement to get to the Fed’s 2 per cent inflation target may prove the most difficult.
High interest rates are supposed to slow the economy and hurt the job market, which should ultimately help undercut inflation.
But the highest rates in more than two decades have yet to do that with great effect.
The threat is that could push the Fed to raise rates again and at the very least to keep them high for longer than investors expect.
“The primary driver of this underlying inflation concern has been the relentless surge in oil prices. Adding to this complex mix, the limited US economic data available last week yielded some surprisingly resilient figures,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a report.

Alibaba shares slide 4% after former CEO quits cloud unit,The Hong Kong-listed shares of China's Alibaba Group fell more than 4% on Monday after the surprise departure of former CEO Daniel Zhang from the technology giant's cloud computing business.,"The Hong Kong-listed shares of China’s Alibaba Group fell more than 4% on Monday after the surprise departure of former CEO Daniel Zhang from the technology giant’s cloud computing business.
Alibaba announced Zhang’s decision to depart the unit in an internal letter to staff seen by Reuters, with co-founder Eddie Wu becoming the unit’s acting CEO and chairman. Zhang also handed over the role of group CEO to Wu on Sunday as scheduled.
The unit is China’s largest cloud provider with a 34% share of the market, research consultancy Canalys said in June. It also houses DAMO Academy, Alibaba’s research arm for chips and artificial intelligence, and is set to be spun off from Alibaba by May next year as part of the group’s restructuring.
ADVERTISEMENT
Zhang had previously been concurrently heading the group as well as the cloud intelligence unit, and the company announced in June that he would leave his group roles to wholly focus on the cloud business.
Li Chengdong, head of e-commerce focused, Beijing-based Haitun think tank, said Zhang’s departure looked like a personal decision and came as Alibaba Cloud faces growing competition from state-owned telecom companies and Huawei Technologies , as well as a tighter regulatory environment. “Alibaba Cloud has lost some ground with government and state-owned enterprise clients, which were previously a stronghold for the company,” Li said.
“During his leadership tenure, Alibaba Cloud’s business did not improve significantly despite his efforts. Zhang likely realised that the challenges facing Alibaba Cloud’s lacklustre growth were beyond what he could influence or control as an individual executive.”
Li said he did not see Zhang’s departure as having much impact on Alibaba Cloud’s listing plans as it would ultimately depend on the unit’s business performance.
ADVERTISEMENT
Alibaba said it would continue to execute the spin-off plan under a separate, to-be-appointed management team.
Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee, said he viewed the development as positive as it would allow Alibaba and the cloud business to start from a “clean slate”.
Regarding the share price, he noted that macro and geopolitical concerns over China also weighed.
ADVERTISEMENT
Alibaba said in its letter that Zhang will continue to contribute to Alibaba by “channelling his expertise differently,” and that it will invest $1 billion into a technology fund that Zhang would establish. Alibaba also gave Zhang an “emeritus” title, a first in its history.
Analysts have estimated the cloud unit to be worth $41 billion to $60 billion but have said the reams of data it oversees could put it in the crosshairs of regulators at home and abroad.

“In Q1 of 2023-24, the discrepancy of 2.8 per cent has a plus sign. This indicates that the expenditure side has explained only 97.2 per cent of the income side. It does not mean that the 2.8 per cent that has yet to be explained does not exist,” Nageswaran said in an op-ed article.
“It exists and lends itself to being explained in subsequent quarters. Similarly, the preceding eight quarters have shown negative discrepancies. It means that the expenditure side has been over-explained and needs to be reconciled,” the article co-authored by senior government economist Rajiv Mishra said.

Over a long period, the negatives and positives offset each other, it said, adding that between 1Q FY12 and 1Q FY24, the CAGR of real GDP (quarter-on-quarter) between the two approaches (income and expenditure) was 5.3 per cent annualised.
Therefore, it said, “the insinuation that GDP is exaggerated does not hold ground. The income side approach has not always been higher than the expenditure side. There has been a fair distribution of discrepancies since 2011-12 within a range of 6.4 per cent to (-) 4.8 per cent. The latest quarter discrepancy lies well within that. This is easy to verify”.
The Chief Economic Advisor’s (CEA) comments were reposted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the microblogging site X.
“When statistical authorities reported a GDP contraction of around 25 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-21…it had reported one of the severest contractions in the history of Indian GDP data. That data suited naysayers…hence it was ‘credible’,” the finance minister said, quoting the CEA article.

The article was written in light of debates over India’s economic performance and economist Ashoka Mody, a Princeton University professor, raising concerns regarding the country’s GDP growth rate for the first quarter of the financial year 2023-24.
“Indian authorities are downplaying inconvenient macroeconomic facts so that they can celebrate seemingly flattering headline figures ahead of hosting the G20 summit. But, in covering up the growing struggles faced by the vast majority of Indians, they are playing a cynical and dangerous game,” Mody said in an article posted by Project Syndicate titled ‘India’s Fake Growth Story’.
Mody has contended that the National Statistical Office (NSO) is utilising selective data, which, when examined more comprehensively, yields a significantly lower GDP growth rate than the 7.8 per cent announced by the government last month.

Growth, in fact, is low, inequalities are rising, and job scarcity remains acute, Mody said in the article.
Observing that the balance sheet problems of the Indian corporate and financial sectors in the last decade had hampered India’s economic growth, Nageswaran said that is now history and banks are lending with credit growth in double digits. Companies are beginning to invest.
India’s management of the Covid pandemic without excessive fiscal and monetary loosening, but with an emphasis on targeted relief and accent on public capital expenditure has provided a foundation of economic stability on which the edifice of sustained economic growth and higher living standards will rise in the coming years, Nageswaran said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/cea-anantha-nageswaran-rejects-statistical-discrepancy-criticism-q1-growth-numbers-8930623/,business

A recently published survey titled the ‘BankBazaar Aspiration Index’ which studies respondents under five aspirations of health, wealth, fame, relationship, and personal growth, presents some interesting trends. One such trend highlights that, on an average, women are borrowing more than men. Out of the total respondents, 91 per cent of the women had an open line of credit compared to 87 per cent of men.

India needs to grow at 8-9% for 20 years to become developed country by 2047: Deloitte,"India needs to grow at 8-9 per cent for the next 20 years to become a developed nation by 2047 as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deloitte South Asia Ceo Romal Shetty said.","India needs to grow at 8-9 per cent for the next 20 years to become a developed nation by 2047 as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deloitte South Asia Ceo Romal Shetty said.
He said India can benefit from the ‘China plus one’ strategy as no other country can offer the scale and size of operations as is available here.
Referring to the space sector, Shetty said India already has 200 startups and can attract investments of USD 100 billion by 2040.

“We need to grow at 8-9 per cent till at least 2047 to become a developed economy…. moving away from middle income level… To grow at that pace is not easy. Very few countries in the world have been able to grow at a pace of 8-9 per cent year-on -year,” Shetty told PTI.
Modi in an interview to PTI recently said India will be in the top 3 economies in the near future.
“By 2047, I am sure that our country will be among the developed countries. Our economy will be even more inclusive and innovative,” he had said.
India is currently the fifth largest economy in the world, after the US, China, Japan and Germany. An S&P Global report had last month projected India’s economy to double to USD 6.7 trillion by 2031, from USD 3.4 trillion currently.

Shetty also said India can look for opportunities in the agriculture, space sectors, and other sunrise areas like semiconductor and EVs. He further said the country is building roads at a ‘frantic pace’ of 16,000-18,000 kilometre a year, which in turn boosts development and trade.
“Multinational companies are looking at ‘China plus one’. There is no doubt about that. While there are other countries that will benefit when companies decide to move their manufacturing to somewhere else apart from China, no other country has the scale and size as India has,” Shetty added.
He said the big challenge that India is facing is import of crude oil. Similarly, even though technology has transformed the country, it can be divisive and there are biases in Artificial Intelligence (AI). “These are things we should be concerned about”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-needs-grow-8-9-20-years-become-developed-country-2047-deloitte-8930080/,business

Choosing to be non-executive chairman of HDFC was my biggest challenge: Deepak Parekh,"""No age or time is bad enough to start a business or venture. All you need is a good idea and clarity of thought and perseverance to succeed,"" Deepak Parekh said.","Veteran banker Deepak Parekh on Thursday said the biggest challenge for him was choosing to be a non-executive chairman of HDFC 13 years ago when he turned 65, a decision which he “still regrets, but is also happy about”.
In a fireside chat with BCG India Chairman Janmejaya Sinha on the third and final day of the Global Fintech Summit, Parekh also said that he has no such plans as he does not have the “thick skin to be a politician”.
He was responding to a query on whether he has any plans to enter politics.
ADVERTISEMENT
While mentioning about his decision to relinquish his position as the chairman in 2010, Parekh said the HDFC board as well as his family were against the move.
“But I chose to do so because had I stayed on, it would have closed the door on my the next-in-line leadership to grow and move to the corner room in the Ramon House (HDFC headquarters in south Mumbai),” Parekh, now 78, said.
“As a result, which I regret to some extent now, for the past 13 years ending June 30 this year, I didn’t draw a single penny in salary, nor got any ESOP, which 4,000 of our employees hugely benefited from,” he said.

“But that was a conscious call and I am happy that I did what I did,” he said.

He attributed the zero salary and ESOP to the internal policy of HDFC, where he joined as the tenth employee after it was founded by his uncle HT Parekh 46 years ago well after his retirement.
“No age or time is bad enough to start a business or venture. All you need is a good idea and clarity of thought and perseverance to succeed,” Deepak Parekh said.
Parekh, however, ruled out starting a new venture, and said he wants to work more for the HDFC Foundation.

Parekh has been a trouble shooter for successive governments and is also credited to have created the home loan market.
He said his biggest act of trouble shooting was the rescue of the scam-hit Satyam Computer Services in 2009.
Before diversifying the group into each new segment, “we looked at the borrower or the individual in his different stages of life,” he said and as the businesses grew, the bank entered personal loans, life, general and medical insurance and finally the education loan sectors.
“When we pioneered home loan, the board didn’t want to own more than 25 per cent in HDFC Bank as our equity capital was only Rs 50 crore and net worth was only Rs 100 crore.
“So, the board said after outrightly rejecting the idea that if you insist to launch a bank, we can only own 25 per cent, given our capital,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/non-executive-chairman-hdfc-biggest-challenge-deepak-parekh-8929552/,business

Domestic air passenger traffic to grow 8-13% this fiscal: Icra,"Domestic air passenger traffic is likely to grow 8-13 per cent in the current fiscal and the aviation industry is also expected to trim the losses further, credit rating agency Icra said on Thursday.","Domestic air passenger traffic is likely to grow 8-13 per cent in the current fiscal and the aviation industry is also expected to trim the losses further, credit rating agency Icra said on Thursday.
Icra, in its mid-year update on Indian aviation, also maintained a “stable outlook” on the industry, amidst the continued recovery in domestic and international air passenger traffic in FY2024, and improved pricing power of the carriers.
After the fast-paced recovery in FY2023, Icra said it estimates growth in domestic air passenger traffic in FY24 at 8-13 per cent, thus reaching 150-155 million passenger traffic, surpassing the pre-Covid levels of 141.2 million passengers in FY2020.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said that the domestic air passenger traffic during the first five months of the current fiscal stood at 63.2 million, witnessing a year-on-year growth of 20 per cent from 52.6 million a year earlier and 7 per cent higher than the pre-Covid levels of 58.9 million (5M FY2020).
The international passenger traffic for Indian carriers, according to the ratings agency, surpassed the pre-Covid levels in FY2023, although it trailed the peak levels of 25.9 million in FY2019.
It is expected to cross this level in the current fiscal, with an estimated 25-27 million passengers, Icra said.
“Given the fast-paced recovery of air passenger traffic in FY2023 and continuation of the same in the current fiscal, coupled with improved pricing power, the RASK-CASK spread of some of the Indian airlines turned positive since Q3 FY2023,” Suprio Banerjee, Vice President and Sector Head for corporate ratings at Icra Limited, said.

“The industry is thus estimated to report a significantly lower net loss of Rs 30-50 billion in FY2024 compared to an estimate of Rs 170-175 billion in FY2023,” he added.
Moreover, the industry witnessed a better pricing power, as reflected in improved yields and thus the revenue per available seat kilometre – cost per available seat kilometre (RASK-CASK) spread of the airlines, Icra said.
The pricing power is expected to continue with a YoY decline in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices since April 2023 (notwithstanding the recent uptick) and relatively stable foreign exchange rates, the rating agency said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/domestic-air-passenger-traffic-to-grow-8-13-this-fiscal-icra-8929062/,business

India removes additional duties on certain US products,"India has removed additional duties on about half a dozen US products, including chickpeas, lentils and apples, which were imposed in 2019 in response to America's decision to increase tariffs on certain steel and aluminium products.","India has removed additional duties on about half a dozen US products, including chickpeas, lentils and apples, which were imposed in 2019 in response to America’s decision to increase tariffs on certain steel and aluminium products.

In July, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Anupriya Patel in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha had said the government has decided to remove retaliatory customs duties on import of almonds (fresh or dried, in shell), walnuts, chickpeas, lentils, apples, medical diagnostic reagents, and boric acid.

US wants G20 to help reshape multilateral development banks like IMF and World Bank,White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communication John Kirby said on Wednesday the US will make it clear during President Joe Biden's visit to India that it remains committed to the G20 as a critical forum for all the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving.,"The US wants the G20 countries to help reshape and scale up multilateral development banks like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a top White House official has said.
White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communication John Kirby said on Wednesday the US will make it clear during President Joe Biden’s visit to India that it remains committed to the G20 as a critical forum for all the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving.
President Biden will arrive in New Delhi on Friday to participate in the G20 Summit.

“One of our main goals heading into the G20 is to help reshape and scale up multilateral development banks like the IMF, like the World Bank,” Kirby told foreign reporters at a news conference here on Wednesday.
“We know that these institutions are some of the most effective tools for mobilising transparent and high-quality investment in developing countries. And that’s why the United States has championed the major effort that is currently underway to evolve these institutions so that they’re up for the challenges of tomorrow,” he said.
Kirby said Biden asked the US Congress last month for additional funds that would have the impact of helping increase World Bank financing by more than USD 25 billion, and the US is working with its partners to see if they can pursue similar contributions.
During his India visit, Kirby said, Biden will also be calling on G20 members to provide meaningful debt relief so that low and middle-income countries can regain their footing after years of stress on their economies and their people.

“We’ll also be making progress on other key priorities, from climate to health, and as I said at the very top, digital technology. In addition, we’ll spotlight the progress that we’ve been making on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment that the President calls PGII,” he said.
Kirby noted that there will be continued focus on how the G20 deals with Russia’s illegal and ongoing war in Ukraine.
“The reality is that Russia’s war has already had devastating social, and economic consequences, and the poorest countries on the planet are bearing the brunt of that,” he said.

During the summit, Biden will call for a just and durable peace – one founded in respect for international law, the principles of the UN Charter, and the precepts of territorial integrity and national sovereignty, he said. “We will also continue to emphasise that the United States will support Ukraine for as long as it takes to redeem these principles,” he said.
“Last but not least – and this is certainly important – you’ll see that the United States will make it clear that we remain committed to the G20 as a critical forum for all the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving.
“The G20 itself, as a valuable and vital, as I said, venue, will be on the agenda. And in a sign of that commitment, the United States is looking forward to hosting the G20 ourselves in 2026,” said the White House official.
The G20 member countries represent around 85 per cent of the global GDP, over 75 per cent of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population.
The grouping comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the US and the European Union (EU).",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/us-g20-help-reshape-multilateral-development-banks-imf-world-bank-8928426/,business

Issuing notice to the company on the plea by the GST Directorate, a three-judge bench presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud stayed the May 12, 2023, order of the HC.
The proceedings before the HC dealt with whether online games under the platform would be considered games of skill which attracts 19 per cent GST or one of chance, in which case 28 per cent GST would apply. According to Gameskraft, the majority of these games were rummy, which they argued had been previously held to be a game of skill. The GST department had argued that rummy was a game of chance and hence liable to taxation at 28 per cent
ADVERTISEMENT
The HC Single-Judge Bench order which upheld the company’s contention said that rummy being substantially a game of skill and not chance, it would not be considered gambling even if the players are playing for a stake.
Appearing for the GST Directorate Wednesday, Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman told the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that the HC order was against what was laid down in one constitution bench ruling and three other judgments of the SC.
The law officer also conveyed his concerns about what he said is the “condemnation” in the HC order for the Directorate’s action.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/supreme-court-stays-rs-21000-cr-gst-notice-to-gameskraft-8928076/,business

"Reliance Retail receives Rs 8,278 crore from Qatar Investment Authority, allots 6.86 crore shares","As per the deal, it has allotted 6.86 crore equity shares to QIA of RRVL, which is the leading retailer in the country, said a regulatory filing from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).","Reliance Industries on Wednesday said it has received Rs 8,278 crore from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) for around 1 per cent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), the retail arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led group.
As per the deal, it has allotted 6.86 crore equity shares to QIA of RRVL, which is the leading retailer in the country, said a regulatory filing from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
“Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd today received the subscription amount of Rs 8,278 crore from Qatar Holding LLC (QIA) and allotted 6,86,35,010 equity shares to QIA,” said RIL.

The investment is made by QIA’s wholly-owned subsidiary into India’s largest retailer at a valuation of Rs 8.278 lakh crore (USD 100 billion).
Earlier on August 23, RIL had announced divesting 1 per cent stake in RRVL to QIA for a consideration of Rs 8,278 crore (USD 1 billion).
Updating about the development, Reliance Industries had said: “QIA’s investment will translate into a minority equity stake of 0.99 per cent in RRVL on a fully diluted basis.” Last month in the AGM of Reliance Industries, its Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest in Reliance Retail.
Addressing shareholders, he had said if RRVL was listed on stock exchanges, then based on the current valuation, it would be among the top four listed entities in the country.
In less than three years, the valuation of Reliance Retail has doubled and the pace of this value creation is “unmatched globally”, Ambani had said.

Referring to around 1 per cent stake purchase by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) in Reliance Retail Venture Ltd (RRVL) by investing Rs 8,278 crore (USD one billion) at a valuation of USD 100 billion, Mukesh Ambani had said the company’s valuation has doubled in less than three years.
“Just for context, during our fund-raise in September 2020, the valuation of our retail business stood at Rs 4.28 lakh crore. In less than three years, the valuation of retail has almost doubled, notwithstanding the intervening Covid-19 pandemic.” RRVL is the holding company of the RIL’s retail business.
In 2020, RRVL had raised Rs 47,265 crore (around USD 6.4 billion) from global private equity funds for a 10.09 per cent stake, valuing the company at more than Rs 4.2 lakh crore.

The company had raised funds from Silver Lake, KKR, Mubadala, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GIC, TPG, General Atlantic and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund at a valuation of around USD 57 billion at that time.

"Tata seeks control of Haldiram’s, snack maker wants $10 billion valuation","Haldiram's, a household name in India, is also talking with private equity firms including Bain Capital about the sale of a 10% stake, two people briefed on the matter said.","Tata Group’s consumer unit is in talks to buy at least 51% of popular Indian snack food maker Haldiram’s but is not comfortable with the $10 billion valuation sought, two people briefed on the matter said.
If successfully concluded, a deal would see the Indian conglomerate directly compete with Pepsi and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail.
Haldiram’s, a household name in India, is also talking with private equity firms including Bain Capital about the sale of a 10% stake, they said.

Tata Consumer Products, which owns UK tea company Tetley and has a partnership with Starbucks in India, has baulked at the $10 billion valuation given that Haldiram’s annual revenue is around $1.5 billion, the sources said.
Tata Consumer shares surged and closed nearly 4% higher in Mumbai trade after Reuters reported news of the talks.

A third person with direct knowledge of the discussions said Tata wants to buy more than 51% but has told Haldiram’s that its “ask is very high.”
The potential acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Tata, the person said, adding: “Tata (Consumer) is seen as a tea company. Haldiram’s is huge in the consumer space and has a wide market share.”
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
ADVERTISEMENT
A spokesperson for Tata Consumer Products said it “does not comment on market speculation”. Haldiram’s Chief Executive Krishan Kumar Chutani and Bain declined to comment.
Family-run Haldiram’s traces its origins back to a tiny shop founded in 1937 and is well-known for its crispy “bhujia” snack sold for as little as 10 rupees across mom-and-pop stores.
It has almost 13% share of India’s $6.2 billion savoury snack market, according to Euromonitor International. Pepsi, famous for its Lay’s chips, also has around 13%.
ADVERTISEMENT
Haldiram’s snacks are also sold in overseas markets like Singapore and the United States. The company has around 150 restaurants selling local food, sweets and western cuisine.
Purchasing Haldiram’s would significantly expand Tata’s consumer products reach.
“If you want to suddenly grow big in size, no one better to provide access than Haldiram’s. No other brand attacks packaged food, and food services, with equal panache,” said Ankur Bisen, head of consumer and retail at Indian consultancy Technopak.
Tata’s consumer unit, which also sells salt, pulses and mineral water, had revenue of $1.7 billion in the past financial year. It is a relatively small part of the Tata Group, whose businesses span autos, aviation and hotels and which had combined revenue last year of some $144 billion.
Haldiram’s Chairman Manohar Lal Agrawal last year told CNBC TV18 in an interview the company wanted to attract private equity investors and debut on the stock market in 2-3 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
Haldiram’s – which has multiple registered companies in the country – had revenue of at least $981 million in the financial year ended March 2022, according to regulatory filings. The first two sources, however, said its revenue is now close to $1.5 billion and annual operating profit is around $200 million.
The $10 billion valuation sought by Haldiram’s for the deal translates to 6.6 times its annual revenue of $1.5 billion, sources said.

Haldiram’s smaller listed rival in India, Bikaji Foods International, has a market capitalisation of $1.5 billion, six times its annual revenue.

Automobile retail sales see 9% growth in August: FADA,"Automobile retail sales in India rose by 9 per cent in August aided by sales growth in all segments, including passenger vehicles and two wheelers, dealers' body FADA said on Tuesday.","Automobile retail sales in India rose by 9 per cent in August aided by sales growth in all segments, including passenger vehicles and two wheelers, dealers’ body FADA said on Tuesday.
The total retail sales across segments rose to 18,18,647 units last month, up 9 per cent, from 16,74,162 units in August 2022.
Passenger vehicle registrations increased by 7 per cent to 3,15,153 units last month from 2,95,842 units in August 2022.

“In the passenger vehicle segment, improved vehicle supply, bolstered by expanded customer schemes, has maintained positive market dynamics,” the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) President Manish Raj Singhania said in a statement.
Similarly, two-wheeler sales saw a jump of 6 per cent to 12,54,444 units as compared with 11,80,230 units in the same month last year.
“Despite positive growth, consumer sentiment remained ambivalent, impacting conversion rates and intensifying competition among key players,” Singhania noted.
Commercial vehicle registrations increased by 3 per cent to 75,294 units last month from 72,940 units in the same month last year.

“As the Indian automobile industry enters September, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic, shaped by a multitude of factors that vary across vehicle segments,” Singhania said.

The onset of the festive season, beginning with Onam, has uplifted market mood, improved liquidity and eased earlier bottlenecks in the supply chain across all categories, he added.
Lack of sufficient rainfall could precipitate a rise in inflation, adversely affecting consumer purchasing power and diminishing demand, Singhania stated.
This meteorological shortfall would not only jeopardise the yield of the ongoing kharif crops but also cast a shadow on the subsequent sowing season for rabi crops, he added.
“Such developments would be particularly inopportune as they would coincide with the peak of India’s festive season, notably Navratri and Deepawali, traditionally periods of heightened consumer activity,” Singhania said.

Tractor sales to grow by low single digits despite poor monsoon,Mahindra' and 'Swaraj' are independent tractor brands of M&M with separate sales teams and dealer networks.,"After three very good years on the back of successive bountiful monsoons, the current fiscal is likely to see tractor sales post low single-digit growth at best.
“Sales during April-August have been flat, with growth at minus 0.3 per cent year-on-year. Although area sown this time is higher for all kharif crops, except pulses, we have also had the driest ever August. A lot depends on rains over the next 15 days,” said Hemant Sikka, president (farm equipment sector) of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M).
April-June and September-November are the peak periods for tractor sales. That’s when farmers would have harvested their rabi (winter-spring) and kharif (post-monsoon) crops respectively, while preparing to sow for the next season. If the kharif crop output and prices are good, they would be encouraged to invest in tractors for the coming rabi planting season.

Those prospects don’t look great for now, with the country as a whole receiving 11.3 per cent below-normal rainfall during the current southwest monsoon season from June 1 till September 4. As things stand, the industry is set for “low single-digit sales growth” in 2023-24 (April-March), Sikka told The Indian Express at an event to unveil a new range of tractors under M&M’s ‘Swaraj’ brand.
Domestic tractor sales rose from 7.05 lakh units in 2019-20 to 8.99 lakh, 8.42 lakh and 9.45 lakh units in the following three fiscals. This was a period when India’s agriculture sector did well, growing even during Covid while the rest of the economy suffered lockdown disruptions.
The newly launched ‘Swaraj’ tractor models – 843 XM (42 horsepower), 742 XT (44 hp), 744 FE (45 hp), 744 XT (49 hp) and 855 FE (50 hp) – are priced between Rs 6.9 lakh and Rs 9.95 lakh.
“These tractors have engines with higher cubic capacity and torque. They also have enhanced hydraulic lift capacity and 6-speed power take-off to seamlessly handle heavy and modern farm implements. We are further providing the option of multi-speed 12+3 transmission independent PTO and 4-wheel-drive across the product range, along with a standard warranty of six years or 6,000 hours,” said Harish Chavan, CEO of M&M’s Swaraj Division.

Aman Sarin, Director & CEO, Anant Raj Ltd, said the growth in credit indicates that the real estate sector is growing and people are investing in the sector. “This also indicates that the banking sector is positive about real estate and willing to provide capital for construction of commercial and housing projects,” Sarin said.
A significant driver of housing demand is the rising importance of property ownership, buoyed by consumer confidence in the broader economic climate, Sarin said.
Real estate developers and consultants exuded confidence that the sales momentum in the real estate sector will continue. They are also bullish about bumper sales in the upcoming festive season. Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation, said: “The festive season typically brings optimism and increased real estate transactions.” The residential real estate sector is presently experiencing robust growth, and this trend is expected to persist, Jain said.
The concept of homeownership has evolved, with people viewing houses not just as a necessity but also as a lifestyle choice, an investment, and a means to create assets for future generations. The demand for superior housing is anticipated to keep rising in the foreseeable future, Jain said.

Sankey Prasad, CMD, Colliers India, said a major factor putting the Indian realty on a high growth trajectory is India’s rapid GDP growth which is growing upwards of 6-7% a year, far higher than developed countries such as the US and UK where the economy has inched closer towards slowdown. “Initiatives such as Make in India, Production Linked Incentive Scheme and Smart Cities and policy nudges in the form of Real Estate Regulatory Act and single-window clearance have played a crucial role in eliminating roadblocks, thereby fast-tracking growth of the industry,” Prasad said.
Prasad said the impact of global economic sluggishness is expected to be a mixed bag for real estate in the near term due to rising interest rates and slowdown in demand. The long-term demand is expected to remain strong as housing has become one of the most important assets post COVID pandemic, he said.
Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said the impressive loan growth in the real estate sector is a function of a large-scale demand revival across the board.
“The commercial office segment was reeling under the pandemic’s pressure last year as employers were contemplating strategies around complete work from the office, work from home, or a hybrid model. However, as the situation gained normalcy, employees returned to offices and the demand for good quality commercial offices is high this year,” he said.
The RBI’s All India HPI growth (y-o-y) inched up to 5.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023-24 from 4.6 per cent in the previous quarter and 3.4 per cent a year ago.

KVS Manian: ‘Don’t see the RBI raising rates at this point in time… deposit rates may go up’,"In an interview to HITESH VYAS, GEORGE MATHEW and SANDEEP SINGH, Manian says the current acceleration in inflation is due to transient items such as tomato and onion prices, and is unlikely to go out of hand.","The outlook on the Indian economy looks positive. There are green shoots visible in the economy with capacity being built in sectors such as logistics, pharma and healthcare, says KVS MANIAN, Whole-time Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
In an interview to HITESH VYAS, GEORGE MATHEW and SANDEEP SINGH, Manian says the current acceleration in inflation is due to transient items such as tomato and onion prices, and is unlikely to go out of hand. He feels the repo rate will stay at the current level. Given the tight liquidity condition, he believes that deposit rates may go up by 25-50 basis points over the year. Excerpts:
Given the global scenario, what is your outlook on the Indian economy?
ADVERTISEMENT
Generally, the outlook for India looks positive. We will grow in the 6-6.5 per cent range (for FY2024). There has been some worry about food inflation but I think it is mostly coming out of transient items like tomato and onion prices. I am not overly worried about inflation getting out of hand. It may be slightly more than expected at the beginning of the year but may not be high enough to warrant significant policy turnaround. It also means that policy rates will stay where they are. With inflation remaining elevated, the reduction (in rates) is out of the question.
However, the market rates will be slightly higher than what policy rates indicate. My sense is that the liquidity in the banking system will be marginally tight, and therefore, the deposit costs will tend to rise.
There are talks about a monsoon deficit, which means food inflation can remain high. Do you think there can be some tightening by the RBI if inflation persists?
I do not see them (the RBI) raising rates at this point in time. As I have said, if food inflation is contributed by transient items, I don’t think RBI will react unless they believe that it (high food inflation) will affect the core food items.
How much increase are you seeing in deposit rates?
ADVERTISEMENT
It is difficult to answer, but you should look at a 25 to 50 basis points (bps) rise in deposit rates over the year.
Will this put pressure on net interest margin?
NIM (net interest margin) is a combination of multiple things. If you ask, will there be downward pressure on NIM for the banking system? The answer is yes. But having said that, remember that on the asset side, you (banks) will also be able to pass on some rate increase (to borrowers). If costs rise, banks will try to pass it (rates) on. Banks will need to manage their NIMs. The actual impact on NIM will change from bank to bank depending on how well they manage the mix of their asset and liability sides.
The government is saying that private capex has started taking off. Do you agree with this?
ADVERTISEMENT
We are seeing green shoots. All corporates are talking about investments, and it is a matter of time before investments start coming in. There are sectors where investments are beginning to happen. Some sectors like renewables, roads and infrastructure have seen investments even during the last few years. We have seen capacity being built in sectors such as logistics, pharma, healthcare and chemicals. For capex to take off, big corporates from sectors like cement and steel need to put up big capacities, which is probably still some time away.
Where are you seeing growth opportunities?
At the sector level, the whole industry is banking on retail to grow rather than on corporate. If you look at corporate loan growth, excluding bank lending to NBFCs, it has been in single digits for the past many quarters. So, the overall banking sector has relied on the retail segment to grow, and I don’t think that will change immediately.
Most corporates are deleveraged and sitting on cash. Even for small brownfield investments, they are using cash that they already have. Only large greenfield investments could bring back corporates to borrow from the market, but this will take time. In the interim, I think the reliance will be on retail to grow.
How do you see growth in your corporate loan book?
In corporate loans, we have always maintained that we are fine with a growth of 15-20 per cent. Our market share in the corporate segment is 2.5-3 per cent, and we don’t see any problem in gaining some more market share.
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier, we had targeted large corporates, which we call corporate conglomerate group (CCG). We have made good progress in the segment and improved our market share. But beyond a point when you keep growing in the same segment, there is a worry about concentration risk. Our current strategy is to grow the segment below that – large and mid-corporates. It is a segment where you can easily have a 10 per cent share in lending; it gives us a good wallet share in multiple products and services of the corporate. We feel that the right risk-adjusted returns can be made in this segment, and we want to grow it.
You have earlier mentioned competitive pricing pressures in corporate loans. How is the situation now?
ADVERTISEMENT
From our perspective, we are highly focused on risk-adjusted returns and always look at pricing vis-à-vis the risks that we take. Therefore, I would expect tenor and lower ratings to be priced well.
But yes, we do see irrationality in that (pricing of loans). I don’t think the markets are pricing it well. Competition can drive you to be irrational because you want a deal and book growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
As the cost of funds are likely to have an upward bias from here on, I hope it will drive more rational behaviour among banks as they will have to build their costs into pricing. I am seeing pricing getting more rational going forward.
Are you seeing any signs of stress in corporate or retail sectors?
Not at all. One good thing is that the credit quality and asset quality environment look as good as it can get. We aren’t seeing any stress on the corporate side, absolutely zero. If you see the industry data, of course, there is some increase in stress on the retail side, but it is nothing to worry about. There is a marginal increase in stress levels in unsecured loans.
What are your strategies to grow your unsecured loan book?
Our unsecured loan portfolio is smaller than others in the industry. We had cut down our unsecured lending even before Covid, as we witnessed some weaknesses there. As we entered Covid and got out of it, our unsecured loan book was sub-5 per cent of our total balance sheet. We have been giving guidance that our unsecured book at 5 per cent is too low, and we would like to take it to mid-teens. We are already getting close to 11 per cent. Currently, we acquire 30,000-35,000 retail customers daily, largely either millennials or mass customers, and that has a propensity profile of spending rather than investing. The first product they look for is a credit card or a personal loan. We wouldn’t have lent to them a few years back, but with analytics and better underwriting processes, we now want to. We are also focusing on salaried customers where our share has been low. These customers also want a credit card or a personal loan. Our experience in the microfinance segment has also been good.
From the point of view of the management of NIM, we think the percentage of (unsecured loans) needs to go up. Given all this, we are clear that we want to continue to build the unsecured business, as we feel the risk-return trade-off is reasonable.
How is your credit card portfolio performing?
We intend to grow our credit card portfolio. We have steadily gained market share here both in issuance and spends. We want to be among the top three issuers of credit cards on an incremental basis. It is a focus area for us to grow. We want to focus on creating a preferred brand in this product. Our portfolio is doing quite well. We are trying to grow in all three segments – new-to-credit, salaried and higher-end.
Are you seeing delinquencies in the MSME sector rising, especially after interest rate hikes?
We are not seeing any signs of delinquencies in our MSME portfolio. If I compare our emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGC) vis-à-vis the non-ECLGS portfolio, we do not see any difference. In fact, by providing ECLGS relief, we have been able to maintain the quality of the portfolio. From an industry point of view, we are seeing some marginal increase but not a vast stress level. All banks are focusing on the MSME segment for growth. If there were that much stress, they wouldn’t be focusing on it. Most other banks are also not seeing any specific reasons to worry about the MSME portfolio.
Has the rise in interest rates impacted microfinance loans?
Microfinance is more or less a fixed-rate product. Actually, the rates don’t fluctuate much in products like microfinance, personal loans and credit cards. We don’t modify the rates in these segments that significantly. In our case, we are seeing pristine quality in the microfinance portfolio, no stress at all. The post-Covid portfolio quality has been quite good, even for the industry. So, it doesn’t look like there is any stress.
Are you comfortable lending to the NBFC sector?
We have always been conservative and never had any bad experiences in the NBFC sector. I think the sector is much safer today than it used to be in the past. It can attract capital quite easily now. There are private equity players willing to fund NBFCs due to their potential. We are quite positive about the sector.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/dont-see-the-rbi-raising-rates-at-this-point-in-time-deposit-rates-may-go-up-kvs-manian-8922876/,business

"Sebi to curb finfluencers to help investors get accurate, unbiased info","Under the proposal, finfluencers need to be registered with Sebi and adhere to specific guidelines.","The rise of financial influencers or finfluencers, who charge as high as Rs 7.5 lakh for a post on social media, introduced a new way for people to access and interpret financial information, and now they will soon come under the regulatory purview as Sebi proposed measures to curb their mushrooming numbers.
The proposed move by Sebi not only ensures that investors receive accurate and unbiased information but also helps in preserving authenticity and reducing fraud, Anand Rathi Wealth Deputy CEO Feroz Azeez told PTI.
Under the proposal, finfluencers need to be registered with Sebi and adhere to specific guidelines. Also, it has been proposed to ban unregistered finfluencers from partnering with mutual funds and stockbrokers for promotional activities.
ADVERTISEMENT
While many finfluencers provide valuable insights, there has been a growing concern over the potential risks associated with unregulated finfluencers who might offer biased or misleading advice. They usually work on a commission-based model.
“Finfluencers charge as little as Rs 10,000 to as much as Rs 7.5 lakh for an individual post, excluding tax. Influencer marketing agencies quote as much as Rs 20 lakh for a campaign, plus taxes, to entice their followers,” Azeez said.
In addition, many of them make money from referral fees or profit sharing for promoting the product, channel, platform, or services or get compensation directly from social media and other platforms.
To address the risk associated with finfluencers, Sebi floated a consultation paper late last month proposing to restrict the association of registered intermediaries or regulated entities with unregistered influencers. In an era where financial advice is increasingly disseminated through social media, the line between credible advice and misleading information can become blurred.
By requiring finfluencers to register with Sebi and adhere to specific guidelines, the regulator is setting a standard for accountability and expertise in the sector, Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research, PMS, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The regulatory move to address the role of financial influencers, or finfluencers in the financial sector is undoubtedly significant in enhancing investor protection and promoting transparency in the industry,” Anand Rathi Wealth’s Azeez said.
Also, the capital markets regulator has proposed measures on disrupting the revenue model for unregistered finfluencers and ensuring that they adhere to proper disclosure and disclaimer practices. This will help create a more accountable and reliable environment for investors seeking financial guidance, he said.
Finfluencers have significantly impacted their followers’ financial decisions in the last few years and thus Sebi’s proposed regulatory framework can make them accountable and responsible for the advice they provide, Tejas Khoday, Co-founder and CEO of FYERS, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Further, finfluencers registered with Sebi or stock exchanges or AMFI are expected to display their appropriate registration number, contact details, and investor grievance redressal helpline, and make appropriate disclosure and disclaimer on any posts.
Khoday said that the new regulations could help prevent conflict of interest and recommendation bias, which usually overlooks their followers’ risk profiles. However, it is also essential to balance regulation and innovation.
“The proposed rules should harness the power of digital media to increase the overall financial awareness of the population fairly and transparently without compromising the far-reaching social media penetration so far,” he added.
Also, the regulator has proposed to create a closed ecosystem for fee collection by Sebi-registered Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from their clients.
This ecosystem will help investors ensure that their payments are reaching only registered IAs and RAs. This would also help investors identify, isolate, and avoid unregistered entities, who would be unable to access this closed ecosystem.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-curb-finfluencers-investors-get-accurate-unbiased-info-8922048/,business
"LPG price cut, Ujjwala expansion could cost over Rs 37,000 crore annually","The government on Tuesday announced the price cut, which was implemented by public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Wednesday.","The government’s decision to slash domestic cooking gas prices by Rs 200 per 14.2-kg cylinder and expand the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) by adding 75 lakh poor households to its beneficiary base could cost upwards of Rs 37,000 crore on an annualised basis, an analysis of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumer base and average gas refill data suggests. For the computations, it is assumed that the LPG cylinder refill rates will stay at the levels recorded for 2022-23 (FY23) and fuel retailers will continue to sell LPG to households at a price that is Rs 200 lower than what they would have charged for a cylinder had the price cut not been announced.
On its part, the government has not provided any estimate of the cost of the twin decisions. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior official in the finance ministry said that the actual cost could be somewhat “lower” than this estimate as there are a number of variables in the equation. These include possible over recoveries on LPG sales by fuel retailers, movement in international crude and LPG prices going ahead, and currency fluctuations. The official, however, did not provide any estimation of what the actual cost might be.

"As Urals loses some sheen, India’s Russian oil imports slump in August","India’s total Russian oil imports fell 23.4 per cent month-on-month in August to 1.47 million barrels per day (bpd). Barring January, when cumulative Russian oil imports of Indian refiners stood at 1.27 million bpd, August volumes were the lowest this year.","With discounts on Russia’s flagship crude Urals having narrowed considerably in recent weeks coupled with lower oil purchases by Indian refiners due to maintenance shutdowns at some units, India’s import volumes of the medium-sour crude declined by nearly a third on a month-on-month (MoM) basis in August. This, in turn, resulted in New Delhi’s overall Russian oil imports falling to a seven-month low, shows an analysis of data shared by energy cargo tracker Vortexa.
Import volumes of Urals — the mainstay of India’s Russian oil import basket–declined to 1.08 million bpd from 1.60 million bpd in July. Even Urals import volumes were at a seven-month low in August. India’s total Russian oil imports fell 23.4 per cent month-on-month in August to 1.47 million barrels per day (bpd). Barring January, when cumulative Russian oil imports of Indian refiners stood at 1.27 million bpd, August volumes were the lowest this year.
While Russia maintained its position as India’s top source of crude oil in August, its share in the country’s overall oil imports declined to 33.8 per cent during the month, down from a share of over 40 per cent seen over the previous three months. In August, India imported a total of 4.35 million bpd of crude, which was down 5 per cent MoM, according to Vortexa. Meanwhile, oil imports from Saudi Arabia–traditionally a major oil supplier to India–jumped nearly 70 per cent MoM to 820,000 bpd during the month.
ADVERTISEMENT
“India’s imports of Russian crude have fallen by over 20% month-on-month in August, driven by lower exports from Russia. Russian Urals discounts to dated Brent have narrowed with lower supplies in the market, which have likely dampened India’s appetite for the crude compared to the past few months,” said Serena Huang, head of Asia-Pacific analysis at Vortexa.
In July, the price of Urals as per international assessments breached the $60-per-barrel cap imposed by G7 countries and the discounts being offered by Russian oil exporters have eroded substantially. This appears to have negatively impacted India-Russia oil trade, which has been booming since Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Industry watchers expect Russia’s crude oil exports to remain subdued over the next few months, unless Moscow plans to reverse its production and export curbs, which are part of a larger coordinated action by the world’s major oil producers to support oil prices, and deepen discounts on its crude vis-à-vis global benchmarks and comparable West Asian crudes.
Russia began offering deep discounts on its oil exports as major Western economies started weaning themselves off Moscow’s crude. Indian refiners lapped up the opportunity, snapping up the discounted barrels in huge quantities, resulting in Russia emerging as India’s largest source of crude. Prior to the war in Ukraine, Russian oil had a share of less than 2 per cent in India’s oil import pie.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to industry insiders, while India’s Russian oil imports could decline further due to a combination of reduced exports from Moscow and erosion of discounts on Russian crude, there are ways to prevent a significant slide in volumes. That, however, would require Indian refiners as well as Russian oil exporters to work closely and show some flexibility on discounts as well as payment terms.
Sources in the Indian government have already indicated that public sector refiners are looking to increase oil purchases from their traditional West Asian suppliers of crude oil, given the significant erosion in discounts offered by Russia on its oil and the likelihood of payment-related complications if Urals is to be bought at over $60 per barrel on a regular basis. While Russia may not be too keen on it, analysts do expect Indian refiners to use the rise in price of Russian oil and the G7 price cap as leverage to negotiate deeper discounts with Moscow, given New Delhi’s newfound position as the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude.
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement of the commodity. Such a high import dependency makes Indian refiners and the country’s economy extremely sensitive to international oil prices, which in turn means that Indian refiners are continuously scouting for discounts and favourable pricing and payment terms in their oil purchases.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/as-urals-loses-some-sheen-indias-russian-oil-imports-slump-in-august-8920252/,business

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail in talks to raise $2.5 billion: Report,"Three sources said the target fund raise of $2.5 billion is part of a combined $3.5 billion target the firm has set for itself, a part of which — $1 billion — came from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and was announced last month","Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ventures is in advanced talks with global investors to raise around $2.5 billion by the end of September, ahead of a potential stock market listing, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Three sources said the target fund raise of $2.5 billion is part of a combined $3.5 billion target the firm has set for itself, a part of which — $1 billion — came from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and was announced last month.

Reliance last month said it raised $1 billion from QIA at a $100 billion valuation for India’s biggest retailer whose operations stretch from selling groceries to electronics, and include foreign partnerships with brands like Burberry and Pret A Manger.
Morgan Stanley is advising Reliance on the process, said two sources with direct knowledge. Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.
All the three sources declined to name potential investors. But the first source said Reliance was talking to at least two U.S.-based investors, while the other two sources said there was growing interest from existing foreign investors of Reliance, including some sovereign wealth funds.

The investment, if it materializes, will bolster India’s status as a rare bright spot for Western private investors who are shying away from new investments in China due to the country’s worsening economic outlook and geopolitical tensions.

In 2020, Reliance Retail raised $5.71 billion by selling a 10.09% stake to investors including KKR, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, General Atlantic and the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala.
Ambani said this week its 2020 fund raise valued the business at around $52 billion, and “in less than three years, the valuation of retail has almost doubled.”
A fourth source with direct knowledge said two Reliance fund raise announcements were likely within two weeks, and valuation of the company would be around the same at which QIA invested -around $100 billion. That implies a potential $2.5 billion investment will be equivalent to a 2.5% stake in the company.

“Several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest in Reliance Retail. I will update you about our progress with them in due course,” Ambani said on Monday during the company’s annual general meeting, without sharing further details.
Ambani said in 2019 that the group planned to list the retail business in five years.
Ambani’s daughter Isha Ambani leads the retail expansion. Reliance Retail has more than 18,000 retail outlets, but also a growing e-commerce operation where it competes with the likes of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart.

Moody’s ups India’s growth forecast to 6.7% for 2023 calendar year,Moody's Investors Service on Friday raised India's growth projection for 2023 calendar year to 6.7 per cent on account of robust economic momentum.,"Moody’s Investors Service on Friday raised India’s growth projection for 2023 calendar year to 6.7 per cent on account of robust economic momentum.
“Strong services expansion and capital expenditures propelled India’s 7.8 per cent real GDP growth in the second (April-June) quarter from a year ago. We have accordingly raised our 2023 calendar year growth forecast for India from 5.5 per cent to 6.7 per cent,” Moody’s said in its Global Macro Outlook.
“Given the robust underlying economic momentum, we also recognise further upside risk to India’s economic growth performance,” it added Moody’s said since the second quarter outperformance creates a high base in 2023, “we have lowered our 2024 growth forecast from 6.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent”.

India’s monsoon season which runs from June to October could also see below average rainfall, resulting in higher food prices. So far, as of August 29, the India Meteorological Department has estimated a 9 per cent rain deficiency across the country.
If El Niño this year proves to be particularly strong in the second half of 2023 and early 2024, agricultural commodity prices could shoot up, Moody’s added.
The Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee left the repo rate unchanged for a third time in August. The recent uptick in food price inflation and uncertain El Niño-related weather conditions will delay monetary policy easing consideration to early next year.
“Domestic demand in India remains buoyant, and as long as core inflation remains relatively stable, rate hikes are also unlikely,” Moody’s said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/moodys-india-gdp-growth-forecast-2023-calendar-year-8919217/,business
"Commerce ministry working on criteria for laptop, computer importers to provide licences in smooth ways: Official","As the government has decided to impose import curbs on these electronic devices, importers would have to seek a license from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) from November 1.","The commerce ministry’s arm DGFT is working on formulating criteria to provide licences in a smooth way to importers of laptops and computers, an official said.
As the government has decided to impose import curbs on these electronic devices, importers would have to seek a license from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) from November 1.
“We are working on the licensing issues. The aim is to make it smooth to get a license for imports,” the official said.

In similar cases earlier, criteria like past performance of a company have been used for granting licences.
The import curbs will help India to keep a close watch on the locations from where the products are coming.
The decision will also spur domestic manufacturing at a time when India has identified electronics manufacturing as a key priority area for its future growth ambitions and is hoping to attract investments from global biggies looking to diversify their operations outside China.
The PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme for IT hardware has attracted 38 companies, including Foxconn Group, HP, Dell and Lenovo. They have applied for incentives under the scheme for manufacturing laptops, PCs and servers.

Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has stated that the government should announce objective criteria for importers to seek licences for inbound shipments of these items to meet domestic demand.
GTRI co-founder Ajay Srivastava said that personal computers (PCs), laptops, and tablets “connect us to the world of education, business, entertainment and everything else” and therefore the government must take all steps to avoid short supply and market disruption.
“One way is announcing objective criteria that will constitute the basis for the grant of licence,” he said, adding that the government can inform all firms of their next year’s annual import eligibility in terms of the number of units and value in advance.

Earlier, the government imposed import curbs on tyres, television sets, air conditioners, and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigeration and air-conditioning.
The basic customs duties on laptop, PC and similar products in India is zero. India cannot increase this duty as it has committed to zero duty on computers and many IT-related products by signing an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in 1997 under the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The only option to check import was requiring firms to obtain the government’s permission before importing. Restricting imports is a more severe measure as the government can now restrict the value of imports or who will import, the GTRI has said in its report.
India’s imports of these products were USD 8.8 billion in 2022-2023. The two key products are PCs/laptops, tablets (imports of USD 5.3 billion), and Wi-Fi Dongles, Smart Card Reader, Android TV Boxes etc. (USD 2.6 billion).

Fiscal deficit a third of annual target in Q1
The Centre’s fiscal deficit widened to 33.9 per cent of the Budget estimate in the first four months of the current financial year, compared with 20.5 per cent in the year-ago period, due to a surge in revenue spending, capex and extra tax devolution to the state governments.
In absolute terms, fiscal deficit — the gap between expenditure and revenue — was `6.05 lakh crore as of end-July, according to data released by the Controller General of Accounts.

Net tax revenues contracted by 13 per cent, while non-tax revenues doubled due to a hefty Reserve Bank of India dividend. Non-debt capital receipts, however, declined 55 per cent due to lower disinvestment receipts.
Due to doubling of revenue spending in July on account of higher release of subsidies, spending rose 16 per cent annually in April-July to `10.64 lakh crore, against the annual budgeted growth rate of 1.5 per cent to reach `35 lakh crore in FY24. Despite the rate moderating to 15 per cent in July, capex growth was a robust 52 per cent in April-July, against the required rate of 36 per cent to meet the annual Budget target of `10 lakh crore.

"Services give fillip to growth, GDP up 7.8% in April-June","Capital formation, a proxy for investments, and private consumption expenditure, an indicator of consumption demand, posted growth rates of 8 per cent and 6 per cent in Q1 FY24, respectively.","INDIA’S REAL Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rose to a four-quarter high of 7.8 per cent in April-June, mainly due to a pickup in agriculture and services especially financial, real estate and professional services and contact-intensive services of trade, hotel and transportation, data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed. Manufacturing and construction sectors, however, recorded slower-than-expected growth rates.
Capital formation, a proxy for investments, and private consumption expenditure, an indicator of consumption demand, posted growth rates of 8 per cent and 6 per cent in Q1 FY24, respectively. These had recorded higher growth rates of 20.4 per cent and 19.8 per cent, respectively, in the corresponding period a year ago. As a share of GDP, private consumption expenditure dropped to 57.3 per cent of GDP in April-June from 58.3 per cent in the year-ago period.
Surprisingly, there was a contraction of 0.7 per cent in government expenditure in the first quarter this year — its share in GDP also decreased to 10.1 per cent of GDP from 11 per cent; exports also recorded a contraction of 7.7 per cent, while imports increased by 10 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Economists pointed out that the manufacturing sector’s growth is skewed more towards organised sector’s growth, a trend reflective of the ongoing recovery still not being broad-based enough. Going ahead, consumption demand may also get affected amid inflationary pressures and weak external demand, they said.
Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said India’s quarterly GDP growth is way higher than the GDP print of many other economies and that the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are comfortable in holding on to their FY24 GDP growth forecast of 6.5 per cent. He said the services sector has been the main driver of growth along with an uptick in capital formation. He said the government’s capital expenditure push is “paying off” and is crowding in private investment.
EXPLAINED
The monsoon factor
Going ahead, the government is concerned if it can sustain the growth momentum, given the lower than expected rain which may not just impact incomes, but also keep prices high and affect consumption demand in coming months.
“When I spoke to you at the end of May, I did say that compared to what we said in January in the Economic Survey, wherein we said that the downside risk factors were higher than the upside surprises to the 6.5 per cent forecast – the risks are now evenly balanced around our central expectation of 6.5 per cent. We maintain that view,” he said.
The RBI had projected a first quarter growth rate of 8 per cent, coming on the back of a 6.1 per cent growth in January-March and a 13.1 per cent growth in April-June 2022. “Real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; Q3 at 6.0 per cent; and Q4 at 5.7 per cent,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said earlier this month.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the latest data, five of the eight key sectors registered over 5 per cent growth in April-June, with two sectors recording a higher growth rate than the year-ago period — ‘financial, real estate and professional services’ at 12.2 per cent as against 8.5 per cent in the year-ago period, and ‘agriculture, forestry and fishing’ at 3.5 per cent as against 2.4 per cent.
Manufacturing grew at 4.7 per cent in April-June 2023 as against 6.1 per cent in April-June 2022, while mining and quarrying grew at 5.8 per cent, lower than 9.5 per cent a year ago. Construction sector grew at 7.9 per cent in April-June this year as against 16 per cent growth in the corresponding period last year.
Economists pointed out that the manufacturing sector’s growth is skewed more towards organised sector’s growth. “Manufacturing growth at 4.7% should be viewed more from the point of view of lower performance of the unorganised sector as profit growth and hence value addition has been high for the corporate sector which gets included here. The push is provided by the services sector where both trade, transport etc. and finance and real estate have grown by 9.2% and 12.2% in high base growth rates. The relentless uptick in PMIs gets reflected here where pent up demand has kept the mood up. This will tend to taper down in the coming quarters,” Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, said.

A broad-based recovery in private consumption is some distance away, India Ratings said. “The current consumption demand is skewed towards goods and services consumed largely by the households falling in the higher income bracket,” Sunil Kumar Sinha, Senior Director & Principal Economist, India Ratings said.
Going ahead, erratic monsoon and inflationary pressures could affect consumption demand, economists said. “The road ahead is not going to be easy so long as PFCE does not recover fully and become broad based. Also, the impact of El Nino on this year’s monsoon could bring agricultural growth under pressure and the spillover effect of this would be felt on food inflation. A government intervention in agriculture and drought relief measures could pressure and destabilise the fiscal arithmetic of FY24. Amidst these challenges, however, revival of private corporate capex is expected to bring relief to the economy,” Sinha said.
The GDP print could also have fiscal implications as the government’s budget metrics are linked to nominal GDP growth, which has come in just 0.2 percentage points higher than the real GDP at 8 per cent. Nominal GDP accounts for the inflation rate and the deflator for GDP is linked to the wholesale price index-based inflation, which has been in the negative territory for the last four months.
DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India, said, “The proximity of real GDP growth at 7.8% with nominal GDP growth at only 8% has significant fiscal implications. These growth rates imply that the implicit price deflator (IPD) based inflation is only 0.2%. Such a low IPD inflation is seen after 15 quarters.

"ONDC provides huge growth opportunities for financial services, manufacturing, e-commerce, agri sectors: Deloitte","The government's initiative ONDC is providing a huge platform for growth of four key sectors, including financial services, agriculture, manufacturing, and e-commerce retail, a Deloitte report said on Thursday.","The government’s initiative ONDC is providing a huge platform for growth of four key sectors, including financial services, agriculture, manufacturing, and e-commerce retail, a Deloitte report said on Thursday.
The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is an initiative of the commerce and industry ministry to create a facilitative model to help small retailers take advantage of digital commerce.
It is not an application, platform, intermediary or software but a set of specifications designed to foster open, unbundled, and interoperable open networks. The network aims at helping MSME players in the retail sectors to take advantage of the fast growing e-commerce space in the country.
ADVERTISEMENT
The report said that the ONDC presents an opportunity for financial institutions to engage with MSMEs segment that is mainly dependent on government schemes and non-baking financial companies (NBFCs) for credit as they are not deemed creditworthy by mainstream financial institutions.
The size of lending does not make it profitable for financial institutions to lend to this sector, and the lack of data related to MSMEs has meant that credit approvals, based on traditional decisioning models in most instances, get rejected.
“The ONDC ecosystem is expected to digitise the data available on SMEs (using the transaction data) with the help of financial technology services providers… The digitised data will enable financial institutions to develop better understanding of this client segment to tailor products and services,” the report/whitepaper titled ‘commerce@Bharat: Redefining business models and supply chain’, said.
It added that the increased adoption of ONDC in smaller cities and rural areas will open newer segments for banks and also drive tailored products and services catering to this segment’s needs.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The MSME segments have been traditionally dominated by regional players. ONDC opens up opportunities for digital-savvy financial institutions to cater to the segment,” it said.
A recent report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) committee on MSMEs stated that the sector has an estimated credit gap of Rs 20–25 lakh crore.
About the manufacturing sector, the report said that the manufacturing environment has become more challenging during and after the Covid pandemic with geopolitical tensions leading to changes in the trade landscape, supply chain disruptions, and component shortages and volatile commodity prices.
ADVERTISEMENT
“ONDC is likely to enable the manufacturing community to tap some of these opportunities and address challenges across the value chain,” it said, adding, with the availability of a large pool of logistics service providers on ONDC, organisations can optimise overall logistics cost and manage demand increase more effectively.
The network will help manage supply chain disruptions in the manufacturing sector as on ONDC, the original equipment makers can quickly identify alternative supply sources at competitive prices from an extensive pool of suppliers and order the component to ensure zero disruption in manufacturing operations.
It also said that with the increasing importance of online sales, the retail ecosystem (brands, retailers, distributors, suppliers) can use the network to connect within their ecosystem and with end consumers.
Over the past few months, categories such as grocery, food delivery, home and decor, electronics, fashion and lifestyle, beauty and personal care, and pharmaceuticals have been leveraging the ONDC network with support of multiple stakeholders.
“ONDC creates an opportunity for brands/retailers/MSMEs to efficiently and cost effectively address their demand and supplier connect. There are exciting possibilities in both B2B and B2C commerce,” it said, adding brands and retailers can use this network by onboarding their physical outlets and distribution points/warehousing.
ADVERTISEMENT
It added that the network can support brands to connect directly with their retailers and/or enable their distributors to expand their reach and coverage.
They can also provide features and services such as 24×7 ordering, next-day delivery, auto ordering, and credit management to their sales partners, the report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
It added that the ONDC can also offer brands/retailers to expand their supplier base and reduce cost of procuring raw materials or manufacturing products.
Further, about the agriculture sector, it said ONDC will provide an opportunity to accelerate technology adoption in agriculture throughout the country as it can integrate both buyers and sellers across the farm value chain onto a single network.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The network might come as a boon for agritech start-ups that face a challenge of discoverability. FPOs will get access to input, technology, equipment, and services from companies and government bodies,” it said.
Commenting on the report, Sathish Gopalaiah, President, Consulting, Deloitte South Asia, said that ONDC is a remarkable opportunity for India’s economy spanning diverse industries.
“With a unique proposition built around agility, security and profitability at the same time, ONDC streamlines value chains, bridges gaps, and endorses innovation, paving the way for the next generation to explore novel paths,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ondc-provides-huge-growth-opportunities-for-financial-services-manufacturing-e-commerce-agri-sectors-deloitte-8917474/,business
Adani Group stocks fall; Adani Green Energy declines over 4% after OCCRP report,Shares of Adani group stocks fell on Thursday after a report from investigative reporting platform OCCRP alleged hundreds of millions of dollars were invested in publicly traded group stocks through Mauritius-based 'opaque' investment funds managed by partners of promoter family of Gautam Adani.,"Shares of Adani group stocks fell on Thursday after a report from investigative reporting platform OCCRP alleged hundreds of millions of dollars were invested in publicly traded group stocks through Mauritius-based ‘opaque’ investment funds managed by partners of promoter family of billionaire Gautam Adani.
However, the conglomerate denied the charges vehemently.
On the BSE, the stock of Adani Green Energy nosedived 4.43 per cent to Rs 927.65 apiece, with a market capitalisation of Rs 1.47 lakh crore.
The scrip of Adani Power plunged 3.82 per cent to Rs 315.85, flagship firm Adani Enterprises declined 3.56 per cent to Rs 2,424 and Adani Energy Solutions fell 3.18 per cent to Rs 814.95 apiece on the bourse.

Shares of ACC dipped 3.15 per cent to Rs 1,937.10 and Ambuja Cements fell 2.84 per cent to Rs 431.60.
In the morning session, the 30-shares BSE Sensex was trading 38.32 points or 0.06 per cent lower at 65,048.93 points.
The fresh allegations by an organisation funded by likes of George Soros and Rockefeller Brothers Fund come months after a US short seller wiped away close to USD 150 billion in value of Adani group stocks with allegations of accounting fraud, stock price manipulation and improper use of tax havens by the ports-to-energy conglomerate run by billionaire Gautam Adani. Adani Group has denied all Hindenburg allegations.
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, OCCRP (Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project) said its investigation found at least two cases where the “mysterious” investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.
The two men, Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling, who OCCRP claimed have longtime business ties to the Adani family and have also served as directors and shareholders in Group companies and firms associated with Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani, “spent years buying and selling Adani stock through offshore structures that obscured their involvement – and made considerable profits in the process.” The documents “show that the management company in charge of their investments paid a Vinod Adani company to advice them in their investment”, it alleged.
Adani in a statement categorically rejected what it called as “recycled allegations”, calling them “yet another concerted bid by Soros-funded interests supported by a section of the foreign media to revive the meritless Hindenburg report”.

“These claims are based on closed cases from a decade ago when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) probed allegations of over invoicing, transfer of funds abroad, related party transactions and investments through FPIs. An independent adjudicating authority and an appellate tribunal had both confirmed that there was no over-valuation and that the transactions were in accordance with applicable law. The matter attained finality in March 2023 when the Supreme Court of India ruled in our favour. Clearly, since there was no over-valuation, there is no relevance or foundation for these allegations on transfer of funds,” it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/adani-group-stocks-fall-adani-green-energy-occrp-report-8917424/,business
"UBS to absorb Credit Suisse’s domestic bank, seeks $10 billion in cost cuts",The long-awaited announcement about Credit Suisse's home bank was made in tandem with UBS's first earnings report since taking over its stricken rival. The decision comes despite a likely backlash in Switzerland where it could result in the loss of thousands of jobs.,"UBS Group said on Thursday it would fully absorb Credit Suisse’s domestic bank, adding that it was increasing its ambitions for cost savings to more than $10 billion across the group.
The long-awaited announcement about Credit Suisse’s home bank was made in tandem with UBS’s first earnings report since taking over its stricken rival. The decision comes despite a likely backlash in Switzerland where it could result in the loss of thousands of jobs.
UBS could have spun off the business and floated it in an IPO but the domestic bank has been a solid profit-maker for Credit Suisse and last year it was the only division in the black.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Our analysis clearly shows that a full integration is the best outcome for UBS, our stakeholders and the Swiss economy,” Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said in a statement.
“The two Swiss entities will operate separately until their planned legal integration for 2024 with the gradual migration of clients onto UBS systems expected to be completed in 2025,” he added.
The prediction of over $10 billion in cost-savings by end 2026 compares with an earlier estimate of $8 billion by 2027. Most savings are set to come from reducing headcount.
Hanging on to existing Credit Suisse clients is seen as key if UBS is to successfully pull off the Herculean deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
Credit Suisse reported net asset outflows of 39 billion Swiss francs ($44.4 billion) in the second quarter, underscoring that the rescue has failed to stem the loss of confidence in its franchise.
But UBS said the outflows took place at a slower pace compared to previous quarters and turned positive in June.
UBS’s global wealth management reported net new money of $16 billion, its highest for the second quarter in over a decade.
ADVERTISEMENT
The shotgun marriage to its fallen rival at the behest of Swiss authorities – the first-ever merger of two global systemically important banks – has created both opportunities and risks for UBS.
On one hand, analysts note that UBS acquired Credit Suisse for a song – just 3 billion Swiss francs – while gaining a large asset base, good client relationships and talented employees.
Indeed, UBS shares have gained some 30% since the takeover was announced and are hovering around their highest levels in 15 years.
At the same time, analysts warn that the complexity and the hasty nature of the deal brings significant execution risks as UBS must aggressively cut jobs, shrink Credit Suisse’s investment banking operations and manage outflows as clients seek to spread risk.
UBS booked net profit of $29 billion for the second quarter. Groupwide UBS results include just one month of Credit Suisse earnings as the deal only closed in June.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bumper profit is due to a huge one-off gain that reflects how the acquisition costs were far below Credit Suisse’s value. It was somewhat under a consensus estimate of $33.45 billion from a poll conducted by the bank.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/ubs-absorb-credit-suisse-domestic-bank-seeks-10-billion-cost-cuts-8917363/,business

Adani family’s partners used ‘opaque’ funds to invest in its stocks : Report,"Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.","Millions of dollars were invested in some publicly traded stocks of India’s Adani Group via “opaque” Mauritius funds that “obscured” involvement of alleged business partners of the Adani family, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said in an article on Thursday.
Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.
The OCCRP article comes after U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January accused Adani Group of improper business dealings, including the use of offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius from where it said certain offshore funds “surreptitiously” owned stock in Adani’s listed firms.

Adani Group has called Hindenburg’s claims misleading and without evidence and said it always complied with laws. Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.
In a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”

“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.
Reuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.
Hindenburg saga, regulatory probe 
ADVERTISEMENT
The Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.
India’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.
Last week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.

The OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.

The media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”
“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.

If so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.
In an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/adani-familys-partners-opaque-funds-invest-stocks-media-group-8917136/,business

"Outlay on roads and renewables may climb to Rs 13 lakh crore in FY24, FY25","According to Crisil, the growth is expected to sustain over the medium term, supported by conducive policies, strong investor interest and healthy financial profiles, leading to stable credit quality of companies in the Crisil Ratings portfolio in both sectors.","The combined capital outlay on roads and renewables in the current and next fiscals is likely rise to Rs 13 lakh crore, a whopping 35 per cent growth compared with the preceding two fiscals, backed by strong execution speed.
The pace of construction of roads and capacity addition in renewables is seen increasing 25 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, over the current and next fiscals, rating firm Crisil said in a report. “This bodes well for the economy, given the high multiplier effect of road development and the critical role renewable energy can play in achieving India’s energy transition,” it said.
According to Crisil, the growth is expected to sustain over the medium term, supported by conducive policies, strong investor interest and healthy financial profiles, leading to stable credit quality of companies in the Crisil Ratings portfolio in both sectors.

Gurpreet Chhatwal, Managing Director, CRISIL Ratings, said, “The pace of execution of renewable energy projects is set to increase 33 per cent to ~20 GW per annum over current and next fiscals (15 GW per annum in the past two fiscals) supported by a healthy executable pipeline of 50 GW of projects as on March 31, 2023. Similarly, road construction is set to accelerate 25 per cent to 12,500-13,0002 km per year over the current and next fiscals on continued healthy awarding of projects and step up in execution by road construction players.”
“A supportive policy environment adds its own spurs. For instance, steps such as late payment surcharge has helped keep dues from discoms to renewable generators in check,” Crisil said. In roads, the introduction of the hybrid annuity model (HAM) has speeded up execution and drawn in investments, it said.
Further, initiatives such as Atmanirbhar Bharat, forbearance during the pandemic, and emergence of infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) have afforded a fillip to both sectors.
“Investor interest has been encouraging, with Rs 75,000-80,000 crore raised through equity and asset monetisation in the past two fiscals in both sectors,” it said.

Continued focus on asset monetisation and equity raising, along with healthy cash flows will keep the capital structure balanced in both sectors. So, despite higher capital outlays, rated renewables4 and road entities should have a healthy average debt service cushion of 1.2-1.3 times over the tenure of debt on their balance sheets, which supports their credit profiles, Crisil said.
But challenges remain such as risks of aggressive bidding and execution by new entrants. Rationalisation in bidding strategies will be crucial to sustain profitability and maintaining quality, Crisil said.
In the milieu, timely asset monetisation will remain important in the roads sector as InvITs continue to grow. For renewables, if geopolitical developments affect supply chains, it may impact the internal rate of return and pose a risk to our estimates, it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/outlay-on-roads-and-renewables-may-climb-to-rs-13-lakh-crore-in-fy24-fy25-8915300/,business

4 benefits of availing a pre-approved personal loan,"A pre-approved personal loan offers swift disbursal, flexible repayment tenures, and substantial loan amounts, making it an excellent option when you need quick funds.","Obtaining a loan can often be a time-consuming process, involving meticulous paperwork and prolonged waiting periods. This may not be feasible when you are pressed for funds in emergency situations. In these cases, a pre-approved personal loan can be a great option since it circumvents the whole approval process and speeds up the disbursal. 
A pre-approved personal loan is usually a short-term, unsecured instant loan offered by various lenders including NBFCs and banks. Pre-approved loan offers are customised for borrowers according to their creditworthiness. Lenders evaluate the borrower’s creditworthiness and generate personalised offers, granting them rapid loan processing and quicker access to funds.
For instance, lenders such as Bajaj Finance provide pre-approved offers for their Insta Personal Loans, ensuring that you receive the funds in as little as 30 minutes to 4 hours.
ADVERTISEMENT
Here are four key benefits of availing a pre-approved personal loan: 
1. Faster processing
Unlike traditional loan applications that can take days or even weeks to be reviewed, pre-approved loans are designed to accelerate the borrowing process. The borrower’s financial profile is assessed beforehand, allowing lenders to pre-approve individuals who meet certain criteria. This reduces the processing time, providing borrowers with quicker access to much-needed funds.
2. Instant funding
Pre-approved personal loans are structured to provide borrowers with swift access to the approved loan amount. Once the borrower accepts the offer, the funds are disbursed promptly, often within a matter of hours. This feature is a game-changer for situations that demand immediate financial attention. Whether it is settling a hospital bill, covering tuition fees, or managing home repairs, having funds available at your disposal can make a world of difference.
3. Minimal to no documentation required
Gathering and submitting documents for a regular personal loan can be time-consuming and cumbersome. However, with pre-approved personal loans, this burden is significantly reduced. Since the borrower’s creditworthiness has already been evaluated during the pre-approval process, lenders may require minimal or no additional documentation. This streamlined documentation requirement not only saves time but also simplifies the loan application process. Select customers can get our Insta Personal Loan without submitting any documents, such as their income proof or bank statements.
4. Flexible tenures
ADVERTISEMENT
Lenders often provide borrowers with the option to choose a repayment tenure that aligns with their financial capabilities and preferences. This flexibility allows borrowers to tailor the loan to their unique circumstances, ensuring that the repayment schedule is manageable and convenient. Whether you prefer a shorter tenure to clear the debt quickly or a longer one to keep monthly payments lower, pre-approved personal loans cater to diverse needs. 
Bajaj Finance offers Insta Personal Loans as the ideal solution for all your urgent expenses. Existing customers can obtain a pre-approved loan offer of up to Rs. 12,76,500, while new customers can get their pre-assigned loan limit instantly with just their phone number and OTP. Furthermore, Insta Personal Loans provide flexible loan tenures ranging from 6 to 63 months. You have the option of selecting the repayment term that best matches your needs.

5 things to know before availing an education loan,Education loans also offer attractive tax benefits — borrowers can avail of tax deductions on the interest component of their loan under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act.,"Due to the rising costs of education, more and more parents are turning to education loans to fund their children’s academic dreams. Among parents, the term ‘education loan’ is frequently heard, and it is one of the few ways to cover a wide range of education-related costs.
However, it is essential to know the drill before applying for one. Here are the five things you should know before you apply for an education loan:
Check your eligibility for the loan
Before applying for an education loan, check whether you are eligible for the process. It’s easy to apply for an education loan if you are an Indian citizen who has secured admission to a higher education course from a recognised institution in India or abroad. To secure an education loan, the bank will ask you to submit an admission letter as proof of your confirmed admission to the said institute/college.
ADVERTISEMENT
When applying for an education loan, lenders may require a co-applicant such as a parent or sibling. They may also ask for proof of income to ensure the borrower’s ability to repay. It’s important to note that eligibility requirements can differ among banks, so it’s best to confirm with the chosen lender before finalizing the loan.
Check for expenses covered by the loan
Education loans help cover expenses related to academics. It includes tuition fees, examination expenses, laboratory fees, travel expenses, and study materials, such as books, equipment, stationery, uniforms, etc. Some lenders also cover the borrower’s insurance premiums as part of the loan.
When choosing a loan, borrowers should not only be aware of the expenses covered but also those that are not covered. It is important to understand the terms and conditions of the loan, which can vary from lender to lender. Some lenders may limit the percentage of expenses covered by the loan amount, such as in the case of student loans where expenses should not exceed 20 percent of the total loan value. Being informed of all aspects of the loan can help borrowers be financially prepared.
Collateral and guarantor requirements
When students apply for education loans, lenders may ask for a co-applicant or guarantor. In some cases, lenders may also require collateral or a third-party guarantor to minimize their risk if the loan amount exceeds a certain limit. Education loans can be secured using collateral such as property, securities, or deposits. As a borrower, it is important to carefully review the loan terms and collateral requirements set by your lender.
Interest rates
ADVERTISEMENT
When you apply for a student loan, the interest rate is a crucial factor to consider since it affects your monthly EMI. It’s essential to compare interest rates from different lenders before taking out a loan. Typically, education loan interest rates can vary between 8 to 14 percent, depending on the lender, the course, and the institute you choose.
For instance, some lenders may offer lower interest rates to students who enroll in top institutes like IITs and IIMs. Additionally, concessional interest rates may be available to women applicants, those from reserved categories, and borrowers who start their loan repayments during the moratorium period.
(Disclaimer: Data compiled by BankBazaar.com as of Aug 25, 2023. The latest interest rates on education loans for all listed (BSE) public and private banks were considered for data compilation. Banks for which data is not available on their website were not considered. The top 10 Banks with the lowest interest rates are listed in ascending order on the basis of interest rate i.e. bank offering the lowest interest rate on an education loan (irrespective of loan amount and tenure) is placed at the top and highest at the bottom.)
Loan Moratorium
ADVERTISEMENT
A moratorium period is a period of time granted by a lender during which borrowers are not required to make loan repayments. For education loans, this grace period usually lasts for six months to one year after the course ends. The purpose of the moratorium is to give borrowers enough time to find a job before they start repaying their loans.
However, it’s important to note that interest will still accumulate during this period, so borrowers should be aware of this and plan accordingly. Loan tenure can also vary depending on the bank, with some lasting up to 15 years, including the moratorium period.
Therefore, it’s essential for borrowers to understand the terms of their moratorium period and start repaying their loan as soon as they are able to. Education loans also offer attractive tax benefits — borrowers can avail of tax deductions on the interest component of their loan under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act.
Borrowers must, however, be prudent and disciplined with their repayments to avoid future financial distress.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/5-things-to-know-before-availing-an-education-loan-india-bank-8914210/,business

"Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI","Amongst the ‘top short sellers’ are also two Indian companies – one registered in New Delhi, against whose promoter SEBI had passed an order for misleading investors and stock market manipulation. The other is registered in Mumbai.","The Enforcement Directorate has concluded, after a preliminary investigation into the Hindenburg Research report and the subsequent market crash, that a dozen companies including foreign portfolio investors and foreign institutional investors (FPIs/ FIIs) based in tax havens were the “top beneficiaries” of short selling in shares of Adani Group companies, The Indian Express has learnt.
Short sellers are investors who believe and bet share prices will fall; they borrow shares to sell and buy them back later at a lower price, thus making a profit in the transaction.
According to ED, which shared its findings with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in July, some of these short sellers allegedly took positions just 2-3 days before the Hindenburg Research report was published on January 24, and some others were taking short positions for the first time ever.
ADVERTISEMENT
Domestic investors as well as FPIs/ FIIs registered with SEBI are allowed to trade in derivatives — instruments that allow investors to hedge the market risks by taking short positions. SEBI allows regulated short selling and believes that restrictions may distort efficient price discovery, provide promoters unfettered freedom to manipulate prices and on the contrary, favour manipulators.
According to sources, three of the 12 entities are India-based (one is the Indian branch of a foreign bank); four are based in Mauritius and one each in France, Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, Ireland and London. They said none of the FPIs/ FIIs have disclosed their ownership structures to Income Tax authorities.

For instance, one was incorporated in July 2020, and had no business activity till September 2021, and in a short period of six months from September 2021 to March 2022, claimed income of Rs 1,100 crore on a turnover of Rs 31,000 crore.
Another global financial services group, which operates as a bank in India, earned just Rs 122 crore, but as an FII earned “whopping income of Rs 9,700 crore” without any income tax.

The parent company of a Cayman Islands FII, one amongst the dozen ‘top beneficiaries’ had pleaded guilty of insider trading and paid a fine of $1.8 billion in the US. In fact, this FPI took a short position in Adani Group scrips on January 20, and enhanced it further on January 23. Another Mauritius-based fund took a short position on January 10 for the first time.
Amongst the ‘top short sellers’ are also two Indian companies – one registered in New Delhi, against whose promoter SEBI had passed an order for misleading investors and stock market manipulation. The other is registered in Mumbai.

The ED had earlier presented the intelligence and analysis gathered by it on alleged insider trading to a six-member Expert Committee set up by the Supreme Court in March to investigate regulatory failure in relation to the Adani Group. In fact, in its final 173-page report, submitted to the Supreme Court on May 6, the Expert Committee had said that ED had found “potentially violative selling by specific parties” and that “this may lead to credible charges of concerted destabilisation of the Indian markets, and SEBI ought to be probing such actions under securities laws.”
ADVERTISEMENT
In its latest submission before the Supreme Court last week, SEBI had said 22 investigation reports were final, and two were interim. While one related to violations of SEBI’s minimum public shareholding norms, the other pertains to investigation of trading patterns or short positions of certain entities in Adani Group companies. SEBI sought to find if these were unusual around the time of the release of the Hindenburg report. The time period of investigation was January 18-31. The regulator had said it was actively pursuing and waiting for information from external agencies/ entities.
The conclusion of the ED, shared earlier with the Expert Committee and now with SEBI – is that transactions and income tax data throw up the possibility of the FPIs and FIIs not being the “end beneficiaries” of the gains made from short selling, but actually acting as brokers for bigger players located overseas.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/hindenburg-report-probe-short-selling-in-adani-shares-led-to-gains-for-12-firms-ed-to-sebi-8913806/,business

"India UK bilateral investment treaty likely to be finalised soon, to differ from 2016 model","Among these 74 bilateral investment treaties, notice of termination has been issued to 68 countries with request to re-negotiate based on the model BIT 2015 and six BITs are still in force. A","As India and the UK inch closer towards finalising a free trade agreement, the contours of the much-debated and contentious bilateral investment treaty are likely to be finalised around the same time as the FTA and are expected to vary significantly from the model BIT of 2016, changes for which would require approval of the Cabinet.
“We cannot be closer to the model BIT because that is from 2016 and as it is it has not found many takers. In today’s times, the demands of many countries are far removed from the BIT, so we cannot stick to the model format of the treaty,” a person aware of the matter said, adding that changes to the investment treaty will be sent to the Cabinet for approval.

"As rains dampen India’s domestic petroleum demand, uptick in exports help refiners maintain high run rates","The country is a net exporter of petroleum products thanks to its refining capacity of 250 million tonnes per annum, or around 5 million bpd, which is higher than its domestic demand.","With domestic demand for fuels and other petroleum products witnessing a slump due to the monsoon rains, India’s refined products exports has witnessed an uptick, helping the country’s refiners keep refinery runs high at a time when refining margins are robust globally, shows an analysis of data shared by commodity market analytics and intelligence firm Kpler.
The cumulative clean product exports from India in August have so far been the highest since May 2022, with jet fuel exports at a historic high. In oil industry parlance, clean products refer to the class of petroleum products that are uncontaminated and not previously used in any application. Most major crude oil-based fuels like diesel, petrol, jet fuel, kerosene, and naphtha are categorised as clean products. Dirty refined products refer to the likes of fuel oil, low sulphur waxy residue, and carbon black feedstock.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/as-rains-dampen-indias-domestic-petroleum-demand-uptick-in-exports-help-refiners-maintain-high-run-rates-8912287/,business
"Govt considering inclusion of EVs in priority sector, to help funding access","“It has to be discussed with the RBI. This will be a detailed examination. An entire review will need to be done for priority sector lending. Many sectors are demanding to get added in PSL,” a senior finance ministry official added.","The government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is considering a proposal to include electric vehicles (EVs) in the priority-sector lending (PSL) category, a senior finance ministry official said on Saturday.
“We have received a representation to include EVs in the priority sector lending. We will look at reworking the priority sector lending requirements for banks,” the official said.
“It has to be discussed with the RBI. This will be a detailed examination. An entire review will need to be done for priority sector lending. Many sectors are demanding to get added in PSL,” the official added.

Non-conventional energy sources including green hydrogen, green ammonia, and some other new renewables are likely to be considered for inclusion under priority-sector lending norms along with electric vehicles, officials said.
As per RBI guidelines, it is mandatory for banks to extend 40 per cent of their adjusted net bank credit to the priority sector. At present, seven sectors agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure, and renewable energy are considered for priority-sector lending.
Under the renewables sector as of now, bank loans up to a limit of Rs 30 crore to borrowers for purposes like solar based power generators, biomass-based power generators, wind mills, micro-hydel plants and for non-conventional energy based public utilities such as street lighting systems and remote village electrification are eligible for priority sector classification. For individual households, the loan limit is Rs 10 lakh per borrower.
Industry representatives from electric vehicles and new renewables sectors have been demanding for its inclusion under the PSL norms. About 48 projects on green hydrogen/green ammonia have been publicly announced in India as of June 2023.

In January 2022, NITI Aayog along with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in a report titled ‘Banking on Electric Vehicles in India’ had outlined the importance of priority-sector recognition for retail lending in the electric mobility ecosystem. It had given recommendations for inclusion of EVs in the RBI’s priority-sector lending guidelines stating that banks and non-banking financial companies in India have the potential to achieve an EV financing market size of Rs 40,000 crore by 2025 and Rs 3.7 lakh crore by 2030.
The report had stated that electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and commercial four-wheelers should be the early segments to prioritise under priority-sector lending stressing on the greater need for formal credit, higher potential for job creation and scale in urban and rural areas, relatively high sales forecasts, greater model availability, and smaller gap to parity in total cost of ownership.

Unicorn drought ends: Zepto raises $200 mn,"Of the $200 million raised, $105 million came from StepStone Group ($75 million) and Goodwater Capital ($30 million). The remaining $95 million came from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Groom.","By Anees Hussain
Zepto, a quick commerce startup, Friday turned a unicorn by raising $200 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion. The company’s valuation jumped from $900 million in May 2022, when it had last raised funds. The development assumes significance as it is the first unicorn to be born this calendar year and comes after a gap of 11 months. Molbio Diagnostics, in September 2022, was the last to achieve unicorn status.
Of the $200 million raised, $105 million came from StepStone Group ($75 million) and Goodwater Capital ($30 million). The remaining $95 million came from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Groom.

Zepto said that it plans to launch an initial public offering by early 2025 and aims to turn Ebitda positive in 12-15 months.
“Operating in a bear market has forced us to be more disciplined. We were previously looking at a sea-saw between profitability and growth. However, we realise that there is no question of choosing one between growth or profit, it has to be both,” Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, said.
He added that the funding validates the company’s business model and the team’s execution. “We are excited to use this capital to accelerate our growth and build the future of grocery delivery in India,” Palicha said.
The funding will be used to expand Zepto’s operations to more cities, build its dark store network and improve its technology. The company also plans to use the funds to hire more talent. Zepto competes with Zomato’s Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Tata’s BigBasket.

Sebi proposes keeping intermediaries away from ‘finfluencers’,The Sebi consultation paper comes amid a rise in the number of unregistered investment advisors giving out stock tips on social media platforms.,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Friday proposed that intermediaries should dissociate themselves from unregistered financial influencers, also known as “finfluencers”.
The Sebi consultation paper comes amid a rise in the number of unregistered investment advisors giving out stock tips on social media platforms.
“No SEBI registered intermediaries or regulated entities or their agents or representatives shall, directly or indirectly, have any association or relationship in any form, whether monetary or non-monetary, for any promotion or advertisement of their services or products, with any unregistered entities (including finfluencers),” Sebi said in the consultation paper.
ADVERTISEMENT
The paper said SEBI-registered intermediaries should take active measures to dissociate themselves from any unregistered entity using their name, product or service.
Finfluencers are usually unregistered entities providing catchy content, information, and advice on various financial topics to several followers. While some of them may be genuine educators, many of them are unauthorised investment advisers or research analysts.
The paper proposed that entities registered or regulated by Sebi, stock exchanges or the Association of Mutual Funds in India should not share confidential information of their clients with unregistered entities.
It said that registered finfluencers should display their appropriate registration number, contact details, investor grievance redressal helpline, and make appropriate disclosure and disclaimer on any posts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Besides undertaking enforcement action against unregistered finfluencers who breach SEBI regulations, the paper also proposed to disrupt the revenue model for such finfluencers, so that the perverse incentives in the ecosystem are reduced.
“SEBI registered intermediaries or regulated entities will not pay any trailing commission based on the number of referrals as referral fee,” it said.
In a separate consultation paper, released on Friday, the markets regulator proposed to create a closed ecosystem for fee collection by its registered IAs and RAs from their clients. The ecosystem will help investors ensure that their payments are reaching only registered IAs and RAs.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It will also instil confidence among investors that fees are being paid to a SEBI registered IA/ RA and will motivate them to approach only registered IAs/RAs for all their investment advisory/research service needs,” it said.
The details of the mechanism for fee collection shall be disclosed by IAs and RAs to their clients and shall form part of the client agreement, the draft paper said.
The regulator has sought public comment on both the consultation papers by September 15, 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-proposes-intermediaries-stay-away-from-finfluencers-8909724/,business
"G20 trade meet ends: Value chains to MSMEs, G20 ministers set out priority areas","All G20 member nations “unanimously agreed” on the outcome document, except for a disagreement over one paragraph on “geopolitical issues” pertaining to the Russia-Ukraine war, as taken from the G20 Bali Leaders’ Declaration in November last year.","Ending without a joint communiqué, the two-day G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting endorsed an outcome document and Chair’s summary, calling for measures to promote digitalisation of trade documents, a generic mapping framework for global value chains (GVCs) and a “Jaipur Call for Action” to enhance the access of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to information.
All G20 member nations “unanimously agreed” on the outcome document, barring one paragraph on “geopolitical issues” linked to the Russia-Ukraine war, as taken from the G20 Bali Leaders’ Declaration in November last year.
Russia and China took distinct positions on the paragraph relating to geopolitical issues. Russia rejected the inclusion of geopolitical para in the Jaipur outcome document stating it does not conform to the G20 mandate. China stated that the G20 Trade Ministerial is not the right forum to discuss geopolitical issues.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The outcome that we have come up with today, agreed by the entire group of ministers, is actually one of the most significant outcomes in the G20. It’s an outcome document and Chair summary. It has several new elements which were not part of the G20 agenda before and can become the framework or guiding principle, through which we can see significant progress in international trade and growth of the world economy,” Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said.
“Only one para… which is out of a 17-page (outcome) document, is an area where we could not get consensus for obvious reasons,” he added.
The ministers recommended certain priority areas to the G20 leaders, who would meet on September 9-10 in New Delhi, to ensure that international trade and investment can effectively contribute to resilient GVCs, spur integration of MSMEs in global trade, and to advance WTO (World Trade Organisation) reforms.
The G20 member countries deliberated on five priority areas — trade for growth and prosperity, trade and resilient global value chain, integrating MSMEs in global trade, logistics for trade and World Trade Organisation (WTO) reform. G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the global GDP and 78 per cent of global trade.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the WTO reform, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to conduct discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning Dispute Settlement System accessible to all members by 2024.
The dispute settlement of the WTO has not been fully functional since the end of 2019 as the US has not agreed to the appointment of members to the appellate body because of which many cases are pending.
“We will continue to work constructively to ensure positive outcomes including WTO reform at the WTO’s 13th Ministerial Conference (MC),” the outcome document said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The members noted the importance of taking necessary steps towards increasing the availability of trade and market-related information to MSMEs in an accessible manner, the document said, adding that there is a need to scale up the existing portal that is already providing such business and trade-related information to MSMEs.
At present, there are several domestic, regional and international portals, such as the Global Trade Helpdesk, Trade4MSMEs and government-sponsored platforms that seek to provide trade-related information to MSMEs
Regarding sharing of data for the sector, it said the member countries need to provide Global Trade Helpdesk with appropriate aggregated trade-related information relevant to MSMEs available on a single portal and provide access to data or information publicly available on such portals through appropriate technological frameworks.
It suggested the G20 leaders recommend ITC (International Trade Centre) work on a detailed implementation plan, in consultation with UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) and the WTO; and incorporate the principles of technological neutrality, data privacy, data security and reliability while upgrading the Global Trade Helpdesk.
On digitalisation of trade documents, the outcome document said that traditional trade documentation processes are often mired in paperwork, leading to substantial costs in time and labour and due to that the G20 Trade and Investment Minister has identified a set of high-level principles for the digitalisation of the documents.
ADVERTISEMENT
“In the current global trade environment, the reliance on paper-based documentation processes is prevalent across most jurisdictions. While such practices have traditionally served the needs of the sector, they are now recognised as time-consuming, labour-intensive and prone to errors,” it said.
Digitalisation can reduce these costs significantly as the delay in consignments’ clearance due to manual paperwork leads to further increased costs of logistics besides causing suboptimal utilisation of logistics capabilities.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said the digitalisation initiatives for trade documents should remain unbiased towards any specific technology, software or system and the initiatives should ensure the immutability and interoperability of data for seamless communication and exchange across diverse systems.
On strengthening GVCs, the document stated that as countries take steps to mitigate risks to GVCs, including regional value chains, policy actions can benefit from a well-defined, voluntary and non-binding generic mapping framework based on certain building blocks.
ADVERTISEMENT
These blocks include collecting timely high-quality sector-level data; and the use of models and indicators, which can provide key insights from such GVC data.
“G20 members can come together to address the need for keeping critical GVCs resilient and robust,” it said, adding that a few high-level principles that can guide these efforts include data-driven analysis.
The members endorsed voluntary and non-binding “G20 Generic Framework for Mapping GVCs”. “We are working towards understanding where the problems in GVCs are and what needs to be done…It takes care of data, takes care of analysis, takes care of concentration of suppliers and markets. It addresses concerns around volatility of trade volume and value. It also looks at upstream and downstream product needs or industry needs. It addresses the criticality of seamless flow of goods through the value chain, and also looks at connectivity,” Goyal said.

Fed’s Powell: Not yet clear rates are high enough to control inflation,His remarks showed the Fed wrestling with conflicting signals from an economy where inflation has by some readings slowed a lot without much cost to the economy.,"The U.S. Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates further to ensure inflation is contained Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in remarks that balanced declines in the pace of price increases over the past year with the surprising overperformance of the U.S. economy.
Powell said Fed policymakers would “proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further,” but also made clear that the central bank has not yet concluded that its benchmark interest rate is high enough to be sure that inflation returns to the 2% target.
“It is the Fed’s job to bring inflation down to our 2% goal, and we will do so,” Powell said. “We have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”

In that context, recent data has raised a new concern, he said.
“We are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected,” with consumer spending “especially robust” and the housing sector possibly rebounding, Powell said.
The economy continues to grow above trend, Powell said, and if that continues “it could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.”
His remarks showed the Fed wrestling with conflicting signals from an economy where inflation has by some readings slowed a lot without much cost to the economy — a good outcome, but one that has raised the possibility that Fed policy is not restrictive enough to complete the job.

It was difficult, he said, to know with precision the degree to which the Fed’s current 5.25% to 5.5% benchmark interest rate had cleared the “neutral” rate of interest needed to slow the economy, and therefore hard to assess just where policy stands.
Powell repeated what has become a standard Fed diagnosis of inflation progress — with a pandemic-era jump in goods inflation easing and a decline in housing inflation “in the pipeline,” but concern that continued consumer spending on a broad array of services and a tight labor market may make a return to 2% difficult.
A recent decline in measures of underlying inflation, stripped of food and energy prices, “were welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably,” Powell said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Given the size” of the broader services sector, excluding housing, “some further progress will be essential,” the Fed chief said, and it will likely require an economic slowdown to deliver it.
“Restrictive monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. Getting inflation sustainably back down to 2% is expected to require a period of below-trend economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions,” Powell said.
“Two percent is and will remain our inflation target,” Powell said. “We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/fed-powell-rates-high-control-inflation-8909544/,business

"FTA with UK closer, talks with Canada may happen soon: FM Nirmala Sitharaman","Speaking at the B20 Summit India 2023, FM Sitharaman said, ""India has showcased an accelerated pace of economic reforms in the past nine years.""","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said that the free trade agreement with the UK is closer, and would be very soon. While speaking at the B20 Summit India 2023, Sitharaman also said that talks with Canada on the same “may happen soon.”
This comes after UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch on Thursday said the trade pact talks with India are in the final stages. He also said that India and the UK are “actively” discussing business mobility under the proposed FTA, and clarified that the overall visa liberalisation issues do not come under the ambit of trade pacts.
The Union Finance Minister at the B20 Summit said, India’s first quarter has gone well, and that the nation’s GDP number for the same period would be good.

“India has showcased an accelerated pace of economic reforms in the past nine years,” she added.
“Government’s priority is to tame inflation,” Sitharaman said. Her comment came on the sidelines of rising inflation in India, led by a jump in vegetable prices.
In July, India’s retail inflation rate surged to a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent, breaching the upper limit of the 4+/- 2 per cent band of the Reserve Bank of India. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das in MPC meeting minutes released on Wednesday said that the supply side measures need to be continued to check the spiraling of food shocks into generalised economy-wide price impulses.
In the MPC minutes, he wrote, “Headline consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation is expected to harden significantly in July-August, driven by the spike in tomato and other vegetable prices, Das wrote in the minutes.”

RBI announced its bimonthly monetary policy on August 10, keeping the key interest rate — repo rate — unchanged for the third time in a row.
FM Sitharaman, while speaking at the B20 summit, said, “Elevated interest rates for considerable time can come in the way of economic recovery.”
“Financing climate is key factor for sustaining global economic recovery,” she said, and further added, “Green shoots of private capital expenditure upcycle can be felt now because of high budget capex.”

The Finance Minister added, “We need to cushion us sufficiently against any possible shocks; need to diversify supply chains quickly.”

Zepto becomes India’s first unicorn in nearly a year in new funding round,"Zepto said on Friday it has raised $200 million in fresh funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, making it the first startup in the country to cross the billion-dollar valuation mark in nearly a year.","Grocery startup Zepto said on Friday it has raised $200 million in fresh funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, making it the first startup in the country to cross the billion-dollar valuation mark in nearly a year.
Zepto said it raised the funds “in the midst of the deepest downturn in capital markets in over a decade” from U.S-based investment firms StepStone Group and Goodwater Capital. Existing backers including Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Groom also participated in the deal.
Zepto, which promises delivery of groceries in 10 minutes, was started in 2021 by two 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, and competes with SoftBank-funded Swiggy and Blinkit, which are all betting on fast deliveries in the so-called quick commerce sector. Even among them, Zepto’s CEO Aadit Palicha said the company has the quickest average delivery time of 13 minutes.

Zepto plans to use the funds to go deeper into the seven Indian metros it is currently present in, including Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, where it makes a monthly revenue of $50 million-$60 million, Palicha told Reuters.
“Operating in a bear market has forced us to be more disciplined. There is no (question of) growth or profit, it has to be both.” The company is also planning an initial public offering in 2025, he said, without giving further details.
While Zepto is still loss-making, a majority of its so-called dark stores – densely located warehouses – generate cash and the company aims to be profitable in 12-15 months, it said.
The company will consider expanding to new cities after a year, Palicha said.

The new framework will come into force with immediate effect, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.
Market infrastructure institutions (MIIs)– stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories — are required to conduct a comprehensive cyber audit at least two times in a financial year.

Also, they need to certify that adequate resources have been hired for staffing their Security Operations Center (SOC) and there is compliance by the MII with all Sebi circulars and advisories related to cyber security.
Further, MIIs, whose systems have been identified as ‘critical information infrastructure’ by National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), have been mandated to send regular updates of the vulnerabilities found in their respective “protected systems” to NCIIPC.

Anil Agarwal mulls listing Vedanta businesses separately,"""I have asked all my advisors and my people can we have all products (businesses that Vedanta operates) or some products to be independent,"" Agarwal said in a video message posted on YouTube.","Vedanta Ltd will consider separately listing all or some of its businesses, which range from metals and mining to oil & gas and potentially chipmaking, billionaire Anil Agarwal said on Friday.
“I have asked all my advisors and my people can we have all products (businesses that Vedanta operates) or some products to be independent,” Agarwal said in a video message posted on YouTube.
“If you have one share of Vedanta Ltd, you will have many shares of other companies and people will have an opportunity to invest in different areas. Some international companies want to invest in a particular area, they will get that opportunity.”

Agarwal said he will seek shareholders’ views on the proposal and the reorganisation could see better returns and dividends for investors.
The plans stand in contrast to Agarwal’s attempts in 2020 to delist Vedanta Ltd to expedite the process of simplifying its corporate structure, which failed.
Vedanta’s parent, Vedanta Resources, has been scrambling to raise funds, with credit rating agencies downgrading its outlook, citing funding risks and concerns about meeting debt obligations.
Earlier this year, Agarwal sought to trim down the group’s $7.7-billion debt by getting Hindustan Zinc, a unit of Vedanta Ltd, to buy some of the parent’s zinc assets in a $2.98 billion deal.

However, the Indian government, which owns nearly 30% stake in Hindustan Zinc, opposed the move.
Vedanta had in June also initiated a strategic review of its steel and steel raw materials businesses as the group eyed money from its units to tackle its debt burden.

“The money required in the next 7-10 years is about USD 4.5 trillion (to meet the priorities of development goals),” Kotak said at the B20 Summit India 2023.

He said in India every company contributes 2 per cent of their profit towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
“Out of the 2 per cent for CSR, 0.2 per cent could be our contribution to that global fund which every country should find a way to contribute to from businesses,” he added.
The priority areas for utilising the ‘global acceleration fund’ could be climate change, energy, biodiversity and ocean pollution.

Russia must implement Black Sea Grain deal to save millions: USTR,Meeting in Jaipur said the topic of the meeting could not be be discussed properly without acknowledging the serious and continuing impact of Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.,"Calling for Russia to “reverse its decision to suspend the Black Sea Grain Initiative, end its unjustified war of aggression, and withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine”, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai in her remarks at the G20 Trade and Investment Ministers’ Meeting in Jaipur said the topic of the meeting could not be be discussed properly without acknowledging the serious and continuing impact of Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.
The USTR also said that a fundamental rethink is required of the dispute settlement system under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). “There is a new and constructive process taking place in Geneva that is designed to find a way to reform where previous efforts have failed. This requires a fundamental rethink of the dispute settlement system, for example to ensure that we end the practice of judicial rulemaking,” she said.
She said the global food price index has been rising over the last one month after Russia suspended its participation in the Black Sea Grain deal. “One month ago, Russia suspended its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which provided a lifeline for hundreds of millions worldwide facing hunger and spiraling food costs by enabling the delivery of 20 million tons of grain to lower and middle-income countries. The global food price index has seen a steady rise over the past month. Russia’s suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative now threatens the food security of the most vulnerable populations around the world.”
“We call on Russia to reverse its decision, to resume negotiations, and to extend, expand, and fully implement the Initiative immediately for the benefit of the millions of people who depend on Ukrainian grain. Beyond this action, Russia must end its unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine,” she said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/russia-must-implement-black-sea-grain-deal-to-save-millions-ustr-8908233/,business

India and the US are also going to hold discussions on the seventh pending dispute between them at the WTO. Following the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US in June, India and the US had mutually resolved six trade disputes pending at the WTO in July. Three of the six disputes were initiated by India and the same number of disputes were also initiated by the US.
“We have mentioned that we have resolved six out of seven trade disputes. We are trying to resolve the seventh one also (a dispute related to poultry),” another official said.
On June 22, the joint statement issued by India and the US after the visit of Modi to the US had mentioned that the Indian Prime Minister had also expressed India’s interest towards being recognized as a Trade Agreements Act-designated country by the US to further enhance the integration of both economies and to further promote trade and investment between two countries.

“…we also want to be part of their (procurement) process, they also want us to be a part of our process,” the official added.

India to clock highest growth rate among top 5 global economies in foreseeable future: Finance Secretary,Finance secretary T V Somanathan said India will continue to clock the highest growth rate among the top five economies in the world in the foreseeable future and asked Indian diaspora to act as a catalyst and supplement government efforts in making India the biggest opportunity.,"Finance secretary T V Somanathan on Thursday said India will continue to clock the highest growth rate among the top five economies in the world in the foreseeable future and asked Indian diaspora to act as a catalyst and supplement government efforts in making India the biggest opportunity.
India is currently the fifth largest economy in the world. The top four are US, China, Japan and Germany.
An S&P Global report had earlier this month projected India’s economy to double to USD 6.7 trillion by 2031, from USD 3.4 trillion currently. “India is already the world’s fifth largest economy and it is the largest country by population. India’s rate of growth by any measurement is much faster than the top four. Today we can safely say that all four are likely to have lower growth rates than India in the foreseeable future.

“… in terms of the size of opportunity, India is arguably the biggest development opportunity of the future because we are large and we are growing faster than the other large economies,” Somanathan said in his address at the Indiaspora G20 forum.
The Indian economy grew at the rate of 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 and economists peg GDP growth to be in the range of 6-6.5 per cent in the current fiscal (April-March).
The top bureaucrat in the finance ministry asserted that India is the “most beautiful opportunity in the world” and the extent to which India harness this opportunity will mainly depend not on diaspora but on India’s domestic policies and domestic population.
He said there are three channels through which diaspora can influence — fund flow, trade and knowledge.

“If we do the right things, and we are doing the right things right now, then you can be a catalyst and a strong accelerator in what India can achieve,” he said, adding in India’s present stage of development knowledge transfer would be increasingly important.
India is the biggest country in terms of population and all challenges are of mega size. India is facing the challenges and we have the ability to tackle them.
“You need to be patient with India… We can have a zig-zag line to progress, but we will keep progressing,” Somanathan added.

Speaking to shareholders at the 20th annual general meeting of InterGlobe Aviation, CEO Pieter Elbers also said it aims to “welcome 100 million customers” in this financial year.
InterGlobe Aviation is the parent of IndiGo, which has more than 63 per cent domestic market share and is also focusing on internationalisation of its operations.

In response to a shareholder’s query regarding Aircraft on Ground (AOG), Elbers said a whole range of mitigating measures are being taken to address the situation, including cooperation with Turkish Airlines.
“We are dealing with some AOG situation… AOG is being dealt with a whole range of mitigating measures. These measures were announced at the end of last year and have been effective in order to make sure that we deliver our capacity guidance that we provided to the market and shareholders earlier,” the IndiGo CEO said.
He did not provide the number of planes that were on the ground.

Planes have been grounded due to engine issues.
At the end of June, IndiGo had a fleet of 316 planes, including 166 A320 neos, 87 A321 neos and two planes on wet lease.

Deadline for mandatory use of Aadhaar-based payment for MGNREGS not to be extended beyond August 31,"The deadline for implementing Aadhaar-based payment system as the only mode of payment to workers under national rural job guarantee scheme MGNREGS will not be extended beyond August 31, PTI reported quoting government sources.","The deadline for implementing Aadhaar-based payment system as the only mode of payment to workers under national rural job guarantee scheme MGNREGS will not be extended beyond August 31, government sources said.
The Union government in January this year made the use of Aadhaar-based payment system (ABPS) mandatory for paying wages to those enrolled under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
The initial deadline for the mandatory adoption of ABPS mode was February 1, which was later extended to March 31, then till June 30, and eventually till August 31.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, officials in the rural development ministry said the deadline will not be extended any further as over 90 per cent of active workers’ accounts have already been linked with Aadhaar.
According to a statement issued by the ministry in June, out of the total 14.28 crore active beneficiaries, Aadhaar number has been seeded with 13.75 crore.
A total of 12.17 crore Aadhaar numbers have been authenticated and 77.81 per cent were found eligible for ABPS at that time, as per the ministry.
In May 2023, about 88 per cent of the wage payment were made through ABPS.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ministry had also said that the data of job cards issued to beneficiaries of MGNREGS cannot be deleted on the basis of the reason that the worker is not eligible for ABPS.
According to a written reply by rural development minister Giriraj Singh in Parliament during the recently-concluded monsoon session, bank accounts of around 1.13 crore MGNREGS workers, or around eight per cent of the total active workers under the scheme, are yet to be seeded with Aadhaar.
North-eastern states are lagging behind in the process, with accounts of more than 42 per cent workers in Assam, around 23 per cent in Arunachal Pradesh, over 70 per cent in Meghalaya, and 37 per cent in Nagaland not being seeded with Aadhaar numbers.

ABPS as an alternative payment mode along with the direct account transfer mode has been in use under MNREGS since 2017.
Ministry officials said that states have been asked to organise camps and follow up with beneficiaries to achieve 100 per cent ABPS adoption.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/deadline-mandatory-use-aadhaar-based-payment-mgnregs-not-extended-aug-31-8907239/,business

Social welfare spending of 11 states to hit 10-yr high of Rs 4 lakh crore,"However, these do not include spending on education, agriculture, public health and other key sectors, which are budgeted separately, it said. “The revenue expenditure of states can be broadly divided into committed and non-committed,” Crisil said.","Spending on social welfare schemes by the top 11 Indian states — accounting for 75-80 per cent of aggregate gross state domestic product (GSDP) — is expected to reach a decadal high of over 1.7 per cent of GSDP, or Rs 4 lakh crore, according to the budget estimates (BE) of these states for fiscal 2024.
These expenditures have risen consistently in the past few years, from 1.2-1.3 per cent of GSDP on average before fiscal 2018 to 1.6 per cent in fiscal 2023, according to revised estimates. Going by the taxonomy of state government budgets, revenue expenditure for ‘social welfare’ refers primarily to disbursements which take place in the form of direct transfers, cash incentives and distribution of personal or household goods, Crisil said in a report.

Centre set to ban sugar exports for first time in 7 years: Report,"India is expected to ban mills from exporting sugar in the next season beginning October, halting shipments for the first time in seven years, as a lack of rain has cut cane yields, three government sources said.","India is expected to ban mills from exporting sugar in the next season beginning October, halting shipments for the first time in seven years, as a lack of rain has cut cane yields, three government sources said.
India’s absence from the world market would be likely to increase benchmark prices in New York and London that are already trading around multi-year highs, triggering fears of further inflation on global food markets.
“Our primary focus is to fulfil local sugar requirements and produce ethanol from surplus sugarcane,” said a government source who asked not to be named in line with official rules. “For the upcoming season, we will not have enough sugar to allocate for export quotas.”
ADVERTISEMENT
India allowed mills to export only 6.1 million tonnes of sugar during the current season to Sept. 30, after letting them sell a record 11.1 million tonnes last season.
In 2016, India imposed a 20% tax on sugar exports to curb overseas sales.
Monsoon rains in the top cane growing districts of the western state of Maharashtra and the southern state of Karnataka – which together account for more than half of India’s total sugar output – have been as much as 50% below average so far this year, weather department data showed.
Patchy rains would cut sugar output in the 2023/24 season and even reduce planting for the 2024/25 season, an industry official, who declined to be named, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Local sugar prices jumped this week to their highest level in nearly two years, prompting the government to allow mills to sell an extra 200,000 tonnes in August.
“Food inflation is a concern. The recent increase in sugar prices eliminates any possibility of exports,” said another government source.
Retail inflation in India jumped to a 15-month high of 7.44% in July and food inflation to 11.5% – its highest in over three years.
ADVERTISEMENT
India’s sugar production could fall 3.3% to 31.7 million tonnes in the 2023/24 season.
“We’ve allowed mills to export large volumes of sugar during the past two years,” said the third government source. “But we also have to ensure sufficient supplies and stable prices.”
India surprised buyers last month by imposing a ban on non-basmati white rice exports. New Delhi also imposed a 40% duty last week on exports of onions as it tries to calm food prices ahead of state elections later this year.
A Mumbai-based dealer with a global trade house said lower output in Thailand was also expected to reduce shipments and major producer Brazil would alone not be able to fill the gap.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-ban-sugar-exports-first-time-7-years-8905857/,business

Earlier in the day, Power Grid Corp raised 12.50 billion rupees via 10-year bonds, while Power Finance Corp raised 66 billion rupees through a combination of three-year and 10-year papers.
“There was demand from insurance companies and provident funds as they have been witnessing inflows,” said Ajay Manglunia, managing director and head of the investment grade group at JM Financial.

Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner of debt advisory firm Rockfort Fincap, added that absorption was easy as “supply from state-run companies, especially at the longer end, has come after a while”.
MTNL, too, raised 10.55 billion rupees via 10-year bonds at a semi-annual coupon of 7.61%. The spread between this paper and the 10-year government bond yield has shrunk to around 40 basis points (bps), down from over 50 bps during the previous issuance in July.
Easing government bond yields have also led to an improvement in investor appetite on bets that yields may not rise much from current levels, merchant bankers said.
Indian benchmark 7.26% 2033 bond yield eased to 7.19% on Wednesday, down from a more-than-four-month high of 7.26% hit last week, even though U.S. yields have jumped and stayed elevated.

Meanwhile, uncertainty over state debt supply is also pulling investors towards long-term bonds issued by state-run companies, traders added.

Core infrastructure and utility platform, which generates stable and assured cash flows, generated EBITDA of Rs 20,233 crore, accounting for 86 per cent of the total portfolio EBITDA.
“This gives a high level of stability and multi-decadal earnings predictability and visibility. The robust profits have resulted in the portfolio gaining a very strong liquidity position,” it said.
Adani group has been concentrating on improving operational performance as a comeback strategy after being hit by a damning report of a US short-seller in January this year.
The Hindenburg report released on January 24, alleged accounting fraud, stock price manipulation and improper use of tax havens, triggering a stock market rout that had erased close to USD 150 billion in the market value at its lowest point.

In the statement, the group said incubation under flagship Adani Enterprises continues to be a success story with airports, green hydrogen and other businesses seeing their profits almost double year-on-year. With EBITDA of Rs 1718 crore, these businesses contributed 7 per cent to the portfolio EBITDA.

Adani Green reported EBITDA of Rs 2,200 crore, a 67 per cent rise y-o-y. This was on the back of an increase in operational capacity by 43 per cent to 8,316 MW.
The cement business also showed a strong operating performance because of cost optimization and improving synergies. EBITDA per tonne increased to Rs 1253 from Rs 888 in June 2022 quarter and Rs 1079 in March 2023 quarter. As a result, EBITDA of the cement business grew 54 per cent y-o-y to Rs 1,935 crore.
However, Adani Enterprises Ltd’s existing business saw EBITDA fall by 12 per cent due to a correction in coal prices and volume stabilisation.
The FMCG business saw a drop of 64 per cent as a consequence of high-cost inventory, the statement said.

"Price hike on some food items transitory, elevated inflation warrants greater vigil: FinMin","“Though food inflation in July is perhaps the third highest since the new CPI series began in 2014, only 48 per cent of food items have inflation of above 6 per cent, and this includes 14 food items with inflation in double digits,” it said.","The recent price spike of certain food items is expected to be “transitory” and food inflation is expected to moderate in the coming months, but global uncertainty and domestic disruptions may keep inflationary pressures elevated for the coming months, warranting greater vigilance by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. In its monthly economic review for July, the ministry said that the government has already taken pre-emptive measures to restrain food inflation which, along with the arrival of fresh stock, is likely to subside price pressure in the market soon.

Also, enhanced imports of tur dal are expected to moderate pulses inflation, it said.

Icra estimates India’s GDP growth at 8.5% in Q1; maintains FY24 forecast at 6%,"India's economic growth will accelerate to 8.5 per cent in the April-June period of the current fiscal from the 6.1 per cent growth rate witnessed in the preceding January-March quarter, Icra Ratings said in a report on Tuesday.","India’s economic growth will accelerate to 8.5 per cent in the April-June period of the current fiscal from the 6.1 per cent growth rate witnessed in the preceding January-March quarter, Icra Ratings said in a report on Tuesday.
The rating agency attributed the faster growth to a supportive base and also a recovery in the services sector.
Though its estimate is higher than the RBI’s forecast of 8.1 per cent, Icra’s chief economist Aditi Nayar said the second half of the fiscal is likely to witness headwinds, which will prove a dampener.

Nayar said erratic rainfall, narrowing differentials with year-ago commodity prices, and possible slowdown in momentum of government capex “as we approach the Parliamentary elections will limit the growth”, and maintained her 6 per cent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 which is lower than RBI’s 6.5 per cent.
In the first quarter, unseasonal heavy rains, lagged effect of the monetary tightening and weak external demand exerted a downward pressure on GDP growth, she said.

Factors like a continued catch-up in services demand and improved investment activity, particularly a welcome front-loading in government capital expenditure, and sharply lower prices of various commodities which expanded margins in some sectors boosted growth in the June quarter, she said.
The agency projected that the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expansion in Q1 FY24 to be in double digits, based on the robust year on year growth performance of a majority of the investment-related indicators.

The aggregate capital outlay and net lending of 23 state governments (except Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya), and the government of India’s gross capital expenditure expanded by a sharp 76 per cent to Rs 1.2 lakh crore, and 59.1 per cent to Rs 2.8 lakh crore, respectively, in Q1 FY24, it added.
Capex-related external commercial borrowings for the purpose of modernisation, new projects, and local purchase and imports of capital goods jumped to USD 13.0 billion in Q1, exceeding the full-year FY23 levels of USD 9.6 billion, it said.
It estimated that the services’ gross value added growth to have risen to 9.7 per cent in Q1 FY24 from 6.9 per cent in Q4 FY23, adding that 11 of the 14 high-frequency indicators pertaining to the services sector recorded a growth during the quarter.

Banking liquidity enters deficit for first time in nearly 5 months,"Indian banking system liquidity slipped into a deficit for the first time since end-March, as the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) temporary liquidity withdrawal and tax outflows impacted banks' funding, traders said.","Indian banking system liquidity slipped into a deficit for the first time since end-March, as the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) temporary liquidity withdrawal and tax outflows impacted banks’ funding, traders said on Tuesday.
Banking system liquidity stood at a deficit of 236 billion rupees ($2.84 billion) as of Aug. 21, according to RBI data. Liquidity surplus had hit a 13-month high of 2.8 trillion rupees at the start of the month, but has been dropping since then. “Liquidity situation has definitely tightened after the ICRR (incremental cash reserve ratio) move and tax outflows, which is pushing up overnight rates as reliance on that borrowing has risen,” said V. Lakshmanan, head of treasury at Federal Bank.
Overnight rates have stayed closer to RBI’s marginal standing facility (MSF) rates since the start of this fortnight, with most banks remaining on borrowing side.

Weighted average call rate is around 6.71%, while weighted average TREPS rate is around 6.68%. Kotak Mahindra Bank expects deficit to rise to around 400 billion rupees by end of this week.
Liquidity is expected to stay in deficit and overnight rates are seen staying elevated, but market participants are ruling out any additional infusion from the RBI in form of repo auctions.
“The RBI’s intention was to push up rates without delivering an actual hike, and this is probably the desired result, so any probability of a repo infusion remains very low and overnight rates will oscillate between repo rate and MSF rate,” said VRC Reddy, treasury head of Karur Vysya Bank.
Earlier in the month, RBI told banks to hold an incremental cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 10% on the increase in deposits between May 19 and July 28, which has led to withdrawal of over one trillion rupees.

Price pressure in food items to be transitory; elevated inflation warrant greater vigil: FinMin,"Enhanced provision for capital expenditure by the government in the current fiscal is now leading to crowding in of private investment, and domestic consumption and investment demand would continue to drive growth going forward, said the ministry's Monthly Economic Review for July.","The finance ministry on Tuesday said price pressure on food items is expected to be transitory, with tomato prices seeing a decline, but the government and RBI need to step up vigil to deal with elevated inflationary pressure.
Enhanced provision for capital expenditure by the government in the current fiscal is now leading to crowding in of private investment, and domestic consumption and investment demand would continue to drive growth going forward, said the ministry’s Monthly Economic Review for July.
The consumer price index based retail inflation spiked to a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July 2023, with specific food commodities mainly driving the increase. Core inflation, however, stayed at a 39-month low of 4.9 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The government has already taken preemptive measures to restrain food inflation which, along with the arrival of fresh stock, is likely to subside price pressure in the market soon… The price pressure in food items is expected to be transitory,” the report said, adding, global uncertainty and domestic disruptions may keep inflationary pressures elevated for the coming months, warranting greater vigilance by the government and the RBI.
Though food inflation in July is perhaps the third highest since the new CPI series began in 2014, only 48 per cent of food items have inflation of above 6 per cent, and this includes 14 food items with inflation in double digits, it said.
Items like tomato, green chilli, ginger and garlic witnessed inflation of more than 50 per cent. Hence, the abnormal increase in prices of certain specific items led to high food inflation in July 2023.
“Tomato prices are likely to decline with the arrival of fresh stocks by the end of August or early September. Further, enhanced imports of tur dal are expected to moderate pulses inflation. These factors, along with the recent government efforts, can soon materialise moderation in food inflation in the coming months,” the ministry said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Going forward, while domestic consumption and investment demand are expected to continue driving growth, global and regional uncertainties and domestic disruptions may keep inflationary pressures elevated for the coming months, warranting greater vigilance by the government and the RBI, it added.
Russia’s decision to terminate the Black Sea Grain deal, along with dry conditions in major wheat-growing areas, caused the price spike in cereals. While domestic factors like white fly disease and uneven monsoon distribution exerted pressure on vegetable prices in India, it added.
During July, cereals, pulses and vegetables exhibited double-digit inflation compared to the corresponding period last year. Disruption in domestic production also aggravated the inflationary pressures. Interruption in the supply chain of tomatoes due to white fly disease in Kolar district, Karnataka and the swift arrival of monsoon in northern India caused a surge in tomato prices. Tur dal price also inflated due to deficient production in kharif season 2022-23, the ministry said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The RBI’s interest rate setting committee had earlier this month decided to keep policy rates unchanged and remained focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expected vegetable prices to correct in the coming months, but flagged the presence of uncertainties on the domestic food price outlook due to sudden weather events, possible El Nino conditions in August and beyond, and the firming up of global food prices. In this context, the MPC revised its inflation projection for current fiscal from 5.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent.
Cumulative rainfall during this year’s southwest monsoon season till August 18, 2023 has been deficient by about 6 per cent compared to long period average. As on August 18, 2023, farmers have sown 102.3 million hectares, which is similar to the corresponding period last year’s level and 1.1 per cent higher than the average of the last five years.
The monthly report from the finance ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs further said that the agricultural sector is picking up momentum with significant advancement in monsoon and kharif sowing. The procurement of wheat and rice has been progressing well, increasing the buffer stock levels of food grains to ensure food security in the country.
With regard to investment, the report said the government’s continued emphasis on capital expenditure is expected to drive growth in the coming years. The Union government in FY24 budget increased the capital outlay by 33.3 per cent, raising the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure from 12.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 22.4 per cent in 2023-24 (BE).
ADVERTISEMENT
“Enhanced provision for capital expenditure by the government is now leading to crowding in of private investment, as evident in the performance of various high-frequency indicators and industry reports which highlight the emergence of the green shoots of a private capex upcycle,” the report said.
It further said the Government has been making various attempts to raise investment by the private sector. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is providing capital expenditure-linked incentives to 14 key sectors. The PM Gati Shakti, coupled with the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), is expected to encourage private-sector participation in creating new infrastructure and help in onboarding major private sector infrastructure players.
ADVERTISEMENT
Going forward, the PLI and new-age sectors (such as green hydrogen, semiconductors, wearables and solar modules) are expected to account for nearly 17 per cent of the capex between FY13 and FY27, it said.
“The healthy balance sheet of the private sector, with increased capex by the government, is anticipated to increase the opportunities for the private sector to participate in myriad infrastructure initiatives. The capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is now above its long-run average, signalling the need for additional capacity creation as demand sustains the domestic economy,” it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/inflation-pressures-warrant-government-central-bank-vigilance-finance-ministry-economic-report-8903508/,business

"RBI nudges banks to settle UAE trades in rupee, dirham: Report","The move is part of the Reserve Bank of India's broader aim of promoting settlement in local currencies with countries with which India has a trade deficit, with the knock-on effect of boosting the rupee's global reach.","India’s central bank is nudging local banks to ask their clients to settle trade between the United Arab Emirates and India using the dirham (AED) or Indian rupee (INR) to reduce U.S.-dollar-based transactions, five sources told Reuters.
The move is part of the Reserve Bank of India’s broader aim of promoting settlement in local currencies with countries with which India has a trade deficit, with the knock-on effect of boosting the rupee’s global reach, three banking sources said.
India’s trade deficit with the UAE was $21.62 billion in 2022/23, or 8.2% of its total deficit, government data shows. In July, the two countries agreed to facilitate trade in rupees instead of dollars.
ADVERTISEMENT
The idea, a government source said, was to reduce the outflow of dollars on account of this trade deficit.
“The RBI has asked banks to encourage clients and corporates to initiate INR-AED trades gradually, instead of using the dollar,” said a treasury official at a private bank.
An RBI official communicated this message verbally to foreign exchange dealers at a seminar this month, four sources said. This communication has not been previously reported.
None of the sources wished to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI and trade ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
ADVERTISEMENT
The RBI may consider setting internal targets for the quantum of India-UAE trade it would like to see moved away from dollars, said the government source.
The central bank is “keen that volumes of such trades go up” and “has assured the market that they will be ready to support banks with INR-AED trades,” this banker said.
While data on such cross-currency trade volumes is not publicly available, at least three bankers said the current volume is low and may act as a hurdle for corporates to pay for the entire import in dirhams.

Indeed, earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp paid Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) in rupees to buy a million barrels of oil.
“The RBI is telling banks to first encourage large clients and corporates to start INR-AED trades because their balance sheets are relatively stronger,” another banker said.
But large corporates have, so far, been reluctant in engaging in non-dollar-denominated deals, said a banker with a state-run firm.
With smaller companies, on the other hand, bankers have pushed for such transactions by offering discounted service charges as an incentive, the banker said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/reserve-bank-nudges-banks-settle-uae-trades-rupee-dirham-8902476/,business

The US dollar declined after the Chinese central bank reduced a key rate by 10 basis points to 3.45 per cent to stimulate the economy leading to risk on sentiments.
“We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on rising global crude oil prices and overall strength in the US dollar amid the hawkish US Federal Reserve. However, positive domestic markets and any intervention by the Reserve Bank of India may support rupee at lower levels. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 82.80 to Rs 83.50,” Choudhary added.

India’s foreign trade crosses $800 billion mark in first six months of 2023: GTRI,"According to a GTRI analysis, exports of goods and services rose by 1.5 per cent to $385.4 billion during January-June this year, as against $379.5 billion in January-June 2022.","A healthy growth in India’s services segments has helped the country’s total exports and imports of goods and services to cross the USD 800 billion mark during the first half of 2023, despite a slowdown in global demand, think tank GTRI said in a report on Monday.
According to the analysis of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), exports of goods and services rose by 1.5 per cent to USD 385.4 billion during January-June this year, as against USD 379.5 billion in January-June 2022.
Imports, however, dipped by 5.9 per cent to USD 415.5 billion during the six months of this year, as against USD 441.7 billion in January-June 2022.

“India’s foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise and services) reached USD 800.9 billion during January-June 2023, exhibiting a decline of 2.5 per cent over the same period last year (January-June 2022),” the report said.
Standalone, goods exports dipped by 8.1 per cent to USD 218.7 billion, while imports contracted by 8.3 per cent to USD 325.7 billion.
On the other hand, services exports during the six months period grew by 17.7 per cent to USD 166.7 billion, while imports rose by 3.7 per cent to USD 89.8 billion.
“Data is showing modest decline due to weak global demand and losing competitiveness in labour intensive sectors. The decline in merchandise exports happened despite appreciating INR (Indian Rupee). INR/USD exchange rate appreciated from 76.16 in April 2022 to 82.18 in Apr 2023,” GTRI Co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.

He said the world trade outlook for 2023 is weak due to a number of factors, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, high inflation, tighter monetary policy, and financial uncertainty.
“But these factors will soon be overshadowed by a spate of new subsidies and protectionist measures by the EU and USA. For example, in the first seven months of 2023 alone, the EU has introduced five regulations on climate change and trade, each of these are essentially measures to curb imports,” he said.
India should continue to focus on increasing product quality and supply chain competitiveness, he said, adding since every big country is into inward mode, India should not surrender its policy space especially in new issues in FTAs (free trade agreements) and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).

He suggested the government be ready to use targeted and precise retaliation to counter unilateral policy decisions like CBAM (carbon border adjustment mechanism) or EU Deforestation Regulation.
India has done this effectively in 2019 by raising tariffs on the US products when the US in 2018 raised tariffs on steel and aluminium, he said.
The report stated that 11 of 29 product categories contributing to 25 per cent of India’s exports registered positive export growth during January-June 2023, over the same period last year.
Those sectors include Telecom, Computer and electronics items; Machinery, boilers, Turbines; Pharmaceuticals; ceramic products.
Smartphone exports jumped to USD 7.5 billion during January-June this year from USD 2.5 billion in January-June 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, exports in 18 of 29 product categories contributing to 75 per cent of total merchandise exports declined during the period and that include cereals, vegetable, fruits, spices; fish, meat; dairy products; textiles, ; carpets, garments; footwear; and leather.
“Small firms active in labour intensive sectors face 10-15 cost disadvantages due to high cost of capital, low quality grid power, delays at the ports and higher compliance cost. PLI is not an answer to product categories where thousands of firms make the same products as it will put non recipients to disadvantage,” Srivastava said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He suggested that a horizontal scheme extending 2-3 per cent incentive to every firm in the sector will help in meeting some of the cost disability.
Further, the report said that India exports goods to 240 countries and out of that, the country’s outbound shipments declined in 134 destinations.
ADVERTISEMENT
Major countries where exports declined include the USA, UAE, China, Bangladesh, and Germany. Countries where exports grew positively include Netherland, UK, Saudi Arabia.
“India’s exports exceed USD one billion with 41 countries. India’s export promotion must focus on these countries as these countries account for 87 per cent of India’s exports. India’s exports grew positively in 12 of these countries and declined in 29 countries,” he said.
During January-June 2023, the top 15 countries with which India has the highest trade deficit include China (USD 38.1 billion), Russia (USD 29.6 billion), Saudi Arabia (USD 12.9 billion), Iraq (USD 12.5 billion) and Switzerland (USD 7.5 billion).
Talking about free trade agreements, the report said the share of FTA partners in India’s merchandise exports came down from 30.1 per cent in the first six months of 2022 to 26.8 per cent in 2023.
This includes total merchandise exports and not the preferential exports for which data is not in public domain.
About oil imports, it said that import of crude petroleum came down from 79.2 billion in January-June 2022 to 73.2 billion in January-June 2023, a decline of 7.6 per cent.
“But, Russia’s share in India’s import of petroleum crude jumped from 6.4 per cent in January-June 2022 to 31.3 per cent in January-June 2023.
“Imports increased from USD 5.1 billion to USD 22.9 billion registering a growth of 350 per cent,” Srivastava said, adding the share of imports from all other major suppliers like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE has declined substantially during this period.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-foreign-trade-crosses-800-billion-mark-first-six-months-2023-gtri-8902027/,business

"Russia shadow fleet king Gatik sinks on paper, transfers all tankers to related companies","From being a marginal supplier of crude oil to India before the war in Ukraine, Russia is now New Delhi’s largest source of crude, having displaced traditional heavyweights like Iraq and Saudi Arabia.","Gatik Ship Management, which emerged out of nowhere to become one the largest transporters of Russian crude after the war in Ukraine broke out, does not have a fleet of its own anymore. Over the past three to four months, the mysterious Mumbai-based shipper swiftly transferred oil and fuel tankers managed by it to a web of related companies in the wake of the global attention and scrutiny it attracted for moving Russian oil. These tankers, however, continue to play a central role in keeping Russian oil flowing to India and other parts of the world.
According to the latest data from the international shipping resource base Equasis, Gatik is not listed as the commercial manager of even one tanker. As reported earlier by The Indian Express, around the middle of May, Gatik was listed as the commercial manager of 38 vessels, and the number declined rapidly to 19 vessels by early June. At its peak, Gatik was the commercial manager of around 60 old crude oil and petroleum product tankers, valued at over $1.5 billion, and having been acquired in the aftermath of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It was among the top players of the so-called “shadow fleet” transporting Russian oil.

"Moody’s bullish on growth, flags sectarian tension, curbs on dissent","Rising political tension may contribute to downgrade, says agency, cites Manipur","AFFIRMING INDIA’S sovereign rating at ‘Baa3’ with a stable outlook and underlining that it expected the country’s economic growth to outpace all other G20 economies through at least the next two years, Moody’s Investors Service Friday, however, said “the curtailment of civil society and political dissent, compounded by rising sectarian tensions” supported a weaker assessment of political risk and the quality of institutions.
Listing the factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings, New York-based Moody’s said: “An escalation of political tensions and/or a further weakening of checks and balances that would undermine India’s long-term growth potential would likely contribute to a downgrade. In general, durably weaker growth than currently projected would contribute to an ongoing rise in the debt burden, which would weaken the sovereign’s fiscal strength and put downward pressure on the rating. In addition, a resurgence of financial sector stress that is unlikely to be addressed promptly and effectively would also put downward pressure on the rating.”

Bitcoin drops to new two-month low as world markets sell off,"Top cryptocurrency bitcoin hit a fresh two-month low on Friday, breaking out of its recent tight range as a wave of risk averse sentiment swept through world markets.","Top cryptocurrency bitcoin hit a fresh two-month low on Friday, breaking out of its recent tight range as a wave of risk averse sentiment swept through world markets.
On Thursday, bitcoin fell 7.2% in its biggest one-day drop since November 2022 when top exchange FTX collapsed.
It then slipped to a two-month low of $26,172 during Asian trading hours on Friday, its lowest since June 16. By 0835 GMT, it had partly recovered to $26,441, down 0.8% on the day.

Global markets have been hit by a wave of selling, with Wall Street’s main indexes closing lower on Thursday and Asian shares heading for a third week of losses over concerns about China’s economy and fears that U.S. interest rates would stay higher for longer given a resilient economy.
Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency, was steady at $1,685.20, having also dropped sharply on Thursday.
Some analysts attributed crypto’s drop to a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk’s SpaceX sold its bitcoin holdings after writing the value down by $373 million. Musk is influential among crypto enthusiasts, and bitcoin prices have previously moved in response to his tweets.
The SpaceX report was the “immediate catalyst” for bitcoin’s sell-off, said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The broader driver is that crypto assets are not immune to the deepening risk-off selling pressure seen across all asset classes,” Laidler added.
Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, attributed the bitcoin price move to low volatility and a lack of enthusiasm from retail investors.
Bitcoin had been hovering close to $30,000 in recent months, having gradually recovered this year after dropping sharply in 2022 when various crypto firms collapsed, leaving investors with large losses.

Crypto markets were boosted in June by BlackRock applying to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Some investors interpreted that move as an indication that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would approve spot bitcoin ETF applications from various asset managers, including Grayscale.
“The big concern right now is that this might be a frontrun on the outcome of Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC; optimism on that front has been keeping markets inflated above whether they might otherwise be for much of the summer,” Edwards said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/world-market/bitcoin-drops-new-two-month-low-world-markets-sell-off-8898417/,business

"Provide borrowers option to switch to fixed interest rates, RBI tells banks","RBI said that at the time of reset of interest rates, Regulated Entities (REs) should provide an option to borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their board-approved policy.","The Reserve Bank on Friday asked banks and other lenders to provide individual borrowers an option of switching over to a fixed rate at the time of reset of interest rates.
In a notification, it said in respect of EMI-based floating rate personal loans, in the wake of rising interest rates, several consumer grievances related to elongation of loan tenor and/or increase in EMI amount, without proper communication with and/or consent of borrowers have been received.
In order to address these concerns, RBI asked entities regulated by it to put in place an appropriate policy framework.

“At the time of sanction, REs shall clearly communicate to the borrowers about the possible impact of change in benchmark interest rate on the loan leading to changes in EMI and/or tenor or both. Subsequently, any increase in the EMI/ tenor or both on account of the above shall be communicated to the borrower immediately through appropriate channels,” RBI said.
It further said that at the time of reset of interest rates, Regulated Entities (REs) should provide an option to borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their board-approved policy.
The policy, RBI added should specify the number of times a borrower will be allowed to
switch during the tenor of the loan.
Borrowers should also be given a choice to opt for enhancement in EMI or elongation of tenor or for a combination of both options.

U.S. 30-year yields also hit 12-year highs on Thursday, as strong economic data raised investor expectations of higher interest rates.
“The dollar will need to take a bearish turn at some point for gold to rediscover its mojo. Just how long gold will spend trading at sub $1,900 levels will depend on how long the dollar remains bolstered by high bond yields,” Waterer added.

"RBI bars banks from levying penal interest, allows them to impose ‘reasonable’ penal charges","The banks and other lending institutions will not be allowed to levy penal interest with effect from January 1, 2024, the RBI said in its notification on 'Fair Lending Practice-Penal Charges in Loan Accounts'.","Concerned over the practice of banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) using penal interest as a revenue enhancement tool, the Reserve Bank on Friday came out with modified norms, under which lenders would be able to levy only “reasonable” penal charges in case of default in repayment of loans.
The banks and other lending institutions will not be allowed to levy penal interest with effect from January 1, 2024, the RBI said in its notification on ‘Fair Lending Practice-Penal Charges in Loan Accounts’.
“Penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as ‘penal charges’ and shall not be levied in the form of ‘penal interest’ that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances,” RBI said in a notification.
ADVERTISEMENT
It further said the quantum of penal charges “shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance” of material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan/product category.
Also, there shall be no capitalisation of penal charges — no further interest computed on such charges.
However, the instructions will not apply to credit cards, external commercial borrowings, trade credits and structured obligations which are covered under product-specific directions, the RBI said.
The RBI said that many entities regulated by it use penal rates of interest, over and above the applicable interest rates, in case of defaults/non-compliance by the borrower.

“The intent of levying penal interest/charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the contracted rate of interest,” the Central bank said.
However, supervisory reviews have indicated divergent practices amongst the entities regulated by entities with regard to levy of penal interest/charges leading to customer grievances and disputes, it said, while issuing the modified norms.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-bars-banks-levying-penal-interest-allows-reasonable-penal-charges-8897894/,business

China Evergrande files for protection in US court as part of $32 billion debt overhaul,"Embattled developer China Evergrande Group has filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court as part of its debt restructuring process, as anxiety grows over China's worsening property crisis and a weakening economy.","Embattled developer China Evergrande Group has filed for protection from creditors in a U.S. bankruptcy court as part of its debt restructuring process, as anxiety grows over China’s worsening property crisis and a weakening economy.
The company sought protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which shields non-U.S. companies that are undergoing restructurings from creditors that hope to sue them or tie up assets in the United States.
The filing is procedural in nature, but the world’s most indebted property developer with more than $300 billion in liabilities has to do it as part of a restructuring process under U.S. law, two people familiar with the matter said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The developer’s offshore debt restructuring involves a total of $31.7 billion, which include bonds, collaterals and repurchase obligations.

The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Evergrande declined to comment.
Once China’s top-selling developer, Evergrande has become the poster child of the country’s unprecedented debt crisis in the property sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the economy, after slipping into a liquidity crisis in mid-2021.
A string of Chinese property developers have defaulted on their offshore debt obligations since then, leaving unfinished homes, plunging sales and shattering investor confidence in a blow to the world’s second-largest economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
The property sector crisis has also fanned financial contagion risk, which could have a destabilising impact on an economy already weakened by tepid domestic consumption, faltering factory activity, rising unemployment and weak overseas demand.
A major Chinese asset manager missed repayment obligations on some investment products and warned of a liquidity crisis, while Country Garden, the country’s largest private developer, has become the latest to flag a stifling liquidity crunch.
All of this comes at a time when property investment, home sales and new construction have contracted for more than a year.
ADVERTISEMENT
Morgan Stanley this week followed some of the major global brokerages to cut China’s growth forecast for this year. It now sees China’s gross domestic product (GDP) growing 4.7% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 5%.
DEBT RESTRUCTURING
Evergrande announced an offshore debt restructuring plan in March, expecting it to facilitate a gradual resumption of operations and generation of cash flow. It is now gathering creditor support to complete the process.
Evergrande’s creditors will vote later this month on its restructuring proposal, with possible approval by Hong Kong and British Virgin Islands courts in the first week of September.
An affiliate of the developer, Tianji Holdings, also sought Chapter 15 protection on Thursday in Manhattan bankruptcy court.
In a filing in the Manhattan bankruptcy court, Evergrande said that it was seeking recognition of restructuring talks underway in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

The company proposed scheduling a Chapter 15 recognition hearing for Sept. 20.
In June last year, another Chinese developer, Modern Land (China) Co. Ltd, which missed payments on its offshore bonds that were due in Oct, 2021, had filed a petition for recognition under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code in New York.

NCLAT to hear IDBI’s plea against Zee Entertainment on August 31,"IDBI bank had challenged the orders of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which rejected the private lender's plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday agreed to hear the IDBI bank’s plea against Zee Entertainment to initiate insolvency proceedings and allowed the lender to file an additional affidavit in a week’s time.
A two-member NCLAT bench has directed to list the matter on August 31, 2023, for the next hearing.
“Learned Counsel for Appellant prays for and is allowed a week’s time to file the Additional Affidavit,” said the NCLAT bench, comprising Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and Member Barun Mitra.

IDBI bank had challenged the orders of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which rejected the private lender’s plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
ZEE is merging with Culver Max Entertainment (earlier known as Sony Pictures Networks India), and last week, the NCLT bench from Mumbai had given a go-ahead to the merger.
Before NCLAT, IDBI challenged the NCLT order passed on May 19, 2023, in which the tribunal had set aside its plea, seeking insolvency against media major Zee Entertainment, observing that it was barred under Section 10A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
In its order, the NCLT bench had said that ZEEL, the corporate guarantor for the loan availed by Siti Networks — the principal Borrower of IDBI Bank — has committed a default.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, the default was committed during the timeline specified under section 10A of the IBC.
Section 10A mandates that no application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) can be filed against any debtor by any financial and operational creditor for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year.
This was a special provision inserted by the government in the IBC to help the companies after the economic activities had resumed post-lockdown in phases.
ADVERTISEMENT
The NCLT said Section 10A bars absolutely and forever, the filing of any application under Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Code for defaults committed on or after March 25, 2020, up to March 25, 2021.
Siti Networks has taken a loan of Rs 150 crore for a working capital facility, and as per the agreement, it has to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
Under DSRA, a credit balance equal to two-quarters of interest on working capital was required to be maintained by Siti Networks at all times till the repayment. However, there was a default.
On March 5, 2021, IDBI Bank invoked the guarantee provided by ZEEL and called to pay Rs 61.97 crore with further interest from February 18, 2021. It claimed an amount of Rs 149.60 crore in default.
This was contested by ZEEL, contending that its guarantee provides for a limited and restricted liability on the guarantor and cannot be held liable for the entire debt in case of default by the borrower at Siti Bank.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/nclat-idbi-bank-plea-zee-entertainment-august-31-8897720/,business

India considers wheat imports from Russia at discount to calm prices: Report,"India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, reported Reuters.","India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, according to four sources.
The imports would allow New Delhi to intervene more effectively in the market to drive down wheat prices that stoked inflation to a 15-month high in July.
“The government is exploring the possibility of imports through private trade and government-to-government deals. The decision will be made cautiously,” one of the sources told Reuters, when asked about wheat imports from Russia.
ADVERTISEMENT
India has not imported wheat through diplomatic deals in years. The last time India imported a significant amount of wheat was in 2017, when private traders shipped in 5.3 million metric tons.
The government’s plan to import Russian wheat is one of the supply-side measures being considered to bring down prices of key commodities like fuel, cereals and pulse along with an extension of rural schemes to ease the impact of inflation on the poor, two of the sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Sources did not want to be named as the discussions are private and the final decision might be weeks away. India’s finance, trade and government spokespersons did not reply to emails and messages seeking comment.
Last month, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said there was no proposal to import wheat from Russia.

Although India needs only 3 million to 4 million metric tons of wheat to plug the shortfall, New Delhi might consider importing 8 million to 9 million tons of wheat from Russia to have a far bigger impact on prices, another source said.
Since the war in Ukraine last year, Russia has become India’s second biggest seller of goods mainly on account of discounted oil purchases by New Delhi.
“Russia has indicated its willingness to offer a discount on prevailing market prices. There are no restrictions on the export of food commodities from Russia,” one official said.

There is no indication Country Garden’s problems might spread beyond China, which seals off its financial system from global capital flows, economists say. But they highlight the industry’s struggle under pressure from the ruling Communist Party to reduce soaring debt that is seen as an economic threat. That has bankrupted hundreds of small developers and depressed China’s economic growth.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid to 495.03, its lowest since Nov. 29, before clawing back some of its losses to trade 0.49% lower at 500.43. The index down about 8% for August and set for its worst monthly performance since September.
The dark mood is set to continue in Europe with Eurostoxx 50 futures down 0.51%, German DAX futures down 0.55% and FTSE futures 0.35% lower.

The pan-European STOXX 600 hit a fresh one-month low on Thursday, weighed down by luxury companies that are exposed to Chinese consumer demand.
China stocks have been in the doldrums in the past few weeks as a series of economic data has laid bare the stuttering post-pandemic recovery, with investors so far unimpressed with moves from policymakers and clamouring for more stimulus.
On Thursday, China’s blue-chip CSI 300 Index was flat, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was 0.12% lower after hitting a near nine-month low earlier in the session.
“I still think that there will be more action coming from policymakers,” Herald van der Linde, chief Asia equity strategist at HSBC, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “It just takes a bit of time.”

Van der Linde said the appetite to invest in China is very low. “And that appetite has to do with confidence, and that won’t change too quickly. It would be good if we would get some stimulus for consumers.”
Adding to the worrying landscape for the world’s second biggest economy is the deepening property sector crisis. Zhongzhi Enterprise Group on Thursday told investors it is facing a liquidity crisis and will conduct a debt restructuring, according to video footage of a meeting.
The move comes after Zhongrong International Trust Co, a leading trust company controlled by Zhongzhi, missed payments on dozens of investment products since the end of July, according to investor sources.

Overnight, Wall Street ended lower after minutes from the Fed’s July meeting showed officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes.
“Some participants” cited the risks to the economy of pushing rates too far even as “most” policymakers continued to prioritise the battle against inflation, the minutes showed.
The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points at the July meeting after standing pat in June.
The commentary from officials, including the hawks suggest a willingness to pause again in September, but to leave the door ajar for a further hike at either November of December meetings, ING economists said in a note.
“We think the Fed will indeed leave interest rates unchanged in September, but we don’t think it will carry through with that final forecast hike,” they said, pointing out that further rate hikes could heighten the chances of recession.

Markets are pricing in an 86% chance of the Fed standing pat next month, CME FedWatch tool showed, with a 36% chance of it hiking in its November meeting.
Data showed U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid a shortage of previously owned houses in another sign of a resilient economy that has led economists to temper forecasts of a recession.

Fed staff, who present their own independently developed views of the economy to policymakers, dropped their projection for a recession later this year.
The cloudy outlook for interest rates helped lift Treasury yields. Benchmark 10-year yields reached 4.298% in Asian hours, the highest since Oct. 21, with a 16-year peak of 4.338% in sight.

Burger King says tomatoes on ‘vacation’ as India battles food inflation,"""Even tomatoes need a vacation ... we are unable to add tomatoes to our food,"" read notices pasted at two Burger King India outlets. The chain has cited quality issues in explaining the shortfall.","Burger King has scrapped tomatoes from its wraps and burgers in many Indian outlets after prices more than quadrupled, the latest symptom of surging food inflation that is hitting consumers hard across world’s most populous nation.
“Even tomatoes need a vacation … we are unable to add tomatoes to our food,” read notices pasted at two Burger King India outlets. The chain has cited quality issues in explaining the shortfall.
The burger chain, one of India’s biggest with nearly 400 outlets, joins many McDonald’s and Subway stores that have removed tomatoes from menus as India’s food inflation this week hit its highest since January 2020.
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. sandwich chain even cancelled the free cheese slices it offered for years.
Rival Domino’s, meanwhile, has tried bringing down prices to appeal to struggling consumers with a $0.60 pizza – its cheapest in the world.
The tomato supply crisis has coincided with a surge in prices by as much as 450% to record highs as monsoon rains disrupted crop and supply chains – although they have since eased.
“Why are there no tomatoes in my burgers?” reads a question on the support page of Burger King India’s web site. The answer states its Indian franchisee follows “very high standards of quality” and tomatoes will be back soon.
“We request your patience and understanding,” it says.
ADVERTISEMENT
Restaurant Brands Asia, which operates Burger King in India, did not respond to requests for comment.
The pain is spreading with July retail inflation data released this week showing prices of vegetables rose 37% over a year. The cost of staples from onions and peas to garlic and ginger have all risen.
“If the prices remain high, then eventually restaurants will have to take price increases,” said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at India’s Prabhudas Lilladher. “There is no other alternative.”
ADVERTISEMENT
As well as placing pressure on the margins of foreign chains operating in India’s nearly $5 billion market for fast-food restaurants, the price shocks pose a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government ahead of a national election next year.
To manage the supply crisis, India has started tomato imports from Nepal, and has organised vans to distribute the staple at cheaper rates across the nation, with social media posts showing huge queues.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/burger-king-tomatoes-vacation-india-battles-food-inflation-8895149/,business

This is the second month in a row that fuel sales have fallen. The four months of monsoon generally see muted consumption.
Consumption of diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country accounting for about two-fifths of the demand, fell 5.7 per cent to 2.67 million tonnes from August 1 to 15, compared to the year-ago period.

Consumption had fallen by a steep 15 per cent in the first half of July but picked up in the second fortnight.
Month-on-month sales fell 9.5 per cent, when compared with 2.95 million tonnes of diesel consumed in the first half of July.
Diesel sales typically fall in monsoon months as rains lower demand in the agriculture sector which uses the fuel for irrigation, harvesting and transportation. Also, rains slow vehicular movements.
Consumption of diesel had soared 6.7 per cent and 9.3 per cent in April and May, respectively as agriculture demand picked up and cars yanked up air-conditioning to beat the summer heat. It started to taper in the second half of June after the monsoon set in.

Consumption had dropped 10.5 per cent in the first fortnight of July but picked up in the latter half. Sales were down 5.2 per cent month-on-month, the data showed.
India’s economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience and is likely to have surpassed the performance of most major economies during the first half of 2023.

Hyundai inks asset purchase agreement to acquire General Motors’ Talegaon plant,Hyundai Motor India signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire and assign identified assets related to General Motors India's Talegaon plant in Maharashtra.,"Hyundai Motor India on Wednesday said it has signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire and assign identified assets related to General Motors India’s Talegaon plant in Maharashtra.
The company, which had in March this year inked a term sheet to potentially acquire land, buildings and certain manufacturing equipment at General Motors India’s (GMI) Talegaon manufacturing plant, said it plans to commence manufacturing operations at the unit in 2025.
“As we reinforce our commitment to ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, we intend to create an advanced manufacturing center for Made-in-India cars in Talegaon, Maharashtra. Our manufacturing operations are scheduled to begin in Talegaon, Maharashtra, in 2025,” Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) Managing Director and CEO Unsoo Kim said in a statement.

Earlier this year, he said HMIL had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to invest Rs 20,000 crore in Tamil Nadu for expanding capacity and establishing an electric vehicle ecosystem.
With the Sriperumbudur (Chennai) and Talegaon plants, the company aims to cumulatively achieve a production capacity of 10 lakh units a year, the statement said.
GMI’s Talegaon plant currently has an annual production capacity of 1.3 lakh units.
“Upon completion of the agreement, HMIL plans to expand the annual production capacity to achieve its strategic goal in the market.

“Since HMIL already has enhanced its production capacity from 7.5 lakh units to 8.2 lakh units in the first half of this year, the capacity augmentation of the GMI plant will lay the foundation for HMIL to produce around 1 million units a year,” the company said.
HMIL further said it will review plans to launch additional electric vehicle models into the Indian market, manufactured at its Sriperumbudur plant.
The completion of the acquisition and assignment of the Talegaon plant is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions precedent and receipt of regulatory approvals from relevant government authorities and relevant stakeholders, it added.

The company said it intends to make phased investments for the purpose of upgrading the existing infrastructure and manufacturing equipment at the Talegaon plant.
These investments are aimed at bringing the plant up to Hyundai global operating and manufacturing standards, ensuring the production of automobiles that exemplify manufacturing excellence,” it said.
After more than two decades of operations in India, General Motors stopped selling cars in the country from 2017-end, as part of its global restructuring actions.
General Motors had earlier inked a pact to sell the plant to Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors. However, the agreement fell through last year as the Chinese carmaker called off plans to enter the Indian market.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/hyundai-acquire-general-motors-talegaon-plant-8895018/,business

About 5 tonne tomatoes imported from Nepal in transit; to be sold in UP tomorrow at subsidised rate: NCCF,"In Uttar Pradesh, both imported and locally-procured tomatoes are being sold through static outlets as well as mobile vans at select locations.","Cooperative NCCF on Wednesday said about 5 tonne tomatoes imported from neighbouring country Nepal are in transit and will be retailed at a subsidised rate of Rs 50/kilogram in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.
The National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India Ltd (NCCF) has contracted for import of 10 tonne of tomatoes from Nepal.
NCCF is undertaking imports as well as domestic procurement of tomatoes on behalf of the central government and retailing them at a subsidised rate to give relief to consumers from high prices of the kitchen staple.

The retail intervention is being undertaken on direction from the Union consumer affairs ministry.
Speaking to PTI, NCCF Managing Director Anice Joseph Chandra said, “We have contracted 10 tonne of tomato imports from Nepal. Out of this, 3-4 tonne was distributed yesterday in Uttar Pradesh. About 5 tonne…is in transit and will be retailed tomorrow in UP at subsidised rates.” The imported tomatoes cannot be sold in other parts of India because of the short shelf life, she said.
In Uttar Pradesh, both imported and locally-procured tomatoes are being sold through static outlets as well as mobile vans at select locations.
In Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan, tomatoes procured from key producing states in the country are being sold at a subsidised rate of Rs 50 per kg, she added.

Asked about further import of tomatoes from Nepal, Joseph Chandra said, “The imports will be undertaken from Nepal in a calibrated manner as domestic arrivals have started hitting to mandis in some states.” Arrival of the new tomato crop in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh has started in wholesale mandis and prices are also cooling down, she said.
As per the government data, all-India average wholesale price of tomatoes came down to Rs 88.22 per kg on August 15, when compared with Rs 97.56 per kg a month ago.

Russian central bank jacks up rates to 12% to support battered rouble,"The extraordinary rate meeting came after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the dollar on Monday, dragged down by the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's balance of trade and as military spending soars.","Russia’s central bank hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12% on Tuesday, an emergency move to try and halt the rouble’s recent slide after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy.
The extraordinary rate meeting came after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the dollar on Monday, dragged down by the impact of Western sanctions on Russia’s balance of trade and as military spending soars. The rouble pared gains after the decision to stand 0.3% weaker at 98.00 by 0948 GMT, but still significantly above lows near 102 on Monday which had not been hit since the early weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.
President Vladimir Putin’s economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin on Monday rebuked the central bank, blaming what he called its soft monetary policy for weakening the rouble. Hours after Oreshkin’s words, the bank announced the emergency meeting, throwing the currency a lifeline.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Inflationary pressure is building up,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. “The decision is aimed at limiting price stability risks. The pass-through of the rouble’s depreciation to prices is gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise.”
Though stopping the rot, analysts largely agreed that the move would not have a long-lasting impact. “As long as the war continues it just gets worse for Russia, the Russian economy and the rouble,” said Timothy Ash, senior EM sovereign strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.
“Hiking policy rates won’t solve anything – they might temporarily slow the pace of depreciation of the rouble at the price of slower real GDP growth – unless the core problem, the war and sanctions are resolved.”
Promsvyazbank analysts said an additional hike may be required if the rouble does not stabilise and that measures to reduce the rouble liquidity surplus were also needed.
Economics or politics?
Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has won plaudits for her handling of the economy since Russia began what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine, but the plunging rouble and high inflation have put her on the back foot, especially among pro-war nationalists.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Kremlin’s public criticism of her monetary policy adds further pressure as Russia heads towards a presidential election in March 2024, with consumers battling rising prices for basic goods.
“While such a depreciation risks boosting inflation, it is also the signal it sends out to the Russian public about the costs of the invasion of Ukraine,” said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London. “As such, today’s decision will likely have had an element of politics behind it as well as economics.”
Inflation Pressure
The bank last made an emergency rate hike in late February 2022 with a rate raise to 20% in the immediate fallout of Russia’s despatching troops to Ukraine. The bank then steadily lowered the cost of borrowing to 7.5% as strong inflation pressure eased in the second half of 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since its last cut in September 2022, the bank had held rates but steadily increased its hawkish rhetoric, eventually hiking by 100 basis points to 8.5% at its last scheduled meeting in July. The next rate decision is due on Sept. 15. Russia saw double-digit inflation in 2022 and after a deceleration in the spring of 2023 due to that high base effect, annual inflation is now above the central bank’s 4% target once more and quickening.
In annualised terms on a seasonally adjusted basis, current price growth over the last three months amounted to 7.6% on average, the bank said.
‘Slow the bleeding’
Russia’s widening budget deficit and stark labour shortage have contributed to rising inflationary pressure this year, but the rouble’s rapid slide from around 70 against the dollar at the start of the year to more than 100 on Monday has pushed the central bank to act. The bank, which blames the rouble’s slide on Russia’s shrinking current account surplus – down 85% year-on-year in January-July – has already tried to limit the rouble’s decline.
Last week, it halted the finance ministry’s FX purchases to try to reduce volatility, a step that effectively saw Russia abandon its budget rule. Analysts widely agreed that those measures alone were too minimal in scope to significantly support the currency.
“Today’s rate hike will only temporarily slow the bleeding,” said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. “Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,” he said. “And there’s little ammunition for FX intervention – the central bank has some unfrozen renminbi assets and gold reserves, but the bar for using these is likely to be high.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/russian-central-bank-jacks-up-rates-to-12-per-cent-to-support-battered-rouble-8893777/,business

Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal on Monday said such FTAs are being considered keeping in mind the future requirement for critical minerals for its energy transition, which would require batteries, and for strategic consideration.
India is looking at commencing negotiations for an FTA with Peru and Chile both of which have expressed interest in such trade pacts. “.Some of the smaller countries (are being considered) from the point of view of securing critical minerals.

India’s merchandise exports drop to 9-month low of $32.25 bn in July,This led to a narrowing of the trade deficit to $20.67 billion against $25.43 billion in July 2022.,"India’s merchandise exports declined for the sixth consecutive month to a nine-month low of $32.25 billion in July, marking a decline of 15.9 per cent year-on-year amid weak external demand, especially slowing consumption demand in some developed economies, data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Monday showed. The decline came amid a steeper fall in imports, which fell 17 per cent year-on-year to $52.92 billion.
This led to a narrowing of the trade deficit to $20.67 billion against $25.43 billion in July 2022. Officials said a major part of the decline in exports has been on account of a decline in global crude prices due to which petroleum products exports recorded a decline in value terms and not in volume terms.

India’s Vodafone Idea reports wider Q1 loss on weak 4G subscriber growth,"Its expenses rose 4% year-on-year to 185.13 billion rupees, outpacing a 2.4% rise in revenue to 106.56 billion rupees, while net debt stood at 2.12 trillion rupees as of June 30.","India’s Vodafone Idea reported a wider first-quarter loss on Monday, dragged by weak 4G subscriber growth and higher expenses.
The company’s consolidated loss after tax stood at 78.40 billion rupees ($942.8 million) for the quarter ended June 30, compared to a loss of 72.97 billion rupees a year ago.
Formed in August 2018 as a merger between the Indian arm of UK’s Vodafone and Aditya Birla Group’s Idea Cellular, the telecom operator has posted a loss in every quarter since, as subscribers increasingly switched to rivals Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company’s average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric for telecom firms, rose to 139 rupees from 135 rupees last quarter and 128 rupees in the year-ago quarter, helped by “subscriber migration to higher ARPU plans”, it said.
Airtel’s ARPU was at 200 rupees while Jio’s ARPU was at 180.5 rupees.
Vodafone Idea’s 4G subscriber base, too, barely inched up 0.2% to 122.9 million sequentially; its overall subscriber base shrunk to 221.4 million from 225.9 million sequentially.
Its expenses rose 4% year-on-year to 185.13 billion rupees, outpacing a 2.4% rise in revenue to 106.56 billion rupees, while net debt stood at 2.12 trillion rupees as of June 30.

Burdened with massive government debt and spectrum dues, Vodafone Idea has been unable to ink a fundraising deal. In April, billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla returned to the company’s board, raising hopes that the Birla Group might infuse money.
“We remain engaged with our lenders for further debt fundraising as well as with other parties for equity or equity-linked fundraising to make required investments for network expansion, including 5G rollout,” CEO Akshaya Moondra said in a statement.
Airtel reported it beat its June-quarter revenue estimates earlier this month, while Jio reported its slowest revenue and profit growth in six quarters last month.

Russia’s ruble hits its lowest level since early in the war. The central bank plans to step in,Russia typically sells foreign currency to counter any shortfall in revenue from oil and natural gas exports and buys currency if it has a surplus.,"The Russian ruble on Monday reached its lowest value since the early weeks of the war in Ukraine as Moscow increases military spending and Western sanctions weigh on its energy exports.
It led Russia’s central bank to announce it will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to review its key interest rate, opening the possibility of an increase in borrowing costs that would support the flagging ruble.
The Russian currency passed 101 rubles to the dollar, continuing a more than 25 per cent decline in its value since the beginning of the year and hitting the lowest level in almost 17 months. The ruble recovered slightly after the central bank’s announcement.
ADVERTISEMENT
The meeting was set after President Vladimir Putin’s economic adviser, Maksim Oreshkin, blamed the weak ruble on “loose monetary policy” in an op-ed Monday for state news agency Tass. He said a strong ruble is in the interest of the Russian economy and that a weak currency “complicates economic restructuring and negatively affects people’s real incomes.” Oreshkin said Russia’s central bank has “all the tools necessary” to stabilise the situation and said he expected normalization shortly.
Bank deputy director Alexei Zabotkin told reporters Friday that it is adhering to a floating exchange rate because “it allows the economy to effectively adapt to changing external conditions.” Analysts say the weakening of the ruble is being driven by increased defence spending — leading imports to rise — and falling exports, particularly in the oil and natural gas sector.
Importing more and exporting less means a smaller trade surplus, which typically weighs on a country’s currency.
The Russian economy is now “working on different types of state orders related to the war, such as textile enterprises, pharmaceuticals and the food industry,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre and a former Russian central bank official.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pivoting the entire economy to a war footing not only drives up imports but also raises the prospect of worsening inflation, she said.
To help lessen that prospect, the central bank said last week that it would stop buying foreign currency on the domestic market until the end of the year to try to prop up the ruble and reduce volatility.
Russia typically sells foreign currency to counter any shortfall in revenue from oil and natural gas exports and buys currency if it has a surplus.
ADVERTISEMENT
The central bank also enacted a big increase of 1 per cent to its key interest rate last month, saying inflation is expected to keep rising and the fall in the ruble is adding to the risk. The next meeting to discuss Russia’s key interest rate was planned for 15 September.
On Monday, some Russians in Moscow appeared concerned about the weakening currency.
“Prices will rise, which means that the standard of living will fall. It has already fallen, and it will fall even more — there are definitely more poor people,” said Vladimir Bessosedny, 63, a retired teacher.
Others hoped the fall of the ruble was temporary and that it would stabilise.
In January, the ruble traded at about 66 to the dollar but lost about a third of its value in subsequent months.
ADVERTISEMENT
After Western countries imposed sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the ruble plunged as low as 130 to the dollar, but the central bank enacted capital controls that stabilised its value. By last summer, it was in the 50-60 range to the dollar.
Zabotkin said Friday that international sanctions had cut off a significant amount of imports to Russia, contributing to the ruble’s fall, but he dismissed speculation that capital flight from Russia also was to blame, saying the idea was “not substantiated.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/russia-ruble-hits-lowest-level-war-central-bank-8892636/,business

Since July, both NCCF and NAFED have been selling tomatoes at a discounted rate on behalf of the consumer affairs ministry in Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar to boost domestic availability and contain price rise.
Initially, the ministry had asked the two cooperatives to sell tomatoes at a subsidised rate of Rs 90 per kg and later reduced the price to Rs 80 per kg. Further, the price was cut to Rs 70 per kg.

In addition, NCCF is doing retail sale of tomatoes through the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) platform.

Boeing front-runner in wide-body jet talks with IndiGo: Report,"Boeing has emerged as the front-runner to secure an order for around 25 wide-body planes from IndiGo, industry sources told Reuters on Monday, as India's biggest airline deepens its international expansion with new destinations.","Boeing has emerged as the front-runner to secure an order for around 25 wide-body planes from IndiGo, industry sources told Reuters on Monday, as India’s biggest airline deepens its international expansion with new destinations.
IndiGo is in talks to buy Boeing’s 787 family of twin-aisle aircraft, which has been pitted against Airbus A330neo jets, said the sources who are familiar with the matter.
No decision has been finalised, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the negotiations are confidential.

IndiGo said it does not comment on speculation. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Airbus said it never comments on discussions it may or may not be having with existing and prospective customers.
Reuters first reported in March that IndiGo was in talks with Airbus and Boeing for the wide-body jets.
The recent talks come weeks after IndiGo placed a record order for 500 Airbus narrow-body jets, shadowing an earlier record deal by rival Air India for 470 Airbus and Boeing planes.
Indian carriers are trying to keep pace with the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, where demand for air travel has surged post-COVID, sending industry records tumbling even as plane manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals.
ADVERTISEMENT
The drive by IndiGo, which has 58% share of India’s domestic market, also comes at a time when it is aiming to double its capacity by the end of the decade and expand its network, especially in international markets.
IndiGo recently launched new flights to destinations in Africa, West Asia and Southeast Asia, and is also growing its presence in Europe through its codeshare partnership with seven carriers including Turkish Airlines and KLM.
So far, IndiGo has been an exclusive buyer of Airbus narrow-body jets and a deal for wide-body planes would be a departure from that strategy. Earlier this year it began international operations with a Boeing 777, its first twin aisle aircraft taken from partner Turkish Airlines, which provides the pilots.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/boeing-front-runner-wide-body-jet-talks-indigo-8892258/,business

Nykaa posts 24% jump in Q1 revenue on boost from summer sale,Nykaa's flagship 'Pink Summer Sale' helped boost its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment - the company's biggest. BPC orders increased by 17% in the quarter.,"Nykaa reported a higher first-quarter revenue on Friday, as the cosmetics-to-fashion retailer’s flagship sale event helped sustain demand amid a slowdown in discretionary spending.
The company’s revenue grew 23.8% year-on-year to 14.22 billion rupees (about $172 million) in the April-June quarter.
Nykaa’s flagship ‘Pink Summer Sale’ helped boost its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment – the company’s biggest. BPC orders increased by 17% in the quarter.

The company’s overall gross merchandise value (GMV) – the monetary value of all its orders – rose 24% to 26.68 billion rupees.
The BPC business’s GMV grew by the same margin, accounting for nearly 70% of total GMV and helping outweigh a relatively smaller 12% rise in the fashion segment’s GMV, which, Nykaa said was slower than the segment’s long-term trajectory.
Nykaa had warned last month that apparel sales were hit by lower discretionary spending, especially in smaller cities and towns.
While India’s retail inflation eased in April and May before rising slightly in June, it has remained stubbornly high enough for consumers to think twice about certain discretionary spends.

In this environment, Nykaa has also had to contend with a raft of executive resignations, including its marketing head, a move that led to founder and CEO Falguni Nayar taking direct oversight of the function.
Nykaa’s consolidated profit before tax rose 16.5% year-on-year to 97.2 million rupees. Its profit attributable to shareholders, however, fell 27.4% to 33 million rupees, while profit for non-controlling interests surged 4.6-fold.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/indias-nykaa-posts-24-jump-q1-revenue-boost-summer-sale-8888182/,business
Adani group units in talks to tap local bond market to raise Rs 15 billion: Report,"Two units of Adani group are in talks with merchant bankers to raise as much as 15 billion rupees ($181 million) each through local currency bonds as part of the ports-to-power conglomerate's aim to raise 100 billion rupees this financial year, Reuters reported.","Two units of Adani group are in talks with merchant bankers to raise as much as 15 billion rupees ($181 million) each through local currency bonds as part of the ports-to-power conglomerate’s aim to raise 100 billion rupees this financial year, a company official and three bankers said.
The plans are part of the Adani group’s tentative return to the local bond markets after a hiatus since January when U.S. short-seller Hindenberg Research raised governance concerns that led to a selloff in the group companies’ stocks. The group has denied these allegations.
Adani Airport Holdings and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone may tap the market first, with offerings of around 10-15 billion rupees, the bankers said.

They are looking to issue up-to-five-year bonds as soon as September, said one banker directly familiar with the plans.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The Adani group did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
“The (Adani) group is testing investors’ appetite for its securities and will tap the market only when there will be a comfort of demand,” said the second banker who advises the conglomerate on local borrowings.
The group’s flagship Adani Enterprises as well as Adani Electricity Mumbai are also in talks for possible debt issues, the bankers said.

However, plans will be finalised only after the markets regulator submits its report on its investigation into Hindenburg’s allegations, likely by Monday, the second banker said.
“Post that, all these fundraising plans may start getting finalised as initial talks have already started.”
Initially, group companies may have to offer a higher spread than their last issuance, said a third banker aware of the discussions but not directly part of the deal.

“Domestic institutional investors may not immediately start investing in these bonds and demand will be seen from corporates, high net-worth individuals and some banks,” the banker said.
Adani Enterprises returned to the market in July to raise 12.5 billion rupees through three-year bonds, but its interest costs rose to 10%.

"Subway India takes away free cheese slice, offers sauce as inflation bites","American chain Subway is one of largest restaurant franchisers in India, with around 800 outlets. They now charge 30 rupees ($0.40) extra for the cheese slice in most sandwiches, but are offering a free ""cheezy"" sauce instead.","Subway sandwiches in India will no longer come with the option of a free cheese slice following revisions to its menu that analysts regarded as being more about cost-cutting than just a matter of taste.
American chain Subway is one of largest restaurant franchisers in India, with around 800 outlets. They now charge 30 rupees ($0.40) extra for the cheese slice in most sandwiches, but are offering a free “cheezy” sauce instead.
Rising prices for ingredients, including dairy products, have put global fast food chains in India under pressure to trim costs while keeping customers satisfied.
ADVERTISEMENT
Domino’s promotion price for its cheapest pizza is just 60 U.S. cents in India, where its franchisee has publicly flagged concerns over a 40% surge in the price of cheese during the financial year that ended in March.
Many Subway and McDonald’s outlets in India have also removed tomatoes from their menus in recent weeks citing quality issues after prices surged around 450% to record highs.
India has resorted to importing tomatoes from Nepal to ease the shortage.
The cheese sauce now available for free at Subway India was “developed for qualitative reasons alone”, said Everstone Group’s Culinary Brands, which manages the supply chain for all 800 outlets and is the master franchisee for around 200.
ADVERTISEMENT
The qualitative change clearly isn’t to everyone’s taste.
Subway has “replaced the cheese slice with liquid cheese blend … You just lost a loyal customer,” one unimpressed customer, Sumit Arora, wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
A Subway store manager in New Delhi told Reuters the new cheese sauce costs 400 rupees/kilogram. Market prices show cheese slices typically cost around 700 rupees/kilogram.
ADVERTISEMENT
A cheese slice, said Culinary Brands’ marketing head Mayur Hola, “can be added on at a small cost”. “Ingredient costs are not something we comment on … this is simply an upgrade to make our subs better.”
Asked about the Subway move, Karan Taurani, a consumer discretionary analyst at India’s Elara Capital, said elevated cheese, grain and vegetable prices have pushed restaurants to come up with “innovative” strategies.
“It is a way of putting inflationary pressure on the customer rather than going for a blanket price hike,” he said.
A Subway sandwich costs around 200-300 rupees ($2.4 to $3.6) in India, and if a customer adds the cheese slice – which was once free – will now cost up to 15% higher.
Spokespersons for Subway didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Govt to release buffer onion in open market immediately to keep prices under check,"The government is exploring multiple options for disposal of onion: e-auction, e-commerce as well as through states at discounted rates via retail outlets of their consumer cooperatives and corporations, it said.","The government on Friday announced it will release onion from its buffer stock in the targeted regions with immediate effect to ensure prices remain under check till the new crop arrives from October onwards.
The government is exploring multiple options for disposal of onion: e-auction, e-commerce as well as through states at discounted rates via retail outlets of their consumer cooperatives and corporations, it said.
The government has currently maintained 3 lakh tonnes of onion under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) to meet any exigencies, if rates go up significantly during the lean supply season.
ADVERTISEMENT
As per the government data, onion prices have started inching up slightly as all-India retail price of the key kitchen staple was available at Rs 27.90 per kilogramme on August 10, higher by a little over Rs 2 per kg in the year-ago period.
“We will release onion from the buffer stock immediately,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh told PTI.
The modalities for the disposal of onion has been finalised after discussions with the officials of cooperative NAFED and National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India Limited (NCCF) on August 10, he said.
The ministry, in a statement, said it will release the onion stocks by targeting key markets in states or regions where retail prices are ruling above the all-India average and also where the increase in prices over previous month and year are above the threshold level.
ADVERTISEMENT
Disposal through e-auction and retail sales on e-commerce platforms are also being explored. The quantity and pace of disposal will also be calibrated with the prices and availability situations with the objective of making onion available to consumers at affordable prices, it said.
Apart from market disposal, it has also decided to offer state governments at discounted rates for sale through retail outlets of their consumer cooperatives and corporations.
In current year, a total of three lakh metric tonnes of onion has been procured for the buffer, which could be enhanced further, if situation demands, it added.
ADVERTISEMENT
NAFED and NCCF had procured 1.50 lakh tonnes each of rabi onion during June and July from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. This year, irradiation of onion had also been taken up on pilot basis in collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) with the objective of minimizing storage loss. About 1,000 tonnes had been irradiated and stored in controlled atmosphere storage.
The annual buffers have been built by procuring onions from rabi harvest for release in major consumption centres during the lean season. Onion buffer size has been tripled in past four years; from one lakh tonnes in 2020-21 to three lakh metric tonnes in 2023-24.
“The onion buffer has played a key role in ensuring availability of onion to the consumers at affordable prices and in maintaining price stability,” the ministry added.
Rabi onion harvested during April-June accounts for 65 per cent of India’s onion production and meets consumers’ demand till the kharif crop is harvested in October-November.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-release-buffer-onion-open-market-immediately-keep-prices-under-check-8887803/,business
"Disbursement under PLI scheme will be about Rs 13,000 crore this year: DPIIT secretary","Secretary in the Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that from the current year onwards, the disbursal number will be significantly larger.","The government is expected to disburse about Rs 13,000 crore to eligible firms seeking benefits under the production linked incentive (PLI) schemes, even though an exercise is going on to tweak the scheme for those sectors which have not yet picked up well, a top official said on Friday.
Secretary in the Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that from the current year onwards, the disbursal number will be significantly larger.
The disbursals “I think will go to about Rs 13,000 crore this year”, he told reporters here.

The government disbursed only Rs 2,900 crore till March 2023 out of Rs 3,400 crore claims received under the scheme so far.
The scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors such as telecommunications, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.
Asked about when the full fund would be disbursed, Singh said: “It is difficult to say as so many factors come into play. But we expect that during the tenure of the scheme, a good part (of that) will get exhausted.” Savings from the scheme, he said, are already being considered for other PLI schemes or for restructured PLI schemes.
When asked about the restructured PLI schemes, the secretary said those are under various stages of inter-ministerial consultation.

“There are some course-corrections or tweaking that are required. Some are minor, some are major and that will require higher level approvals,” he said.
PLI schemes for sectors which are not picking up well include high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries, textile products and speciality steel. On the other hand, the scheme is doing good in sectors such as electronics, pharma, medical devices, telecom, food processing, and white goods.
The government is trying to sort out issues such as timely processing of claims, visa-related matters where vendors require Chinese professionals’ expertise, and delay in getting environmental clearances that have been raised by the stakeholders of production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes.

The purpose of the schemes is to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector; and make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.
These schemes for all 14 sectors have been notified by the concerned ministries/ departments after due approval. These schemes are in various stages of implementation. Out of the 733 applications selected under 14 sectors, 176 MSMEs are among the beneficiaries.

Calling for concerted efforts to ensure the future is better for all, she said a common thread in the current G20 agenda is preparing for a better tomorrow for all and noted that during the presidency, New Delhi so far ensured that the common ground is reached on all economic issues especially in finding a solution to the debt overhang that many middle-income countries are facing today.
Another consistent effort has been to address the challenges arising from the challenges to multilaterism that multilateral lending agencies are facing today as they are increasingly facing demands from both borrowers and lending nations to expand their core operation beyond their core developmental mandate. The G20 has set up an expert group to find out some lasting solutions.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-concerted-global-efforts-restructure-debt-poor-countries-8887359/,business

"Gold stays near 1-month lows as US dollar, yields hold ground","Gold prices held near one-month lows on Friday, shrugging off cooler-than-expected US inflation figures for last month, with bullion staying on course to wrap up its worst week in seven.","Gold prices held near one-month lows on Friday, shrugging off cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation figures for last month, with bullion staying on course to wrap up its worst week in seven as the U.S. dollar and bond yields stood strong.
Spot gold edged 0.1% higher to $1,913.95 per ounce by 0347 GMT, but traded near its lowest level since July 7 touched earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures were down 0.1% at $1,946.20.
Gold gained as much as 0.8% on Thursday after data showed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, but was less than the Reuters poll forecast of 3.3%, raising bets that the U.S. central bank will unlikely hike interest rates again in 2023.
ADVERTISEMENT
Interest rate increases weigh on gold because they tend to lift bond yields and in turn raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
“Once the CPI dust had settled, markets seemed to remember that core CPI at 4.7% is still not great – even if it was slower than expected,” said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index, adding that gold’s move higher lacked conviction.
“We also had Fed member Mary Daly putting a fly in the dovish ointment, saying whether another hold or hike at the Fed’s next meeting is ‘yet to be determined’. And that saw the U.S. dollar regain its strength.”
Gold prices have slid about 1.4% so far in the week as the U.S. dollar index and benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields were both on track for their fourth consecutive weekly gain.

Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.2% to $22.72 an ounce and platinum added nearly 1% to $915.06. Still, both were on track for their fourth straight weekly loss.

Conditions favourable for private investment to pick up: RBI Governor,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said key sectors including iron and steel and automobiles, are already witnessing private investments.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said with strong balance sheets of banks and corporates, private capex is likely to gather pace. He said key sectors including iron and steel and automobiles, are already witnessing private investments.
On private capex
At the moment, there is a twin balance sheet advantage. Both bank and corporate balance sheets are strong and deleverage, so there is space for making investments. Eventually, it depends on individual companies but private investment in some key sectors is happening such as in iron and steel, automobile, petroleum, metals, chemicals. Going forward, it should happen in other sectors because the ground conditions are favourable for investments.
On UPI linkage
With regard to UPI linkage, we have already done it with Singapore. So far as the RuPay card is concerned, it is already used in a few other countries. Recently, we have signed an MoU with UAE whereby we are going to link UPI with their IPP (Instant Payment Platform) system. It is work in progress and will happen in the coming months. Discussions are underway with a few other countries also for linkage of the payment systems, including some advanced economies who have evinced interest in linking to UPI. UPI is now perhaps the most efficient and advanced payment system in the world.
On foreign exchange reserves
ADVERTISEMENT
Lower current account deficit and ample capital flows have imparted strength to our external sector. The resultant accretion to forex reserves has provided a buffer against external shocks. Foreign exchange reserves have crossed the USD 600 billion mark. The umbrella has gathered further strength; and I am not saying this in the context of the monsoon rains!
On current account deficit
India’s current account deficit (CAD) was contained at 2 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 as compared with 1.2 per cent in 2021-22. Merchandise trade deficit has narrowed in Q1 of 2023-24 with contraction in imports exceeding contraction in exports. Services exports and remittances are, however, expected to provide cushion to the current account deficit. We, therefore, expect CAD to remain eminently manageable during the current financial year also.
On impact of amount held in Vostro account
It has become a part of the system, it will be a normal situation. In any case any trade relation of India with any country is not a short-term trade relation, it’s a long term trade relation whichever is the country. Therefore, there is no reason to expect that suddenly a country decides to pull out, why should they do that? It’s a continuing trade relation. So, we don’t see any stress or any concern with regard to the quantum that would be held in Vostro accounts from various countries.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/conditions-favourable-for-private-investment-to-pick-up-rbi-governor-8886546/,business

"NCLT clears Zee-Sony deal, paves way for creation of $10-billion entertainment giant","Following the order, Zee’s share price rallied to gain 20% in intra-day trade and closed up 17.95% at `285.55 on the BSE.","Clearing the decks for the creation of the country’s largest media company, the National Company Law Tribunal on Thursday approved the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprises with Culver Max Entertainment (formerly Sony Pictures Networks India). The tribunal’s Mumbai bench also dismissed all objections against the proposed merger.
Following the order, Zee’s share price rallied to gain 20% in intra-day trade and closed up 17.95% at `285.55 on the BSE.
The ruling, pronounced as an oral order, comes a month after the tribunal reserved its verdict after hearing objections from creditors on July 11. A number of creditors, including Axis Finance, JC Flower Asset Reconstruction, IDBI Bank, Imax Corp and IDBI Trusteeship, had raised issues over the merger.
ADVERTISEMENT
This could be the final approval needed for the merger, unless some of the creditors decide to move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
In September 2021, Zee, an Essel Group company promoted by media baron Subhash Chandra, announced plans to merge the firm with Sony Pictures Networks India, a subsidiary of Japan’s Sony Corp. The companies later approached NCLT seeking approvals.
The deal, which has already received approvals from the stock exchanges, Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the Competition Commission of India, would result in creating the country’s largest media and entertainment company with standalone revenues of $2 billion.
The merger, according to analysts, would create a $10-billion media giant, with the combined entity owning over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (Zee5 and SonyLiv) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India). It would be the country’s largest TV network company with a 26% market share.

In an interim order on June 12, Sebi had prohibited Subhash Chandra, chairman of Essel Group, and his son Punit Goenka from assuming directorial or major managerial positions due to alleged misuse of funds from Zee for personal gain. The Securities Appellate Tribunal uheld Sebi’s interim order, imposing a one-year restraint on Zee promoters Chandra and Goenka from holding board positions in publicly listed companies, citing alleged fund diversion. —FE",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/nclt-approves-zee-entertainment-sony-merger-8885905/,business

Monetary policy meet: RBI asks banks to set aside incremental CRR,"Banks shall maintain an incremental CRR of 10% on increase in deposits between May 19 and July 28, with effect from the fortnight starting Aug. 12, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in his monetary policy announcement.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday asked banks to set aside a larger part of incremental deposits under cash reserve ratio (CRR) to tighten liquidity in the near term.
Banks shall maintain an incremental CRR of 10% on increase in deposits between May 19 and July 28, with effect from the fortnight starting Aug. 12, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in his monetary policy announcement.
Das however added that the measure was temporary to absorb liquidity generated by a return of high denomination notes, a move that was announced by the RBI in mid-May.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This is purely a temporary measure for managing the liquidity overhang. Even after this temporary impounding, there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy,” Das said.
Das further added that the measure will be reviewed on Sept. 8 or earlier with a view to returning the impounded funds to the banking system ahead of the festival season.
India’s banking system liquidity surplus has averaged around 2.5 trillion Indian rupees ($30.18 billion) in August, up from 1.6 trillion rupees in July.
The RBI stopped conducting lower duration variable rate reverse repos nearly a month ago, after auctions were not fully subscribed.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Banks will have to maintain excess CRR for the next two fortnights, and that would lead to an immediate removal of some portion of the current surplus,” a trader with a private bank said.
“The amount that could be withdrawn seems to be less than one trillion rupees,” the trader, who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media, added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/rbi-monetary-policy-meet-banks-to-set-aside-incremental-crr-8885535/,business
"RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank raises FY24 inflation projection, retains GDP forecast at 6.5%","Unveiling the bi-monthly monetary policy, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said domestic economic activity is maintaining resilience.","The RBI on Thursday retained the GDP growth projection for current fiscal year at 6.5 per cent and raised the inflation projection marginally to 5.4 per cent due to spike in vegetable prices, including tomatoes.
Unveiling the bi-monthly monetary policy, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said domestic economic activity is maintaining resilience.
He also said the recovery in kharif sowing and rural incomes, the buoyancy in services and consumer optimism should support household consumption.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Headwinds from weak global demand, volatility in global financial markets, geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation, however, pose risks to the outlook,” Das said.
Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; Q3 at 6.0 per cent; and Q4 at 5.7 per cent.
Real GDP growth for Q1 of 2024-25 is projected at 6.6 per cent.
On inflation, the governor said the spike in vegetable prices, led by tomatoes, would exert sizeable upside pressures on the near-term headline inflation trajectory.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This jump is, however, likely to correct with fresh market arrivals,” he said, and added there has been significant improvement in the progress of the monsoon and kharif sowing in July.
However, Das added the impact of the uneven rainfall distribution warrants careful monitoring.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, the governor said.

"Adani Enterprises weighs selling its stake in Wilmar, exiting $6 billion JV: Report","Adani Enterprises has been considering a potential sale of its 44% stake in Adani Wilmar for a few months, according to a report.","Adani Enterprises is exploring selling its stake in its consumer-staple joint venture with Wilmar International, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The conglomerate has been considering a potential sale of its 44% stake in Adani Wilmar for a few months, according to the report. The India-based fast-moving consumer goods maker is currently valued at $6.17 billion.
Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and his family may retain a minority stake in a personal capacity following a sale, while Wilmar could decide to retain its stake in the business, Bloomberg reported.

Deliberations are at an early stage and Adani Enterprises may decide to keep its stake, the report said.
Adani Enterprises and Wilmar did not respond to Reuters requests for comment, while Adani Wilmar said it would not like to comment on the report.
Last week, Adani Wilmar reported loss in the first quarter, hurt by a steep decline in edible oil prices.
Adani Group-linked stocks have lost nearly $147 billion in market value earlier this year after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research raised questions on the group’s corporate governance.

RBI’s MPC to dial up hawkishness even as it holds policy steady,A Reuters poll of 75 economists showed the Reserve Bank of India was expected to keep its repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent at its August 10 policy meeting.,"India’s monetary policy committee (MPC) is expected to maintain key rates when it meets on Thursday, but will adopt a far more hawkish tone as the recent rise in food prices risks becoming entrenched, economists and market participants said.
A July 13-31 Reuters poll of 75 economists showed the central bank was expected to keep its repo rate unchanged at 6.50% at its Aug. 10 policy meeting.
Food price spikes in India, typical at the onset of the monsoon, drove up headline inflation in June, corroborating the MPC’s view that the fight against inflation is far from over, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its bulletin last month.
ADVERTISEMENT
The rise in food prices, however, has been sharper than expected this year and is seen lasting longer.
“It’s likely that the hawkish rhetoric will be dialled up further in the MPC meeting,” Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics said.
DBS Bank expects the evolving inflationary trend to pose a 80-100 basis points (bps) upside risk to the MPC’s current inflation forecast of 5.2% for the September quarter.
June CPI rose 4.81%, snapping a four-month easing trend, with economists expecting the July print, due on Aug. 12, to top 6% levels, moving out of the RBI’s 2%-6% inflation comfort band.
ADVERTISEMENT
The MPC at its June policy meeting also reiterated its intent of nudging inflation towards its medium-term target of 4% and not just holding it below 6%.
DBS said not only are rate cut expectations getting priced out, but the OIS curve appears to be pricing for around a 40-50% likelihood of a 25 bps hike over the next two RBI meetings.
Economists at ANZ also agreed with that view.
“There is therefore greater reason for the RBI to sound more hawkish at its upcoming meeting, even if it will likely keep the repo rate unchanged,” they said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It will also possibly emphasise a larger need to be watchful of the second-round effects of high food prices and inflation expectations.”
A majority of the economists polled said rates will stay at 6.5% through the first quarter of 2024, followed by 50 basis points worth of cuts by the end of June, around the same time when markets expect the U.S. Fed to start cutting its rates.
“The bond market will take cues from the RBI’s assessment of the current spike in food prices and its impact on the overall inflation outlook and monetary policy,” said Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager- Fixed Income, Quantum AMC.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/reserve-bank-monetary-policy-2023-rbi-mpc-hawkishness-repo-rate-steady-8883537/,business
China swings into deflation as recovery falters,"China's consumer price index (CPI) for the month dropped 0.3% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday.","China’s consumer prices fell into deflation in July, while factory gate prices extended their declines, as the world’s second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and pressure mounted for authorities to release more direct stimulus.
The consumer price index (CPI) for the month dropped 0.3% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday, a slightly slower fall than the median estimate for a 0.4% decrease in a Reuters poll. It was the first year-on-year decline since February 2021. CPI was unchanged in June.
The producer price index (PPI) fell for a 10th consecutive month, down 4.4% from a year earlier after a 5.4% drop the previous month. That compared with a forecast for a 4.1% fall.
ADVERTISEMENT
China’s economic recovery slowed after a brisk start in the first quarter, as demand at home and abroad weakened. Authorities have rolled out a flurry of policy measures to support the economy, with more steps expected.
“Both CPI and PPI in year-on-year terms fell into negative territory and confirmed economic deflation,” said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ.
Xing expected the CPI to hover around 0 in the second half of the year, saying “it would be hard to manoeuvre monetary policy. The Politburo meeting called for a stable yuan exchange rate, which would conflict with monetary easing.”
Asian shares were on the defensive on Wednesday as the Chinese price data confirmed its economic recovery economy was losing steam.
ADVERTISEMENT
China’s stock- bluechip CSI300 Index and the Shanghai Composite Index both declined after the figures.
“Markets needs to see more actionable support measures from the Chinese authorities to stay upbeat,” said Frances Cheung, rates strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.
“While there is room for some mild monetary policy easing, the onus is on the fiscal side. Otherwise, economic data showing some growth improvement is required, which is not coming through yet.”
JAPAN-STYLE DEFLATION?
ADVERTISEMENT
The figures come amid mounting fears China is entering an era of much slower economic growth akin to the period of Japan’s “lost decades” since the 1990s, which saw consumer prices and wages stagnate for a generation.
China’s anaemic prices contrast sharply with the crippling inflation most other major economies have seen, which forced central banks elsewhere to rapidly raise interest rates.
However, there are also signs global inflation may be peaking and in some cases reversing with prices in Brazil sharply slowing, raising the sudden prospects of an interest rate cut in the world’s 10th largest economy.
Chinese authorities have downplayed concerns about deflation. Liu Guoqiang, deputy governor of the central bank, last month said there would be no deflationary risks in China in the second half of the year, but noted the economy needs time to return to normal after the pandemic.
The NBS said separate statement CPI was expected to rebound as the economy recovers and the relationship between supply and demand improves.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government has set a consumer inflation target of around 3% this year, which be up from 2% recorded in 2022.
Despite recent policy stimulus, consumers and manufacturers remained cautious amid the still-weak housing market and high youth unemployment, and a diminishing appetite among foreign firms to invest in China.

Bid to curb laptop imports: IT ministry meets top tech hardware companies,"The MeitY officials at the meeting included Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State for Electronics and IT.","DAYS AFTER the Centre’s flip-flop on the import of laptops, personal computers, tablets and other devices, IT Ministry officials met representatives of top electronics hardware firms on Tuesday in a bid to allay concerns about India’s trade policy stance and make a pitch for domestic manufacturing.
On August 3, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued a notification stating that companies must obtain a licence before importing laptops and other devices – to be implemented with immediate effect. Following the adverse impact, it issued another notification a day later which gave the industry a three-month reprieve. So, import of such devices will be “restricted” from November 1.

"Italy proposes bank tax to help people with interest rate hikes, sending stocks plunging","Transport Minister Matteo Salvini announced the tax at a Monday evening press conference, saying it was a measure of “social equity” to make up for a series of interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank.","Italian bank stocks plunged Tuesday after the Cabinet approved a proposal to apply a 40% tax on some bank profits this year to help consumers and businesses cope with higher borrowing costs.
Transport Minister Matteo Salvini announced the tax at a Monday evening press conference, saying it was a measure of “social equity” to make up for a series of interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank. Those increases are aimed at fighting inflation and make it more expensive for people to get loans to buy homes and cars or for companies to get new equipment or build facilities.
UniCredit shares fell over 7%, Intesa Sanpaolo was down more than 8%, Banco BPM dropped more than 8.5%, and BPER and Banca MPS both plummeted over 10% in early afternoon trading on the Milan Stock Exchange.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Association of Italian Banks has not yet commented publicly on the tax, whose approval apparently took banks by surprise. Analysts said banks would surely try to change the proposal or challenge it in court if it’s passed by Parliament, the next step in the process.
The five major Italian banks reported a combined net profit of about 10.5 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in the first half of the year, up 64% from the same period in 2022, according to credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar. It pointed to higher interest income, resilient fees and cost management.
The 40% tax would be applied to banks’ profits from the difference between the interest they pay customers on deposits and the interest they earn on loans. Salvini said the tax revenue would amount to “a few billion” euros that would be used to fund tax breaks and help first-time homeowners get mortgages. “It is a levy on banks’ extra profits,” he said, adding that the measure was proposed by Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, who didn’t attend the press conference to announce it.
The proposal must now be converted into legislation and be approved by Italy’s Parliament, where the right-wing government enjoys a comfortable majority. “Banks are widely expected to push back against the measure during the parliamentary process, but within the ruling coalition, there is a solid component supporting the move,” Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo consultancy, said in a statement. “Absent significant amendments before its parliamentary approval, the retroactive tax will likely be challenged in the courts.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The drop in Italian bank shares weighed on major banks more broadly in European markets, with Germany’s Deutsche Bank, France’s BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, Britain’s HSBC and Spain’s Banco Santander all falling in early afternoon trading.
The ECB has raised interest rates nine straight times in its campaign to stamp out high inflation unleashed by higher energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine and supply chain backups as the global economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. The bank tax was the last item announced in a series of measures adopted by Italy’s Cabinet in its final meeting before a summer pause, ranging from ending mandatory isolation for COVID-19 cases to a decision to increase the number of taxis that can operate.
The 20% increase in the number of taxi licenses that cities can issue is aimed at better responding to a boom in tourism that has created long lines at taxi stands this summer, with demand only expected to grow with the Vatican’s 2025 Jubilee, the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina and a view to Rome’s bid to host the 2030 Expo.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/italy-proposes-bank-tax-to-help-people-with-interest-rate-hikes-sending-stocks-plunging-8882683/,business
"India wheat prices jump to 6-month high on demand, limited supply",The increasing prices may prompt New Delhi to eliminate import duties on the cereal to bolster supplies and control prices ahead of key state polls and next year's general election.,"Indian wheat prices surged to a six-month high on Tuesday due to limited supplies and robust demand ahead of the festival season, dealers said.
The increasing prices may prompt New Delhi to eliminate import duties on the cereal to bolster supplies and control prices ahead of key state polls and next year’s general election.
Rising wheat prices could contribute to food inflation and potentially complicate the efforts of both the government and the central bank to contain inflation. “In all key producing states, farmer supplies have nearly come to a halt. Flour mills are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies in the market,” said a New Delhi-based trader.

Wheat prices at Indore in the central state of Madhya Pradesh rose by 1.5% on Tuesday to 25,446 rupees ($307.33) per metric ton, the highest since Feb. 10. Prices have surged by nearly 18% over the past four months.
The government should release stocks from its warehouses into the open market to avoid potential shortages during the festive season, said a Mumbai-based dealer associated with a global trade house.
As of August 1, wheat stocks in government warehouses stood at 28.3 million metric tons, an increase from the 26.6 million metric tons recorded a year earlier. “Imports are necessary to lower prices. The government cannot increase supplies without imports,” the dealer said.
India is considering cutting or even abolishing a 40% import tax on wheat and lowering a limit on the amount of wheat stocks millers and traders can hold, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said last week.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wheat output rose to a record 112.74 million metric tons in 2023, up from 107.7 million metric tons a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
India consumes around 108 million metric tons of wheat annually. But a leading trade body told Reuters in June that India’s wheat harvest in 2023 was at least 10% lower than the farm ministry’s estimate.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-wheat-prices-jump-to-6-month-high-on-demand-limited-supply-8882528/,business

With consumers largely cutting discretionary spending amid elevated global inflation, canned beverage shipments were curbed leading to soft aluminium sales during April-June.

Net sales in Hindalco’s U.S. unit Novelis, which accounts for over 63% of the company’s total revenue, fell about 20% to $4.1 billion in the quarter, it said last week.
Novelis, the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminium, reported a 25% year-on-year fall in core profit. The company said the drop was “primarily driven by lower shipments, cost inflation, and less favorable metal benefit from recycling.”
Additionally, a drop in prices of metals such as copper and aluminium during the quarter also hurt the profits of non-ferrous metal companies like Vedanta and Vedanta Group-owned Hindustan Zinc.
Hindalco’s aluminium upstream and downstream businesses experienced 7% and 11% declines in revenue, respectively, while its copper segment reported a 9% growth.

Inflation pinches: Veg thali prices rise by 34% in July,"For July, inflation is likely to rise in the range of 6-6.8 per cent from 4.81 per cent in June. Some economists believe that the RBI will revise its FY2024 CPI inflation projection upwards.","The cost of preparing a thali meal at home rose sharply for the third month in a row in July, and also inched up for the first time this fiscal when compared to the last year, mainly due to soaring tomato prices, says a Crisil report.
The cost of vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis rose 34 per cent and 13 per cent on-month, respectively, in July. Of the 34 per cent rise in the cost of a vegetarian thali, 25 per cent can be attributed solely to the price of tomato, which rose 233 per cent on month to Rs 110 per kg in July from Rs 33 per kg in June, Crisil said.

"Saudi oil giant Aramco reports $30B in Q2 profits, down nearly 40% from last year","Total sales stood at just over 400 billion riyals (about $106 billion), down from 562 billion riyals ($150 billion in the second quarter of 2022.","Saudi state-run oil giant Aramco said Monday that it made $30 billion in profit in the second quarter, a nearly 40% decline from the same period the previous year that it attributed to lower oil prices.
Total sales stood at just over 400 billion riyals (about $106 billion), down from 562 billion riyals ($150 billion in the second quarter of 2022. In an earnings report filed with the Saudi stock exchange, Aramco said the decrease “mainly reflected the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining and chemicals margins”.
The company reported net income of 112.8 billion Saudi riyals ($30 billion) compared to 181.6 billion riyals ($48 billion) in the second quarter of 2022, a decline of 37.8% Aramco nevertheless raised its dividend paid out to investors to 110.18 billion riyals ($29.38 billion), compared to $18.8 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The performance-based dividend is partly based on the company’s record earnings last year, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Our strong results reflect our resilience and ability to adapt through market cycles,” Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement accompanying the report.
Last week, Fortune magazine ranked Aramco, officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the second biggest company in the world by revenue, behind only Walmart and ahead of Amazon and Apple. The ranking came after the oil company reported a profit of over $160 billion in 2022, the largest ever recorded by a publicly traded firm.
Those kinds of earnings will come under heightened scrutiny later this year when the United Arab Emirates, another major oil producer, hosts annual UN climate talks aimed at getting the world to slash emissions and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Aramco benefited from a spike in oil prices last year caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Internationally traded oil peaked at over $120 a barrel in June 2022 before settling in a range of $75 to $85 for much of the past year.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly cut its oil production in recent months and pressed fellow OPEC members to do the same in an attempt to push up prices in the face of weaker demand from China and rising interest rates aimed at combatting inflation. The kingdom needs high oil prices to fund Vision 2030, a costly and wide-ranging plan to overhaul its economy and transform itself into a regional hub for business and tourism. The plans include several so-called “gigaprojects,” including the construction of a futuristic $500 billion city on the Red Sea coast.
ADVERTISEMENT
Saudi Arabia is also investing billions of dollars in tourism, entertainment and sports, including on a controversial merger with the PGA Tour and the recruitment of some of soccer’s biggest stars to play for local clubs.
Activists accuse the country of trying to “sportswash” a human rights record marred by its involvement in the war in neighbouring Yemen, a heavy crackdown on dissent and the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and government critic.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that Saudi Arabia needs an oil price of around $80 a barrel to avoid running a deficit. Benchmark US crude oil for September delivery rose $1.27 to $82.82 a barrel Friday. Brent crude for October delivery rose $1.10 to $86.24 a barrel.
Aramco raised a record $29.4 billion through an initial 2019 public offering in which it sold a tiny sliver of less than 2% of the company to investors.
ADVERTISEMENT
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s day-to-day ruler and the architect of Vision 2030, has transferred 8% of Aramco to the kingdom’s $700 billion sovereign wealth fund over the past two years to help shore it up as it funds the massive infrastructure projects.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reports-30b-in-q2-profits-down-nearly-40-from-last-year-8880848/,business
Sebi looking to introduce ‘MF Lite’ regulations for passive funds,"A passive fund is an investment vehicle that tracks a market index or a specific market segment. These funds include passive index funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and Fund of Funds investing in ETFs.","Capital markets regulator Sebi is engaged with the mutual fund industry to introduce ‘MF Lite’ regulations for passive funds, a move that will reduce the compliance burden and foster innovation.
A passive fund is an investment vehicle that tracks a market index or a specific market segment. These funds include passive index funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and Fund of Funds investing in ETFs.
“Since the current MF regulatory framework was built around active fund management, Sebi is planning to introduce Mutual Fund Lite regulations for passive funds, wherein investment decisions are not discretionary, but tied to changes in the underlying benchmark index,” the regulator said in its annual report for 2022-23, which was released on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
These new regulations are expected to significantly reduce the compliance requirements of passive funds and foster innovation in the passive fund ecosystem, it added.
The regular mutual fund schemes, which raise money from the public, have to comply with a number of regulations.
In regular mutual funds, investment decisions are at the discretion of the fund manager and since lakhs of small investors trust mutual funds, these have stringent requirements, including high Asset Management Companies (AMC) net worth, experienced investment team, among others, Sebi said.
However, if a mutual fund desires to offer only passive investment products such as ETFs and index funds — where investment decisions are not discretionary, but are tied to changes in the underlying benchmark index — then there is a case to provide them a regulatory framework with fewer compliance requirements, it added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Accordingly, Sebi is currently engaged with the mutual fund industry to introduce ‘MF Lite’ for such entities.
Earlier in May, Sebi Whole-Time Member Ananta Barua said the regulator will come out with mutual fund light regulations for passive funds.
In its annual report, Sebi said the current regulatory rules applicable for fees and expenses charged by mutual fund schemes will be reviewed to encourage new participants, discourage cross-subsidisation across schemes, and curb malpractices.
ADVERTISEMENT
The regulator in May came out with a consultation paper proposing sweeping changes to mutual funds’ total expense ratio, which accounts for the fees and expenses charged by AMCs.
Sebi is also considering allowing them to sell credit default swaps for the purpose of taking exposure in synthetic corporate bonds to provide additional investment products for mutual funds.
In the coming year, Sebi said it expects to see the launch of more facilities that are global firsts, such as the Investor Risk Reduction Access platform — a special window for facilitating investors to directly access the stock exchanges in the event of significant downtime of broker — and a SaaS-based model for clearing corporations to deal with cybersecurity events.
Besides, one of the key focus areas for Sebi will continue to be the facilitation of financial inclusion in the securities market in the coming years.
“We expect that technology will enable financial products and services offerings to be made available in a cost-effective manner, in every nook and corner of the country, without compromising on risk management and prudential norms as may be necessary,” Sebi said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sebi-introduce-mf-lite-regulations-passive-funds-8880812/,business
"State Bank of India bets on private capex to grow corporate credit, says chairman","About 70% of the 3.5 trillion rupees would be in term loans and help boost SBI's corporate loan book by 12%-13% this fiscal, said SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara.","State Bank of India (SBI) expects to give out 3.5 trillion rupees ($42.30 billion) in corporate loans over the rest of this financial year as private companies step up investments in key sectors, the chairman of the country’s largest lender said.
The Indian economy has been starved of private investment for years now but a surge in government capital spending and deleveraged corporate balance sheets has led to early signs of companies adding to their capacity.
And nearly 80% of this incremental loan demand is coming from the private sector, SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara told Reuters in an interview over the weekend.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Invariably there is a rub-off effect on small and medium enterprises also.”
About 70% of the 3.5 trillion rupees would be in term loans and help boost SBI’s corporate loan book by 12%-13% this fiscal, said Khara.
“New projects are coming into greenfield sectors like renewable energy, batteries and battery storage as well as EVs (electric vehicles) among others,” he said.
“In the core sectors, it is essentially the addition to capacity in sectors like steel, cement, road infrastructure and airports.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SBI’s total domestic advances were 28 trillion rupees as of June 30.
Credit demand in India has been mostly for home, auto and personal loans and SBI has been very “mindful” of the potential stress this segment could cause, given high interest rates.
Over 80% of SBI’s retail loans are to its salary-account holders, giving it greater visibility on a borrower’s cash flow.
In June, Reuters reported bankers expect the central bank to increase risk weights on unsecured personal loans and credit cards to cool demand.
This, Khara said, would make credit expensive for consumers.
“High-cost consumption credit is not a good idea.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SBI’s stock has gained over 9% in the past 12 months, less than the 15% rise in the broader BSE Bankex index.
Analysts have often said SBI, with a market capitalisation of 5.08 trillion rupees, is undervalued since its share price does not capture the value of its subsidiaries.
“The valuation of the top four or five entities is about 2.5-3 trillion (rupees) … of both listed and unlisted companies,” Khara estimated.
But SBI does not have any immediate monetisation plans.
“Maybe in a year or two, we might decide about listing SBI General Life Insurance. Monetising the stake in SBI Mutual Fund is not a focus for us currently.”
At 14.56%, SBI is adequately capitalised, Khara said, adding SBI will ensure capital is not a constraint to supporting balance sheet growth.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/state-bank-of-india-private-capex-grow-corporate-credit-dinesh-kumar-khara-8880599/,business

The 1 crore ITR filing milestone was also reached 13 days ahead on June 26 in the current fiscal, compared to July 8 last financial year.

After posting losses since inception in 2015, Meesho, which is backed by Japan’s SoftBank, recorded profits for the first time last month, it said in a statement.

“Since we just turned from negative to positive, it’s a small nominal kind of number, single digit of course… We intend to continue the profitability trajectory,” he said without sharing specifics.
An initial public offering (IPO) is now being planned in the next 12-18 months, Bansal added.
“We feel that the growth, scale and profitability are there (for an IPO), but you also want to make sure that there is enough of a track record for market investors to look at.”

Meesho, which was founded by Indian Institute of Technology graduates Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, clocked more than 1 billion orders in the last 12 months.

Automobile retail sales rise 10% in July: FADA,"Auto mobile retail sales in India witnessed a 10 per cent annual growth in July driven by robust sales across passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, industry body FADA said.","Auto mobile retail sales in India witnessed a 10 per cent annual growth in July driven by robust sales across passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, industry body FADA said on Monday.
Total retail sales across segments rose to 17,70,181 units last month, as compared to 16,09,217 units in July 2022.
Passenger vehicle sales saw an increase of 4 per cent to 2,84,064 units last month, as compared to 2,73,055 units in the year-ago period, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said in a statement.

“The month saw a surge in orders and timely OEM supplies, especially with the introduction of new products. However, severe monsoons and flood-like situations especially in North India, impacted sales,” FADA President Manish Raj Singhania said.
SUVs continued to remain a popular choice for buyers, he added.
Two-wheeler retail sales rose by 8 per cent to 12,28,139 in July, as against 11,35,566 units in the same period last year.
Singhania said despite challenges like heavy monsoons and a tilt towards EVs, the two-wheeler segment showed resilience with increased demand and trust in reputable brands.

Commercial vehicle retail sales saw a 2 per cent year-on-year jump in sales to 73,065 units, from 71,619 units in July 2022.
“The CV segment showed mixed dynamics. Despite robust stock availability and growth in areas like school buses, challenges from erratic weather and high vehicle costs affected demand,” Singhania said.
Three-wheeler sales rose 74 per cent year-on-year, while tractor sales witnessed a healthy growth of 21 per cent last month.

FADA, which represents over 15,000 automobile dealers, said it remains cautious in terms of business outlook going ahead.
“While caution remains the operative word in the short term, FADA is hopeful about retail growth prospects, especially with the festive season on the horizon,” it said.
The entry-level category in the two-wheeler segment continues to be a cause for concern, FADA said.
In the CV space, there are apprehensions regarding streamlined loan disbursements for buyers, it added.
Besides, inventory level in PV has breached the 50-days mark in anticipation of upcoming festival season and the slowdown in entry-level car vertical remains, FADA said.

The dearness allowance for employees and pensioners is worked out on the basis of the latest Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) brought out by the Labour Bureau every month. The Labour Bureau is a wing of the Labour Ministry.
Talking to PTI, All India Railwaymen Federation General Secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra said, “The CPI-IW for June 2023 was released on July 31, 2023. We are demanding a four percentage point hike in dearness allowance. But the dearness allowance hike works out to be a little over three percentage points. The government does not factor in hiking DA beyond the decimal point. Thus DA is likely to be increased by three percentage points to 45 per cent”.

He further explained that the expenditure department of the Finance Ministry will formulate a proposal to hike DA along with its revenue implication and will put up the proposal before the Union Cabinet for approval.
The DA hike will be effective from July 1, 2023.
Presently, over one crore central government employees and pensioners are getting a 42 per cent dearness allowance.
The last revision in DA was done on March 24, 2023, and was effective from January 1, 2023. The Centre had increased DA by four percentage points to 42 per cent based on the percentage increase in the 12 monthly average of the All India Consumer Price Index for the period ending December 2022.
The DA is provided to employees and pensioners to compensate them for rising prices. The cost of living increases over a period of time and is reflected through CPI-IW.

Vedanta looks to refinance $3.8 bn bonds,"The mining conglomerate has about USD 1 billion of bonds maturing in January next year, followed by a similar size coming up for payment in August 2024.","Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources is looking to refinance USD 3.8 billion worth of bonds maturing between 2024 and 2026 with loans of extended maturities and manageable size, a company official said on Friday.
The mining conglomerate has about USD 1 billion of bonds maturing in January next year, followed by a similar size coming up for payment in August 2024. Another USD 1.2 billion bonds are due in March 2025 and another USD 600 million in April 2026.
“We are looking to put in place a refinancing package that will include deleveraging (some debt), extending maturities and manageable size,” said Omar Davis, President – Strategy at Vedanta Resources.
ADVERTISEMENT
He did not give details of the refinancing but expressed confidence in being able to achieve well before due maturities. “We want less big towers (size of loans) and longer maturity periods,” he said.
On Thursday, S&P Global Ratings revised the rating outlook on Vedanta Resources to negative from stable to “reflect the heightened refinancing risk”.
At the same time, it affirmed its ‘B-‘ long-term issuer credit rating on the company, anticipating it will raise more funds before end-2023.
“Vedanta Resources’ large debt maturities that require external financing present downside rating risk,” it had said. “We estimate the company will have a funding gap of as much as USD 2 billion until August 2024.” Vedanta Resources has debt maturities of about USD 3 billion from now until August 2024, it said.

Davis however said the amount being mentioned also includes bank loans. He said the company raised USD 500 million by selling part of its stake in 64 per cent-owned Vedanta Ltd together with dividends and brand fees.
Vedanta is sure about its deleveraging and degreasing plans and has clear sight over dividend and cash flow from operating companies, which gives it the comfort of refinancing the bonds maturing between 2024 and 2026, he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/vedanta-looks-to-refinance-3-8-bn-bonds-8877092/,business

Indian economy’s domestic dynamics continue to be strong: FinMin report,Inflation data released on July 12 had shown that headline retail inflation rate increased to 4.81 per cent in June from 4.31 per cent in May primarily due to a sharp increase in food inflation to 4.49 per cent from 2.96 per cent.,"The Indian economy’s domestic dynamics continue to be strong though negative cross-border spillovers and adverse global developments can act anytime as a deterrent to achieve the potential high growth path in the current financial year, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday in its monthly economic review for June 2023. The ministry also pointed out that though inflation has “significantly declined” in June quarter, the recent spike in the prices of ‘fruits,’ ‘vegetables,’ and ‘pulses and products due to weather-related disruptions has led to a sequential increase in food inflation in June 2023, emphasising the need for a “guarded approach by RBI and the government”.
“In the case of India as well, inflation has significantly declined in the June 2023 quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year and has entered the tolerance band of the RBI. The core inflation has also been softening since the beginning of the June 2023 quarter, indicating a restoration of overall price stability in the economy. However, the recent spike in the prices of ‘fruits,’ ‘vegetables,’ and ‘pulses and products owing to weather-related disruptions has led to a sequential increase in food inflation for the month of June 2023. As inflation has been reined in only recently while threats of supply-side shocks, including El Nino, persist, the RBI and the government continue to be guarded for appropriate and timely policy response,” the review stated.

India’s services PMI at 13-year high in July on strong demand,"India's dominant services sector expanded at its fastest pace in 13 years last month as demand increased significantly despite elevated inflationary pressures, a business survey showed on Thursday.","India’s dominant services sector expanded at its fastest pace in 13 years last month as demand increased significantly despite elevated inflationary pressures, a business survey showed on Thursday.
S&P Global’s India services purchasing managers’ index rose to 62.3 in July from June’s 58.5, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 58.0. It was the highest index reading since June 2010 and has remained above the 50-mark that separates growth from expansion for two years.
“The resilience of the service sector underscores its vital role in fuelling India’s economy, with the PMI results for July so far pointing to a notable contribution from the sector to overall GDP for the second fiscal quarter,” noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
ADVERTISEMENT
India’s economy is expected to grow 6.2% in the July-September quarter, according to the latest Reuters survey.
Overall demand remained strong. While the new business sub-index showed demand had risen since August 2021, the pace of growth was the highest since June 2010.
International demand also gathered steam, rising significantly in July and was the second-strongest since the series started in September 2014.
Inflation in India rose to 4.81% in June, due to surging vegetables prices. Though within the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2%-6% target range, the central bank was not expected to cut rates anytime soon.

Operating costs rose at the fastest pace since June 2022 and firms passed on some of that burden to customers, albeit at the slowest pace in three months as they were cautious about their pricing strategies.
“Looking at PMI price indices in recent months, it seems that competitive advantage continued to support demand for Indian services, with increases in output prices here modest relative to several other nations,” added De Lima.
Although the future activity sub-index, which measures optimism, slipped from June’s six-month high over concerns surrounding extreme weather, the year-ahead outlook remained strong.

"Morgan Stanley upgrades India’s rating to overweight, downgrades China’s to equal weight","Morgan Stanley said that the country's macro indicators remain resilient, and added that India's economy is on track to achieve the GDP forecast of 6.2 per cent.","Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley on late Wednesday upgraded India’s outlook to ‘overweight,’ saying that the firm believes that the country is just at the start of a long-wave boom. This comes four months after the firm upgraded India’s outlook to equal weight from underweight on March 31.
An overweight outlook means that Morgan Stanley expects India’s economy to perform better in the future.
In a note, Morgan Stanley said that the country’s macro indicators remain resilient, and added that India’s economy is on track to achieve the GDP forecast of 6.2 per cent.

It said that there are things that have fundamentally changed in India, including structural reforms, supply-side reforms like corporate tax cuts and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, and regulation and formalisation of the economy.
Morgan Stanley analysts said, “We see a secular trend towards sustained superior earnings per share (EPS) growth versus EM over the cycle,” and added that a young demographic profile is supporting equity inflows.
With this upgrade, India is now the top ranked, most-preferred market among emerging markets (EMs), the brokerage said.
Morgan Stanley’s upgrade on India comes when it also cut its rating for China to equal weight and said investors should capitalise on a rally spurred by government stimulus pledges to take profits.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We think returning India to an “overweight” rating and downgrading China to “equal weight” is warranted,” Morgan Stanley analysts said, referring to the Indian markets’ outperformance over China as a sign of a structural breakout in favour of New Delhi.
The firm said it also expects the BSE benchmark index, Sensex, to reach 68,500 points by December. It said Sensex will trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of 20.5 times compared to a 25-year average of 20 times.
The premium over the historical average reflects greater confidence in medium-term growth, Morgan Stanley said in its outlook.
ADVERTISEMENT
Morgan Stanley’s target for Sensex is based on multiple factors, such as the absence of major upward movements in commodity prices, the US escaping a recession, and the Reserve Bank of India maintaining a pause in its repo rate hikes.

"Adani Group acquires majority stake in Sanghi Industries for Rs 5,000 crore","“This landmark acquisition is a significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerating growth journey,” Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group said in a statement.","Ambuja Cements Ltd (ACL) on Thursday announced the acquisition of majority stake in Sanghi Industries Ltd (SIL) at an enterprise value of Rs 5,000 crore. The acquisition includes a cement plant and captive jetties in Gujarat which will allow Ambuja to directly transport its products through the coastal route to states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.
According to an official statement from the company, “ACL will acquire 56.74 per cent shares of SIL from its existing promoter group, Ravi Sanghi and family. The acquisition will be fully funded through internal accruals.”
The acquisition is expected to bring all the assets in Kutch district, most of which were built by the Sanghi Group after the Kutch earthquake of 2001. This includes the Sanghi Cement plant that was commissioned in 2002 as the world’s largest single stream cement plant located at Sanghipuram in Abdasa taluka of Kutch.

With 2,700 hectares of land, the integrated unit at Sanghipuram has two kilns with a clinker production capacity of 6.6 MTPA and a cement grinding unit with a capacity of 6.1 MTPA. It also has a captive power plant of 130 MW and a Waste Heat Recovery System of 13 MW. The unit is also connected with a captive jetty at Sanghipuram.
The company also stated that jetty at Sanghipuram will be expanded to handle vessel sizes of 8,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage).
Bulk terminals and grinding units will be created along the western coast to enable movement of clinker and cement through the sea route at the lowest possible cost. SIL also has a bulk cement terminal each at Navlakhi Port in Gujarat and Dharamtar Port in Maharashtra.
The acquisition is also expected to help Ambuja tap the fly-ash produced at Adani Group’s thermal power plants in Mundra for the acquired cement facility.

With SIL’s limestone reserves of a billion tonnes, ACL has targeted to increase cement capacity at Sanghipuram to 15 MTPA in the next two years. ACL will also invest in expanding the captive port at Sanghipuram to handle larger vessels. Our aim is to make SIL lowest cost producer of Clinker in the country,” Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group stated.
“With this acquisition, the Adani Group is well on course to achieve its target of 140 MTPA of cement manufacturing capacity by 2028 ahead of time,” he added.
Karan Adani, the non-executive non-independent director of the company also had a similar view. “Our vision is to produce lowest cost clinker in the country at Sanghipuram and then transport clinker as well as bulk cement through coastal route to the market of Saurashtra, South Gujarat, Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan region, Karnataka and Kerela. Synergy with the assets of Adani ports will help us accelerate in implementation of this strategy. With the right implementation we are very confident that we would be the lowest cost supplier of cement in all these markets,” Karan stated.

The acquisition of SIL will help ACL to strengthen its market leadership and increase its cement capacity to 73.6 MTPA from the current 67.5 MTPA.

28% GST stays on online gaming and casinos but review after six months,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision was not taken with consensus, as had happened at the time of the GST change on lottery, with some states registering dissent but most states asking for early implementation of the decision taken at the last Council meeting.","Although some states differed on the valuation norms and tax levy on online gaming and casinos, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, in its 51st meeting via videoconferencing Wednesday, decided to levy 28 per cent tax at face value at entry level.
The Council, however, gave some relief by deciding not to impose the tax levy on the amount entered into games/bets out of winnings of previous games/bets in online money gaming or on total value of each bet placed, as would be the case in casinos.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision was not taken with consensus, as had happened at the time of the GST change on lottery, with some states registering dissent but most states asking for early implementation of the decision taken at the last Council meeting.

In its previous meeting on July 11, the GST Council had decided to levy a uniform 28 per cent tax on full face value for online gaming, casinos and horse racing.

The new tax levy is now expected to be effective from October 1. A review would be undertaken after six months of the implementation, Sitharaman, who heads the Council, said.
“The valuation may be done based on the amount paid or payable or deposited with the supplier by or on behalf of the player, excluding the amount entered into games bets out of winnings of previous games and bets, and not on the total value of each bets placed… (GST will be on) entry (level) whatever they pay to get chips and not what they pay in each game,” she said.

— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) August 2, 2023
Citing remarks shared by the Meghalaya Chief Minister at the Council meeting, she also pointed out that the prevailing practice is of 18 per cent GST on gross gaming revenue or platform fee, which results in net revenue of only 8-9 per cent.
“Assuming today’s 18 per cent on GGR becomes 28 per cent on GGR, we will be collecting only around 11-12 per cent… at the current collections, it is far lesser than the tax we levy on some of the essential goods for households. This is gaming, you are wagering on it,” she said.

Giving an example, she said if a bet is placed for say Rs 1,000, and the player wins Rs 300, and if the player again places a bet of Rs 1,300, then GST will not be levied on the winning amount of Rs 300.
Officials would now work on the legal amendments, which are expected to be taken up in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, following which states will also pass respective amendments in the state GST laws.
“When the question of when to implement it came, October 1 is when it is expected, by which time the states will also pass the amendments to their state laws… because of the casinos, Goa and Sikkim kept appealing saying that they are small states and need to be given some consideration… The Council agreed today to come back after six months to review the way in which this is getting implemented. When I say six months, it’s not six months from today but six months from when this gets implemented,” Sitharaman said.

At least three states recorded their dissent during the Council meeting, with Delhi having asked for a complete review for online gaming. Goa and Sikkim asked for GST to be levied on gross gaming revenue even as they supported a higher 28 per cent rate, Sitharaman said.
Tamil Nadu, which has already banned online gaming, also asked for the legal amendment to take the ban into account such that online gaming does not become taxable in the state.
Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said that Tamil Nadu had some issues which will be resolved with them.
“It should not happen that by making these changes, online gaming also becomes legal. So we told them that betting is already liable to GST today in the Act. That does not make betting legal, if it is illegal, which it is. Betting and gambling are illegal in the country, other than horse racing and some specific cases… if betting and gambling are illegal but still liable to tax, just by including online gaming within the purview of the Act and making them liable to tax will not result in legalising online gaming in their state if they have banned it or they have made it illegal,” he said.
Other states such as Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Bihar asked the Council to implement its decision from the last meeting at the earliest, Sitharaman said.

Offshore gaming platforms will have to register themselves with the GST authorities, Malhotra said, adding that in case they do not follow the law, the government will invoke the provisions of the Information Technology Act to block those sites. Any payments through virtual digital assets will also attract the GST rate of 28 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Centre filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, challenging the recent Karnataka High Court ruling that quashed a Rs 21,000-crore show-cause tax notice issued to Bengaluru-based Gameskraft Technology Private Ltd (GTPL). The Revenue Secretary said a 28% tax on online gaming was always there and the Council is just clarifying the position and they would go by the Court decision on the matter.

A joint statement by The Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports and E-Gaming Federation said, “FIFS & EGF, which represent 50 Indian online gaming companies, appreciate the Government addressing the industry’s concerns on the issue of repeat taxation. The new tax framework, while clarifying and resolving uncertainty, will lead to a very burdensome 350% increase in GST and set the Indian online gaming industry back several years. However, it will allow gaming companies a fighting chance to innovate and rebuild the foundation of gaming in India.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/28-gst-on-online-gaming-effective-from-oct-1-review-next-year-fm-sitharaman-8873549/,business

Record Urals volumes boost India’s Russian oil imports in July,India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement.,"After falling sequentially in June, India’s Russian oil imports in July recovered to almost touch the all-time high level of 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) seen in May, thanks to a jump in import volumes of Moscow’s flagship Urals crude, data shared by energy cargo tracker Vortexa showed.
Going ahead, however, imports of Russian oil by Indian refiners could see some moderation due to various factors, which include export cuts by Russia and higher demand from Russian refineries, erosion in discounts offered by Moscow on its oil, and Urals breaching the G7 price cap of $60 per barrel.

BYJU’S sends legal notice to Aakash founders demanding share transfer,"In 2021, BYJU'S acquired 33-year-old brick-and-mortar coaching centre AESL for nearly $40 million in a cash and stock deal.","Education technology startup Think and Learn Pvt Ltd, which operates under BYJU’S brand name, has sent a legal notice to founders of Aakash Educational Services following their alleged resistance to complete a share swap that was unconditionally agreed as part of the sale of Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL), sources said.
In 2021, BYJU’S acquired 33-year-old brick-and-mortar coaching centre AESL for nearly USD 940 million in a cash and stock deal. Post deal, TLPL owned 43 per cent while its founder Byju Raveendran another 27 per cent. Founder Chaudhry’s family maintains about 18 per cent in AESL and Blackstone the remaining 12 per cent.
The deal envisaged AESL merging with TLPL as it was more tax efficient for the seller Chaudhrys.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, due to delays in the proposed merger by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), TLPL has invoked the unconditional fallback agreement and issued a notice to Chaudhrys, requesting the execution of the swap deal.
But the minority shareholders have declined to swap their equity holding in AESL with the firm’s parent TLPL, three sources aware of the matter said.
Around 70 per cent of the 2021 acquisition was made in cash, and the rest was meant to be adjusted against the equity of TLPL.
Sources said Blackstone and the Chaudhry family have written to BYJU’S in the last few weeks, declining to comply with a TLPL notice sent in March to execute the share swap as per the original agreement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Upon completion of the existing share swap obligation, the Chaudhry family’s stake in TLPL would be slightly below one per cent.
Chaudhrys could face demands from the tax authorities, including on GST, in the swap deal, they said, adding that Chaudhrys are eyeing a cash payout instead of a swap.
BYJU’S declined to comment on the development while the query sent to AESL did not elicit any reply.

Sources said the share swap was an integral part of the acquisition agreement. The intention was to affect the share swap through a merger of AESL with TLPL, allowing for enhanced tax efficiency for the seller, Chaudhrys, they added.

Reliance signs pact with Brookfield for Australia renewable energy venture,Reliance Industries Ltd said it has signed a pact with Brookfield Asset Management to explore opportunities for setting up factories to manufacture renewable energy and decarbonisation equipment in Australia.,"Reliance Industries Ltd on Tuesday said it has signed a pact with Brookfield Asset Management to explore opportunities for setting up factories to manufacture renewable energy and decarbonisation equipment in Australia.
Brookfield will work with Reliance to explore avenues of direct capital investment and evaluate setting up operations in Australia to make or assemble renewable energy equipment and supply, the company said in a statement.
The Australia investment will complement giga-factories that Reliance is building at Jamnagar in Gujarat to produce solar cells and modules, energy storage batteries, fuel cells and green hydrogen.
ADVERTISEMENT
The memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Reliance and Brookfield “aims to both accelerate and de-risk Australia’s energy transition by enabling it to locally produce clean energy equipment such as PV modules, long duration battery storage and components for wind energy,” it said.
Under the terms of the MoU, Brookfield will work with Reliance to explore avenues of direct capital investment and development of skills, knowledge and expertise in the renewable energy sector of Australia to facilitate the nation’s transition to a net-zero future.
“Reliance has strong expertise in solar panel technology and long duration battery storage technology. It is currently in the process of setting up one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India,” the statement said.
The MoU with Reliance is one of the key initiatives being undertaken by Brookfield to bring global manufacturing technology and expertise to Australia.
ADVERTISEMENT
In March this year, it signed a binding agreement with EIG to acquire Origin Energy. The proposed acquisition is currently going through the relevant approvals processes.
As part of its proposed acquisition of the Origin Energy Markets division, Brookfield along with its institutional partners and global institutional investors GIC and Temasek have set out a plan to invest between A$20 billion and A$30 billion over the next ten years to accelerate its energy transition.
“The MoU with Reliance intends to support this investment to ensure consistent and adequate supply of the clean energy equipment required to develop up to 14 GW of new, large-scale generation and storage capacity in Australia,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Independent analysis undertaken for Brookfield indicates the establishment of onshore sovereign manufacturing capability for the energy transition has the potential to create approximately 18,000 direct and indirect jobs.
Luke Edwards, Brookfield Renewable Head of Australia, said: “The energy transition creates an opportunity to bring advanced manufacturing processes created offshore to Australia, which would secure the supply of critical equipment for the transition to help drive down Australia’s emissions faster and contribute significantly to job creation.” “We want to help kickstart a new era in local manufacturing that will benefit domestic renewables developers, including Origin Energy Markets, and many communities around Australia.
“We are establishing these types of global partnerships in manufacturing now to allow us to get started as quickly as possible given the ever-reducing timeline for Australia to reach its first emissions-reductions targets in 2030,” Edwards said.
Anant Ambani, Director, Reliance New Energy Ltd, said: “At Reliance, we are firmly committed to the mission of creating a global clean energy ecosystem that is both beneficial to humanity and compatible with nature. Towards this end, Reliance is pursuing opportunities of investment in India and globally with great enthusiasm and passion.
“We are confident that Reliance and Brookfield will explore avenues in green energy in Australia, accelerating the nation’s transition to a Net Zero future and providing a fillip to the global green energy movement.” Brookfield is uniquely placed to support these manufacturing initiatives given its track record in committing long-term capital to enable the energy transition, and its innovative approach to large-scale investments in re-shoring of essential and strategic manufacturing processes and supply chains such as its investment in the USD 30 billion Intel Chip plant in Nevada.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/reliance-pact-brookfield-australia-renewable-energy-venture-8871055/,business
"Petrol demand rises in July, rains continue to cut into diesel sales","India's petrol consumption rose in July, but diesel demand fell owing to monsoon rains and floods in some parts of the country, preliminary industry data showed on Tuesday.","India’s petrol consumption rose in July, but diesel demand fell owing to monsoon rains and floods in some parts of the country, preliminary industry data showed on Tuesday.
Consumption of diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country accounting for about two-fifths of the demand, fell 4.3 per cent to 6.15 million tonne in July compared to the year-ago period.
Consumption had fallen by a steep 15 per cent in first half of July but picked up in the second fortnight.
ADVERTISEMENT
Diesel sales typically fall in monsoon months as rains lower demand in the agriculture sector which uses the fuel for irrigation, harvesting and transportation. Also, rains slow vehicular movements.
Consumption of diesel had soared 6.7 per cent and 9.3 per cent in April and May, respectively as agriculture demand picked up and cars yanked up air-conditioning to beat the summer heat. It started to taper in the second half of June after the monsoon set in.
Month-on-month sales fell 13.7 per cent, when compared with 7.13 million tonne of diesel consumed in June.
Petrol sales however rose 3.8 per cent to 2.76 million tonne in July when compared with the same period last year. Consumption had dropped 10.5 per cent in the first fortnight of July but picked up in the latter half. Sales were down 4.6 per cent month-on-month, the data showed.

Both the manufacturing and services sectors in India have been in expansion territory to support oil demand for over one year.
This led to petrol and diesel sales rising since the second half of March.
For the year, India’s oil demand is forecast at 0.2 million barrels per day year-on-year, according to oil cartel OPEC’s monthly oil bulletin.

Consumption of petrol during July was 16.6 per cent more than in COVID-marred July 2021 and 20.8 per cent more than in pre-pandemic July 2019.
Diesel consumption was up 12.8 per cent over July 2021 but almost flat when compared with July 2019.
With the continuing rise in passenger traffic at airports, jet fuel (ATF) demand rose 10.3 per cent to 603,500 tonne during July as compared to the same period last year.
It was more than double that of July 2021, but 2.9 per cent lower than pre-COVID July 2019.
Month-on-month jet fuel sales was up 1.6 per cent when compared with 594,100 tonne in June 2023.

ED searches premises of Hero group’s Pawan Munjal,"The investigation stems from a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) complaint against a person, allegedly close to Munjal, who was investigated on charges of carrying undeclared foreign currency.","THE ENFORCEMENT Directorate (ED) on Tuesday conducted searches at the residential and business premises of Hero MotoCorp executive chairperson Pawan Kant Munjal and others as part of a money laundering investigation.
The searches were carried out at the properties of the 69-year-old Munjal, the promoter of India’s largest two-wheeler automobiles manufacturer, in Delhi and Gurgaon apart from that of some entities linked to him, sources said.
The searches were carried out in connection with a case the ED lodged under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “Officials from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) today visited two of our offices in Delhi and Gurugram and the residence of our Executive Chairman Dr Pawan Munjal. We continue to extend all cooperation to the agency,” the company said in a statement.

The ED case stems from a complaint filed against Munjal by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, an investigative arm of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.
In March 2022, the Income Tax Department had conducted searches on multiple premises of Hero MotoCorp. Tax officials had said the search operations were part of a tax evasion investigation against the company.
“During the course of the search operation, various incriminating documents and digital evidence were found and seized indicating that the expenses ostensibly shown to have been claimed towards business purposes are not fully supported by evidence,” Surabhi Ahluwalia, official spokesperson for the Central Board of Direct Taxes, had said then.
“Expenditure aggregating to more than Rs 800 crore has been booked in the guise of purchase of services from a specific event management entity. This entity has siphoned off the money by way of layering. Such claims towards non-business purposes are inadmissible expenditure under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961,” Ahluwalia had said.

“In the search, it was also found that 10 acres of farm land at Delhi was purchased through a few paper companies. In such transactions, an unaccounted cash component of over Rs 60 crore was purportedly involved. The ultimate/real beneficiary of the land deal is a prominent person of the automobile manufacturer group.

"Automated IGST refunds on pan masala, tobacco, similar items to be restricted from October 1","Exporters of such items will have to approach jurisdictional Tax officers with their refund claims and get them cleared, as per a notification dated July 31.","Automated refund of Integrated GST (IGST) on export of pan masala, tobacco, and similar other items will be restricted from October 1, the finance ministry has said.
Exporters of such items will have to approach jurisdictional Tax officers with their refund claims and get them cleared, as per a notification dated July 31.
The changes in the notification will come into effect from October 1.

Tax experts said the move is aimed at checking tax evasion in the sector, as there might be over-valuation of goods which are being exported, thus leading to higher IGST refund outgo.
Manual checking of refunds will ensure that valuation is optimally done and taxes are paid at all stages.
The items on which automated IGST refund restriction has been imposed include pan masala, unmanufactured tobacco, hookah, gutkha, smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes and other items, including mentha oil. Such items attract 28 per cent IGST, plus a cess.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said such restriction on automated refunds for pan masala Tobacco & other similar items would lead to a blip in exporters’ cash flow, reduce global competitiveness in the sector, and increase compliance and administrative burden on the exporters.

Restricting IGST refunds may lead to a temporary increase in tax revenue for the government, as the refund amount will remain with the government for a more extended period.
“India is one of the world’s major exporters of pan masala, primarily to countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and some African nations. Therefore, exporters of pan masala may see a constrained cash flow position in the last quarter of 2023, impacting normal course of business,” Mohan added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/automated-igst-refunds-pan-masala-tobacco-similar-items-restricted-from-october-1-8870899/,business
"India to flag concerns over EU’s carbon tax, deforestation regulation in WTO meet next year","India will address concerns on EU's climate regulations, including carbon tax and deforestation rules, during the WTO ministerial meet, seeking resolution for domestic industries","Developing countries like India will flag serious concerns over the impact of European Union’s (EU) regulations on climate change and trade such as carbon tax, on their domestic industry, during WTO ministerial meeting next year, an official said.
The four-day 13th ministerial conference (MC) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is scheduled for February 26 next year in Abu Dhabi. MC is the highest decision making body of WTO.
“These issues will come up in the WTO in a big way. Countries like India will oppose these measures in the WTO,” the official said.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the first seven months of this year, the EU has introduced four regulations on climate change and trade. These are carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM); deforestation regulation; including shipping in the EU’s emissions trade system; and Foreign subsidies regulation. EU member Germany too has announced a supply chain due diligence act (SCDDA).
“This will become a major issue in the MC13. Many member countries have already submitted papers against some of these regulations in the WTO. It looks like discussions will happen on these regulations and a general view will also converge,” the government official, who did not wish to be named, said.
Geneva-based 164 member multi-lateral body WTO deals with global exports and import-related norms. Besides, it adjudicates trade disputes between the member countries.
According to think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the EU will collect billions annually once these provisions come into operation completely. They need these funds to provide subsidies to their companies and farmers.
ADVERTISEMENT
The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will have an adverse impact on India’s exports of metals such as iron, steel and aluminium products to the EU. It will come into force from October 1 this year. CBAM will translate into a 20-35 per cent tax on select imports into the EU starting January 1, 2026.
From January 1, 2026, the EU will start collecting the carbon tax on each consignment of steel, aluminium, cement, fertilizer, hydrogen and electricity.
In 2022, India’s 27 per cent exports of iron, steel, and aluminium products of value USD 8.2 billion went to the EU.
ADVERTISEMENT
Further, India’s exports of products like coffee, leather hides and paperboard worth USD 1.3 billion annually to the EU will get impacted due to European Union Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (EU-DR).
The regulation covers cattle, buffalo, the meat of bovine animals, preparations, oil cake, soya beans, palm oil, cocoa bean, powder, chocolate, coffee, leather hide, skin, paper, paperboard, wood, wood articles, wood pulp, boards and wood furniture.
The exporters now have to ensure that these products have been grown on land, which has not been deforested after December 31, 2020.
The new rules will apply to large firms after 18 months and small firms after 24 months. Thus, the timeline for large firms is December 2024 and for small firms is June 2025.
As the EU parliament has included shipping in its emissions trade system on April 18 this year, it will charge a carbon tax like levy from EU’s inbound and outbound shipping firms from January 1, 2027.
ADVERTISEMENT
Similarly, under the Foreign subsidies regulation, which came into force on January 12 this year, the EU can investigate cases where foreign subsidies distort competition within the region.
The German law to prohibit forced labour and protect human rights in global business supply chains will have little impact on India’s trade with the European country as India already has comprehensive rules to deal with these issues, according to a report by GTRI.
ADVERTISEMENT
Germany has banned forced labour and other labour law violations in its supply chains extending within and outside Germany. The law, SCDDA, came into effect from January 1 this year.
It applies to firms with more than 3,000 employees. These include German firms and foreign firms doing business with Germany.

India is already engaging bilaterally with the European Union on these issues.
India’s exports to the EU has increased to USD 74.9 billion in 2022-23 from about USD 65 billion in 2021-22. The EU accounts for over 16 per cent of India’s total merchandise exports.

India sees 7% drop in gold demand in April-June qtr due to record high prices: WGC,"Gold imports saw a 16 per cent jump to 209 tonnes during Q2 of 2023, from the year-ago period on account of stocking, WGC said in its latest report released on Tuesday.","Gold demand in India, the world’s second-largest consumer, declined by seven per cent to 158.1 tonnes during the April-June quarter of this year in reaction to record high prices in the domestic market, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).
However, gold imports saw a 16 per cent jump to 209 tonnes during Q2 of 2023, from the year-ago period on account of stocking, WGC said in its latest report released on Tuesday.
With the first half of 2023 demand estimated at 271 tonnes, the full-year gold demand could be in the range of 650-750 tonnes in 2023, it added.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The 7 per cent decline in Q2 gold demand is due to prevailing record high gold prices, which significantly impacted affordability and consumer sentiment,” WGC India Regional CEO Somasundaram PR told PTI.
There was a sharp rise in yellow metal prices in a very short span of time to a peak of Rs 64,000 per 10 gram. Also, some demand got shaved off due to the overall tax compliance in the country, he said.
As per the WGC report, the country’s gold demand dropped by 7 per cent to 158.1 tonnes in Q2 of this year, from 170.7 tonnes in the year-ago period.
In value terms, India’s Q2 gold demand was Rs 82,530 crores, an increase of four per cent from Rs 79,270 crores in the year-ago period.
ADVERTISEMENT
Out of the total gold demand, jewellery demand declined by eight per cent to 128.6 tonnes during the second quarter of this year, when compared with 140.3 tonnes in the year-ago period.
According to the report, 18k gold jewellery continued on an upward trend, as consumers were attracted by the affordability of these products.
Bar and coins demand also saw a marginal three per cent decline to 29.5 tonnes during Q2 of 2023, as against 30.4 tonnes in the year-ago period, the report said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Given the gold price, it would have been reasonable to expect far weaker gold jewellery demand. But arguably the supportive economic backdrop helped, with GDP growth forecast to increase by 6.3 per cent for FY 2023-24.
“A knee jerk reaction to the ban of 2,000 rupee notes during the quarter had a brief but notable impact on gold demand,” it said.
Although demand has held up relatively well so far this year, the report said, “we are cautious regarding H2 prospects.” Local prices, although off their record highs, remain elevated. And although the domestic economy remains relatively healthy, there are indications of a slowdown in discretionary spending, with FMCG sales apparently declining during the quarter, it said.
“The success – or otherwise – of the monsoon season will also have a considerable bearing on demand for the remainder of the year,” it noted.
According to the report, gold recycling in India witnessed a sharp spike during the quarter, with an increase by 61 per cent to 37.6 tonnes, compared to the previous year.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Many consumers would have opted to book profits from historic high gold prices.” Asked about the impact of curbs imposed last month on import of certain gold items, Somasundaram said it was done to plug loopholes as people were using free trade agreements with Indonesia to get concession gold jewellery.
“This regulation will not impact imports. Anyways, jewellery is not freely importable,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, Somasundaram said, “We remain cautious about gold demand as it faces uncertainties due to elevated local prices and a slowdown in discretionary spending.
However, the success of the monsoon season could bolster sentiment ahead of Diwali season and throw positive surprises.” India’s overall gold demand could be in the range of 650-750 tonnes in 2023 if prices continue to hold at the current level, he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/india-gold-demand-april-june-qtr-drop-record-high-prices-wgc-8870739/,business

Still, the reading marked over two years of the index being above the 50-mark, which separates expansion from contraction.
“The … sector has maintained its position as one of the star performers globally, bucking the trend of demand weakness seen in other parts of the world,” noted Andrew Harker, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“The Indian manufacturing sector showed little sign of losing growth momentum in July as production lines continued to motor on the back of strong new order growth.”
New orders remained robust in July, and while output growth moderated to a three-month low it remained strong.

Foreign demand stoked exports at the fastest pace since November. Firms expected activity to stay elevated over the coming year and the future output sub-index remained high at 65.3, albeit slightly lower than in June.
That optimism encouraged firms to hire more workers last month.
“Pressure continued to come on capacity, prompting firms to expand employment solidly again, a trend that is likely to continue in the months ahead should demand remain strong,” added Harker.

Additionally, the company is in talks with various international suppliers for more term deals as India seeks to secure long-term LNG supplies in a market prone to volatility.
“We are hopeful that we will be getting definitely a better deal than the others. That is our expectation,” Petronet LNG’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) A.K. Singh said, adding that renegotiation talks have started and are moving in a “positive direction”. Singh, however, declined to share specifics of the pricing levels being sought by the company.
According to him, there are indications that recent contracts by Qatar have been finalised at a slope of 12-13% to the price of Brent crude.
ADVERTISEMENT
As part of the current term deal with Qatar that ends in 2028, Petronet LNG imports 8.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, or super-cooled gas, at a slope of 12.67 per cent to the price of Brent plus an additional charge of $0.52 per million British thermal units. Apart from extending the Qatar contract at a lower price, the company is also understood to be looking at increasing the import volumes by up to 1 mtpa. Petronet’s Qatar LNG contract is India’s biggest term contract for super-cooled gas.
According to Singh, the extreme price volatility that was seen over the past couple of years in global LNG markets has established that term contracts, and not spot purchases, are the most viable option for securing supplies at a reasonable price. He said that increasing gas consumption on a sustainable basis through spot purchases is not a viable option. Therefore, Petronet LNG is in talks with other global suppliers for more term contracts.
As one of the major importers of LNG globally, India was adversely impacted by the tightening global supply and surging spot LNG prices last year in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. India’s oil and gas companies, public sector players in particular, are scouting for long-term LNG purchase agreements with global suppliers to secure reliable supplies of super-cooled gas. Recently, Indian Oil corporation inked term deals with Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC Gas and France’s TotalEnergies for importing 1.2 mtpa and 0.8 mtpa of LNG, respectively.
“We are actively engaged with various suppliers across the globe. It is not only the one supplier and when we are able to finalise the deal, we will definitely share with you. There are opportunities available…and we are actively engaged,” Singh said.

India depends on imports to meet about half of its natural gas requirement. India, like many other countries, views natural gas as a key transition fuel as it makes efforts to accelerate its move to green energy. The Narendra Modi government has set an aim to increase the share of natural gas in India’s primary energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from a little over 6 per cent at present. This means that India’s natural gas demand is likely to grow considerably over the next few years, which in turn means that the requirement of imported LNG is also slated to rise.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/petronet-expects-lower-price-in-qatar-lng-contract-renewal-eyes-more-term-deals-8870087/,business

The report also said that the RBI is reviewing whether the stakes held by Kotak Mahindra Bank in wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries pose any risks.
According to an earlier media report, the bank has engaged an executive search firm for finding the successor, and KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram were among the internal candidates in the fray.

The increasing demand has given an impetus to domestic manufacturing, thereby lowering import dependency and sharply bringing down costs.
According to latest data from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Ministry of Power, inverter ACs accounted for less than 1 per cent of the overall room AC (RAC) market of 4.7 million units in the financial year 2015-16 (FY16). As of FY23, the share has increased to 77 per cent, while the fixed-speed RACs went down to 23 per cent.

Chandrasekhar also said that apart from manufacturing, the government is also focusing on increasing chip design capabilities domestically, with a view to create Indian-owned intellectual property. To that end, he is considering expanding the ambit of the current design-linked incentive scheme to bigger companies— both domestic and foreign.
“We are envisaging that if there is a big Indian or big foreign company that wants to do chip design in India, we should allow the future design scheme to support them too,” he said.

Stating that the government is focused on green growth and becoming energy independent by 2047, Sitharaman said India aims to achieve net zero by 2070, but cannot achieve the goal unless each sector and industry contributes towards it.
“We are in favour of India becoming a manufacturing hub and we will consider the PLI scheme also for the chemicals and petrochemicals sector,” she said at FICCI’s Global Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturing Hubs in India Summit.

In view of stringent pollution control regulations and rising labour cost, she said global manufacturers in the chemical industry are looking at diversifying their products and production capability and India stands out as an alternative destination for manufacturing. “If viable options exist, it exists in such markets where there is a domestic buffer and beyond which there is an export potential. So that is where the government’s policies have been facilitating,” she said.
The Finance Minister said the industry has great potential and should create manufacturing capacity keeping in mind sustainability, carbon emission, general pollution and groundwater pollution, among other issues. “We should remember that India has set its sights on becoming energy independent by 2047 and achieving net zero by 2070. So net zero cannot be achieved unless each industry and each sector contributes to it. We are very focused on green growth. Carbon intensity has to be reduced and therefore each one of the sectors will have to contribute to this,” she said.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy commitments of India are also very important, she said. She also asked the industry to keep the hydrogen mission in mind. The government has approved a Rs 19,744-crore incentive plan to promote the manufacturing of green hydrogen in the country in a bid to cut emissions. The National Green Hydrogen Mission seeks to promote development of green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 million metric tonnes per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.

It will buy at a fair price (adjusted for liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk) but not at distress price, Sebi said. The sellers of debt securities shall be paid 90 per cent of the consideration in cash and 10 per cent in terms of units of CDMDF.
Sebi said CDMDF will be launched as a close-ended scheme with an initial tenure of 15 years (extendable) from the date of its initial closing, that is, the date on which contribution from all AMCs and specified schemes is received by CDMDF, extendable at the discretion of the DEA in consultation with Sebi.

AMCs will make a one-time contribution equivalent to two bps of the AUM of specified debt-oriented mutual fund schemes managed by them, the regulator said. AMCs of new mutual funds will also make a one-time contribution equivalent to two bps of their specified debt-oriented MF schemes, based on the AUM at the end of the financial year following the one in which the specified schemes are launched.

Stating that the government is focused on green growth and becoming energy independent by 2047, Sitharaman said India aims to achieve net zero by 2070, but cannot achieve the goal unless each sector and industry contributes towards it.
“We are in favour of India becoming a manufacturing hub and we will consider the PLI scheme also for the chemicals and petrochemicals sector,” she said at FICCI’s Global Chemicals and Petrochemicals Manufacturing Hubs in India Summit.

In view of stringent pollution control regulations and rising labour cost, she said global manufacturers in the chemical industry are looking at diversifying their products and production capability and India stands out as an alternative destination for manufacturing. “If viable options exist, it exists in such markets where there is a domestic buffer and beyond which there is an export potential. So that is where the government’s policies have been facilitating,” she said.
The Finance Minister said the industry has great potential and should create manufacturing capacity keeping in mind sustainability, carbon emission, general pollution and groundwater pollution, among other issues. “We should remember that India has set its sights on becoming energy independent by 2047 and achieving net zero by 2070. So net zero cannot be achieved unless each industry and each sector contributes to it. We are very focused on green growth. Carbon intensity has to be reduced and therefore each one of the sectors will have to contribute to this,” she said.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy commitments of India are also very important, she said, adding that private companies should keep in mind India’s net zero goal and 500 gigawatts of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources.
She also asked the industry to keep the hydrogen mission in mind. The government has approved a Rs 19,744-crore incentive plan to promote the manufacturing of green hydrogen in the country in a bid to cut emissions. The National Green Hydrogen Mission seeks to promote development of green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 million metric tonnes per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.

Govt to consider PLI scheme for chemicals and petrochem sectors: Sitharaman,ECB President Christine Lagarde had all but promised the quarter-percentage point increase.,"The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the ninth straight time in its yearlong campaign to stamp out painfully high inflation, even as worries about recession fuel speculation that Thursday’s hike could be its last.
ECB President Christine Lagarde had all but promised the quarter-percentage point increase. That puts the focus at her post-meeting news conference on whether the bank will raise rates again at its September meeting or hold off after a record series of rate hikes.
Central banks around the world have been raising borrowing costs to combat inflation unleashed by higher energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine and supply chain backups as the global economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.

European Central Bank hikes interest rates for ninth time to combat inflation,"India is likely to grow 6-6.3 per cent in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Deloitte India said in its economic outlook, forecasting growth surpassing 7 per cent over the next two years if global uncertainties recede.","India is likely to grow 6-6.3 per cent in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Deloitte India said in its economic outlook, forecasting growth surpassing 7 per cent over the next two years if global uncertainties recede.
With the probability associated with a recession in major industrial countries this year trimming, several economic indicators such as the tight labour markets and reduced risk spreads post the US banking crisis suggest that downside risks to global growth are subsiding.
Yet, there remain significant uncertainties around the actions of the central banks of major economies and the oil price movements, the economic outlook said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Amid continuing global uncertainties, India continues to see strong economic activity,” it said. “Keeping in view the resilience shown by the economy, Deloitte is optimistic about the outlook and has put out its expectation for this year and the next. Deloitte expects India to grow between 6 per cent and 6.3 per cent in FY 2023–24, and have a stronger outlook thereafter.” If global uncertainties recede, growth is expected to surpass 7 per cent over the next two years, it said.
“India enjoys a Goldilocks moment currently. Our growth forecasts for FY 2023-24 remain similar to our April forecast, except that higher-than-expected growth in FY2022-23 has raised our base for comparison. That said, we have raised our lower limit of the range given the buoyancy in the economy,” said Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India.
Urban demand conditions have remained resilient as evidenced by the sales of mid-to-high-end segments of automobiles, the number of UPI transactions, and domestic air passenger traffic data. Rural demand, which was lagging, has also been rising lately as seen in the sales of tractors, IIP non-durable goods, and MGNREGA data.
Investment is also showing traction. The credit-deposit ratio has continued to improve strongly from the lows of the pandemic despite the rising interest rates. “Most of the lending is happening in the industry and services sector. This points to improving investment, which means that the supply side is gearing up to meet the rising demand,” Majumdar added.

Inflation in the first quarter was 4.5 per cent, the lowest since the quarter of September 2019. GST collections remain strong, suggesting that revenue buoyancy will aid in improving the budgeted fiscal deficit ratio to GDP.
Among the global risks, Deloitte’s economic outlook highlights the significance and future implications of the monetary policies pursued in the West.
Referring as the salsa of the Central Banks, the changes in the policy rates between the three major central banks – the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England (BoE) – have been by 1390 basis points within a span of 18 months.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Yet, these countries have not been able to tame inflation. The 12-month average inflation after the first policy rate hike is significantly higher than the 12-month average inflation prior to the hike in these countries. Comparatively, India has had better success in taming inflation with relatively lesser policy tightening,” it said.
Rather, an aggressive monetary policy tightening has tightened liquidity conditions too quickly in countries that had ultra-loose monetary policies for over a decade. Since these countries also host a large share of global investors, such an aggressive measure has unnerved the sentiments, leading to capital outflows from emerging countries.
Deloitte does not expect these countries to ease policy rates soon as well. “The headline inflation levels remain above the central bank’s target level of 2 per cent. Clearly, Atras (step backwards) seems unlikely for these Central banks. But Adelante (step forward) may also be challenging,” said Majumdar.
The pressure on US banks, moderating housing demand, and the recent resolution of the debt-ceiling crisis will discourage the US Federal Reserve to raise policy rates for very long.
Among domestic risks, inflation is topmost. The risk of El-Nino and a below-normal monsoon can bring back the pressure on food prices. “We expect the fall in consumer prices to be short-lived as demand picks up along with food prices and the uncertainties around prices remain high. A quicker rebound in the supply side will be of utmost importance for keeping prices under check in the long run,” Majumdar added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-gdp-growth-fy24-economic-prospects-brighten-deloitte-india-8863424/,business

"India’s oil imports set to hit 8-month low in July as rains, refinery maintenance affect demand","The US economy likely maintained a moderate pace of growth in the second quarter as labor market resilience underpinned consumer spending, while businesses boosted investment in equipment and built more factories, potentially keeping a much-feared recession at bay.","The U.S. economy likely maintained a moderate pace of growth in the second quarter as labor market resilience underpinned consumer spending, while businesses boosted investment in equipment and built more factories, potentially keeping a much-feared recession at bay.
The Commerce Department’s snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday is also expected to show the housing market slump nearing an end. Outside the housing market and manufacturing, the economy has largely weathered the 525 basis points in interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 as the U.S. central bank battled inflation.
Economists have since late 2022 been forecasting a downturn, but with price pressures retreating, some now believe that the soft-landing scenario for the economy envisaged by the Fed is feasible. The central bank on Wednesday raised its policy by 25 basis points to a 5.25%-5.50% range.

“This will be another indication that the economy is not tipping into recession. Much of the effect of the rate hikes already has occurred,” said Dean Maki, the chief economist at Point72 Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. “As long as the Fed is content that inflation is moderating at a fast enough pace, they’re not going to implement the kind of additional rate hikes that would be needed to bring about a recession.”
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely increased at a 1.8% annualized rate last quarter after rising at a 2.0% pace in the first quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, likely remained a pillar of support, although the pace of growth slowed from the second quarter’s robust 4.2% rate. Spending on long-lasting manufactured goods has slowed after booming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Services spending is, however, taking up some of the slack.
Spending is being propped up by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, estimated by economists to be as much as $2.1 trillion at one point, debt and strong wage gains from the tight labor market as companies hoard workers after struggling to find labor during the pandemic. That is underscored by persistently low levels of layoffs.

The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday is likely to show first-time applications for state unemployment benefits rising 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended July 22, according to a Reuters poll.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, is seen falling to 1.750 million during the week ending July 15 from 1.754 million in the prior week. This covered the week that the government surveyed households for July’s unemployment rate. At 3.6% in June, the jobless rate was not too far from multi-decade lows.
“There are some pockets of job losses being announced here and there, but it does appear that people are getting jobs rather quickly if they are losing their jobs,” said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
FACTORY CONSTRUCTION BOOMING
ADVERTISEMENT
Business investment likely accelerated after almost stalling in the first quarter, thanks to an anticipated rebound in spending on equipment like aircraft and motor vehicles.
Efforts by President Joe Biden’s administration to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States are boosting factory construction. Investment in nonresidential structures like factories probably remained robust last quarter, contributing to the economy’s resilience.
Further contribution to GDP growth was expected from government spending. Trade was likely a drag after adding to growth for four straight quarters.
Inventory investment is a wild card, though most economists are penciling in a contribution to GDP growth of at least five tenths of a percentage point. Business sharply reduced inventory accumulation in the January-March quarter in anticipation of weaker domestic demand, slicing 2.14 percentage points off GDP growth that period.
Though residential investment, which includes homebuilding, likely contracted for the ninth straight quarter, the decline was probably the shallowest in 1-1/2 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the past, when the economy was heading into recession, homebuilding and auto production plunged. But these cyclical parts of the economy, including new home sales and auto sales are picking up, raising cautious optimism that the economy could skirt a recession, even as some analysts expected GDP to turn negative at some point.
“We’ll see some slowing in the second half of the year, and possibly negative GDP in the first quarter,” said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Forecasting. “But will it rise to the level of a recession? That’s less clear.”
But some economists remain convinced that a recession is on the horizon, arguing that higher borrowing costs will eventually make it harder for consumers to fund their spending with debt.

They also noted that banks were tightening credit and excess savings continued to be run down. Slowing job growth was seen curbing wage gains.
“What we’ve been used to in the last couple of downturns is that everything kind of turns down at the same time,” said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair in London.

Moderate US economic growth expected in second quarter,"The hike, the Fed's 11th in its last 12 meetings, set the benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, a level last seen just prior to the 2007 housing market crash and which has not been consistently exceeded on an effective basis for about 22 years.","The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, citing still elevated inflation as a rationale for what is now the highest U.S. central bank policy rate since 2007.
The hike, the Fed’s 11th in its last 12 meetings, set the benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, a level last seen just prior to the 2007 housing market crash and which has not been consistently exceeded on an effective basis for about 22 years.
“The (Federal Open Market) Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,” the Fed said in language that was little changed from its June statement and left the central bank’s policy options open as it searches for a stopping point to the current tightening cycle.
ADVERTISEMENT
As it stated in June, the Fed said it would watch incoming data and study the impact of its rate hikes on the economy “in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate” to reach its 2% inflation target.
Though inflation data since the Fed’s June 13-14 meeting has been weaker than expected, policymakers have been
reluctant to alter their hawkish stance until there is more progress in reducing price pressures.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said any future policy decisions would be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis and that in the current environment, officials can only provide limited guidance about what’s next for monetary policy.
ADVERTISEMENT
But he didn’t rule out action if it was deemed necessary.
“It is certainly possible that we would raise the (federal) funds rate again at the September meeting if the data warranted, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting” if that was the right policy call, Powell said in a press conference after the release of the policy statement.
But Powell cautioned against expecting any near-term easing in rates. “We’ll be comfortable cutting rates when we’re comfortable cutting rates and that won’t be this year,” Powell said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Yields on both the two- and 10-year Treasury notes moved down modestly from levels right before the release of the Fed’s policy statement, while U.S. stocks ended mixed. Futures markets showed bets on the path of Fed rate increases over the remainder of the year were little changed, seeing small odds of a rise in September.
“The forward guidance remains unchanged as the committee leaves the door open to further rate hikes if inflation does not continue to trend lower,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. “Our view is the Fed is likely done with rate hikes for this cycle since continued easing of inflation will passively lead to tighter policy as the Fed holds the nominal fed funds rate steady into 2024.”
‘MODERATE’ GROWTH
Key measures of inflation remain more than double the Fed’s target, and the economy by many measures, including a low 3.6% unemployment rate, continues to outperform expectations given the rapid increase in interest rates.
Job gains remain “robust,” the Fed said, while it described the economy as growing at a “moderate” pace, a slight upgrade from the “modest” pace seen as of the June meeting. The U.S. government on Thursday is expected to report the economy grew at a 1.8% annual pace in the second quarter, according to economists polled by Reuters.
Powell said he’s still holding out hope the economy can achieve a ‘soft landing,’ a scenario in which inflation falls, unemployment remains relatively low and a recession is avoided.
ADVERTISEMENT
“My base case is we’ll be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses,” he said, while noting that outlook is “a long way from assured.” He also noted that Fed staff economists are no longer predicting a recession as they have at recent meetings.
With about eight weeks until the next Fed meeting, a longer-than-usual interlude, continued moderation in the pace of price increases could make this the last rate hike in a process that began with a cautious quarter-percentage-point increase in March of 2022 before accelerating into the most rapid monetary tightening since the 1980s.

The joint venture will launch a “digital-first” offering following regulatory approvals, said the statement, without giving a timeline within which it plans to begin operations. The venture is BlackRock’s second attempt at an entry into India’s asset management industry. It exited an earlier joint venture with local financial firm DSP Group in 2018.

The Income Tax Department has urged taxpayers to file their returns at the earliest to avoid last-minute rush and late penalties.
As of now, the Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT) has not indicated or made any announcement of an extension of the last date for filing ITR. Thus, it is most likely that the deadline to file an ITR for FY2023, or assessment year (AY) 2023-24, will end on July 31.
On Monday, CBDT chairperson Nitin Gupta said that over four crore income tax returns (ITRs) for FY23 have been filed so far, and of these, around 7 per cent are new or first-time filers. Gupta, while speaking on the occasion of Income Tax Day, further said that over half of these ITRs have been processed, and around 80 lakh refunds have been issued.

What will happen if you miss the last date for filing ITR?
Although it is not advisable that one should miss their ITR, if someone misses filing their income tax return before deadline, they can file a belated ITR, which includes a late filing penalty.
What is belated ITR?
In case taxpayers are filing belated ITR, they have to pay a fee of Rs 5,000, which is levied under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, for individuals, whose total income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh in a fiscal year, the maximum penalty for filing a belated ITR is Rs 1,000.
Moreover, if taxpayers have to pay tax in their ITR, they will be charged an interest of 1 per cent per month from the due date till they file their return.

The Indian government on July 20 had banned the export of non-basmati white rice to boost domestic supply and keep retail prices under check during the upcoming festive season. This type of rice constitutes about 25 per cent of total rice exported from the country.
There would be no change in export policy of par-boiled non-basmati rice and basmati rice, which forms the bulk of exports, the food ministry had said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the current environment, these types of restrictions are likely to exacerbate volatility on food prices in the rest of the world. They can also lead to retaliatory measures, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund (IMF), told a press conference here.
“So, they are certainly something that we would encourage the removal of these types of export restrictions, because they can be harmful globally,” he said in response to a question.
The total exports of non-basmati white rice from India was USD 4.2 million in 2022-23 as against USD 2.62 million in the preceding year. Major destinations of India’s non-basmati white rice exports include the US, Thailand, Italy, Spain and Sri Lanka.
In order to ensure adequate availability of non-basmati white rice in the domestic market and to allay the rise in local prices, the government has amended the export policy from ‘Free with export duty of 20%’ to ‘Prohibited’ with immediate effect. The IMF in its latest economic update released here on Tuesday projected India’s growth rate to be 6.1 per cent for fiscal year 2024, which is slightly up from 5.9 per cent estimated projection for the same period in April.

“India remains an economy that is growing quite strongly. I mean, it’s coming down from really a very strong year in 2022, at 7.2 per cent. That was also revised upwards, by the way — but still slow down, but still fairly strong growth and fairly strong momentum,” Gourinchas said.
Later in an interview, when asked about India’s rice export ban, Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, IMF Research Department, told PTI that the context is clearly, an environment of declining inflation around the world.
“That’s important because then it allows monetary policy to ease up and not to start increasing interest rates, which means currencies move around,” he said.

“We see it in the interest of the overall global community to keep that food and energy inflation trend down. Now the challenge is that if we see restrictions in other countries as well as India, we’ve been very clear that in our view we understand the domestic consideration, but if you see that global impact, then that would go against the reduction in inflation. So our perspective is that such restrictions should be phased out as soon as feasible,” Leigh said.
He also said that India’s digital public infrastructure is really world class and it is enabling efficiency gains for businesses.
“Really what is great to see is India sharing its experience with the other members of the G20. Under its presidency of the G20, India is helping to spread the understanding and the opportunities and the risks that we need to talk about when it digitises more generally,” he said.
The Indian economy, Leigh said, has already been very robust. “But the reforms when it comes to female labour force participation to make it easier for women to stay in the workforce, for the youth to find the kind of training that they need. This is a very dynamic economy. The question is how to maximize the potential,” he said.
“India’s economy is growing strongly and also inflation is in the range of the central bank target. So those are positive things and the growth forecast itself is for growth of 6.1 per cent this year. This means that basically 16 per cent of the world economy, one in six of the world’s economic growth is coming from India,” he said, Referring to the upward revision of the Indian growth projections, Leigh said this is mainly because of what happened at the end of last year. More government investment, more private investment, give it the economy boost and that has a knock on effect for this year, he said.

“Now we do see growth continuing to be above six next year as well, 6.3 per cent and in the medium term about six per cent. This is the kind of above average growth for the region that is really going to help economic well being,” Leigh said.
Noting that the IMF expects India’s inflation to be at 4.9 per cent and then 4.5 per cent next year, he said the monetary policy action really deserves a lot of the credit for this 250 basis point increase in the interest rate since May of last year. “There’s also though the fortunate decline that all of the countries are benefiting from in food and energy prices globally. This is also driving inflation down,” Leigh said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/non-basmati-white-rice-imf-india-remove-export-restrictions-8860981/,business

While Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) invested USD 1.3 billion for a 2.04 per cent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) put in Rs 5,513 crore for a 1.2 per cent stake. The UAE’s Mubadala invested Rs 6,248 crore for a 1.4 per cent stake.
The three were part of an array of global investors who poured in Rs 47,265 crore in a span of two months to buy 10.09 per cent in Reliance Retail. Others include New York-based private equity firm KKR, Silver Lake Partners, General Atlantic, GIC and TPG.
When contacted, a Reliance Retail spokesperson said, “The company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. As a principle, we do not comment on market speculations and rumours.” Earlier this month, the company reportedly hired two global consultants who valued RRVL between USD 92-96 billion.

Reliance Retail, the nation’s top retailer that spans luxury fashion to groceries, has been aggressively expanding its business by acquiring companies and getting the franchise rights of leading international brands for the Indian market.
In 2020, RRVL had raised Rs 47,265 crore (around USD 6.4 billion) from global private equity funds for a 10.09 per cent stake, valuing the company at more than Rs 4.2 lakh crore.

Commenting on talks with Qatar’s wealth fund, JP Morgan said the discussions highlight the multiple stake sale optionality that exists across Reliance’s multiple businesses.
“For Reliance to double its value over the next four years (comments in last year’s annual shareholder meeting), this would involve value unlocking from the substantial investments the company has made across segments (retail, Jio) and would make (New Energy),” it said adding it would also require selling stakes/listings of some of these businesses.
Over the years, Reliance has sold strategic stakes in its oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) business, financial stakes in retail, and large stake sales to multiple investors in telecom arm Jio.
For its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, while Reliance had signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia for a stake sale, the transaction did not progress.
Reliance has not sold any stake in its newer businesses like New Energy. The firm has also built a real estate portfolio.

This upward revision marks a reversal of the IMF’s April decision, when it had cut the growth forecast from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent.
“Growth in India is projected at 6.1% in 2023, a 0.2 percentage point upward revision compared with the April projection, reflecting momentum from stronger-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 (FY23) as a result of stronger domestic investment,” IMF said.
For the calendar year 2023, the growth projection for the country is 6.6 per cent, it said.

In the latest update of its World Economic Outlook, the IMF also raised its baseline forecast for world growth in the year to 3 per cent from 2.8 per cent forecast in April. This came amid reduced chances of a recession in the US, where inflation fell to 3 per cent in June, in what could likely make the expected Fed rate rise today the last in the cycle. The world’s largest economy, as per the IMF, will likely grow 1.8 per cent in calendar year 2023, up 0.2 bps from April estimate.

Last week, the Asian Development Bank retained India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year at 6.4 per cent, citing a recovery in consumption demand in both rural and urban areas, but cautioned that subdued exports due to the global slowdown will be a drag. On June 22, global rating agency Fitch had also raised its India GDP growth forecast to 6.3 per cent from 6 per cent predicted in March. With a stronger-than-expected rate of expansion of 6.1 per cent in January-March, the FY23 GDP growth came in at 7.2 per cent, compared with the advance estimate of 7 per cent.
The global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the IMF said. In the near term, the signs of progress are undeniable, it said. The latest prediction of 3 per cent growth in world GDP in 2023, however, is still a slowdown from the 3.5 per cent growth reported last year.

“The recent resolution of the US debt ceiling standoff and, earlier this year, strong action by authorities to contain turbulence in US and Swiss banking, reduced the immediate risks of financial sector turmoil,” the IMF said. “This moderated adverse risks to the outlook.”

The IMF, however, sees continued risks to financial stability amid higher rates, a slower-than-expected recovery in China, debt distress in emerging economies and threats to trade from geo-economic fragmentation. The IMF said global inflation is projected to decline from 8.7 per cent last year to 6.8 per cent this year, a 0.2 percentage point downward revision and be 5.2 per cent in 2024.
“Inflation remains high and continues to erode household purchasing power. Policy tightening by central banks in response to inflation has raised the cost of borrowing, constraining economic activity. Immediate concerns about the health of the banking sector have subsided, but high interest rates are filtering through the financial system, and banks in advanced economies have significantly tightened lending standards, curtailing the supply of credit,” the IMF said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/imf-projects-indian-economy-to-grow-at-6-1-per-cent-in-2023-8860049/,business
IMF raises India growth forecast for FY24 to 6.1%,Kapoor has been in jail since March 2020 in connection with the DHFL money laundering case.,"Sebi on Tuesday sent a notice to Yes Bank’s former MD and CEO Rana Kapoor, asking him to pay Rs 2.22 crore in a case of mis-selling the private sector lender’s AT1 bonds and warned of arrest and attachment of assets as well as bank accounts if he fails to make the payment within 15 days.
Kapoor has been in jail since March 2020 in connection with the DHFL money laundering case.
The demand notice came after Kapoor failed to pay the fine imposed on him by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in September 2022. In a notice, Sebi directed Kapoor to pay Rs 2.22 crore, which includes interest and recovery costs, within 15 days. In the event of non-payment of dues, the market regulator will recover the amount by attaching and selling his moveable and immovable property.

Besides, Kapoor faces attachment of his bank accounts and arrest.
In September 2022, the regulator imposed a penalty of Rs 2 crore on Kapoor in the matter. The case relates to mis-selling of the bank’s AT1 (Additional Tier-1) bonds to retail investors by the bank’s officials. It was alleged that the bank and certain officials did not inform investors of the risk involved while selling the AT-1 bonds in the secondary market. The sale of AT1 bonds started in 2016 and continued till 2019.
In its order, Sebi stated that Kapoor was overseeing the entire operation relating to the secondary sale of AT-1 bonds, taking regular updates from the team and giving them further instructions to increase the sales, thus creating pressure on the officials to ramp up the sales.
Further, the regulator stated that Kapoor was responsible for acts of misrepresentation or suppression of material facts, manipulation and mis-spelling of AT-1 bonds of Yes Bank to individual investors. Also, Kapoor pressured officials of the private wealth management team to devise a devious scheme to dump the AT-1 bonds on hapless customers of Yes Bank.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-issues-rs-2-cr-demand-notice-to-yes-banks-former-md-rana-kapoor-8860051/,business

Market experts attribute the reasons for the rise in stock prices to an increase in interest from domestic investors.
“Definitely, there is significant interest from investors like retail, HNIs and family offices. Also, the market is catching up with the fundamentals of the Adani Group companies.

The news broadcaster NDTV hit the upper circuit limit, closing at Rs 238.75, marking a gain of 4.99 per cent.
The recent surge in Adani Group’s market value reflects the various investor confidence-building measures implemented by the conglomerate in the wake of the Hindenburg report, which has resulted in the group’s market value recovering to over Rs 10.6 lakh crore from its post-Hindenburg lows of Rs 6.5 lakh crore.
ADVERTISEMENT
US short-seller Hindenburg Research in January released a damning report alleging accounting fraud and stock price manipulation at Adani Group, triggering a stock market rout that had erased about USD 145 billion in the conglomerate’s market value at its lowest point.
Adani Group has denied all allegations by Hindenburg and is plotting a comeback strategy that includes recasting its ambitions, scrapping acquisitions, pre-paying debt to address concerns about its cash flows and borrowings, and scaling back its pace of spending on new projects.
US-based investment firm GQG Partners invested in Adani Group companies in three tranches over the last five months. GQG had initially invested USD 1.87 billion in four group companies in March and followed by open market purchases of about USD 500 million in May. GQG bought another USD 1 billion worth of stocks in several Adani Group companies in late June.
These strategic investments by GQG Partners align with the Adani family’s strategy to reassure investors of their commitment to growth and exemplify GQG’s confidence in the group’s robust business model, despite the past Hindenburg crisis.

Once the initiative is launched, Indians will soon be able to shop for clothes that would fit them better. Presently, international and domestic brands available in India use measurements from the US or the UK for garments, having ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’ sizes.
However, Western body types differ from Indians in terms of height, weight or specific measurements of body parts, which sometimes causes fitting issues.

“We are hoping… that will happen very soon,” Shah told PTI when asked about the rollout of the INDIAsize initiative.
The Textiles Secretary said the government’s goal is to take the domestic technical textiles segment to USD 40-50 billion in the next five years or so, from USD 22 billion at present.
“Our exports of technical textiles is presently at USD 2.5 billion, our objective is to enhance it to USD 10 billion during this period,” Shah added.
The technical textile market globally is to the tune of about USD 250-260 billion and is expected to increase to about USD 320-325 billion by 2025-26, she said.

The Textiles Secretary shared that the government is working in the technical textiles sector with a multi-pronged approach.
“There is focus on R&D activity in the technical textile segment including fibre and in development of various applications. There is also focus on developing a skilling ecosystem and skilled manpower for this sector.
“The government is promoting investment in technical textiles through its flagship schemes namely the PLI scheme for textiles as also the PM-MITRA Mega Textiles Parks,” Shah said.

She informed that the Textiles Ministry is working very closely with various user Ministries and Departments within the government and state governments to increase demand and increase the penetration of technical textiles.
One very critical element of the approach is focusing on developing standards and regulations for technical textiles, she said while addressing a Ficci conference.
The Ministry of Textiles sanctioned the INDIAsize project to develop standard body sizes for the Indian apparel sector to address the prevailing disparities and inconsistencies in provided fits.
The project entails gathering anthropometric data pan-India from more than 25,000 male and female persons between the age group of 15 years and 65 years using human safe 3D whole-body scanning technology.
The created body-size chart will help national and international retailers and manufacturers to produce goods which are best suited for Indian body types and create a balance between demand and supply of well fitted garments.

Western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the $60 a barrel price cap on Russian crude exports and the European Union’s import ban, have forced the Kremlin to change the way it taxes oil sales.
Russian President Vladimir Putin in February signed a law fixing the discount on Russia’s dominant Urals blend of crude oil for tax calculations.

"Over 4 cr I-T returns filed so far in FY24, 7% new filers: CBDT","She assured taxpayers that the CBDT and the field formations are conscious that they are working towards a transparent, responsible, objective and taxpayer friendly regime where very clearly the targets are before them.","Stating that it is not a “fishing expedition”, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said over 1,00,000 income tax notices sent to taxpayers based on understatement of income or non-filing of taxes will be wrapped up by March 2024. While pointing towards the “lingering memory” of discretion used by a few income tax officials, Sitharaman stressed on the importance of perception of the tax department and asked officials to introspect on their behaviour with assessees, and at the same time assured taxpayers of a transparent, responsible, objective and taxpayer-friendly regime.
Speaking at the 164th Income Tax Day celebrations at Delhi, Sitharaman said for India to reach the goal to become a developed nation by 2047, the country will have to keep the growth momentum and a widening of the tax net would be required through a “nudge”, campaigns or through levies like TDS/TCS (Tax Deducted at Source/Tax Collected at Source) which “track and trace” and are not additional tax levies.
The Finance Minister said assessments are being reopened only till six years and within this timeframe also, cases have been reopened and notices have been sent after fourth year and before sixth year based on two categories — where information is available that the income has been understated, or where there are non-filers and information is they should have been filers.
ADVERTISEMENT
“About 1,00,000 notices were sent…these are not just being thoughtlessly sent…by March 2024, this entire 1 lakh will be cleared. That set of notices which have been issued based on the information that we have for those whose incomes are more than Rs 50 lakh, the notices and the treatment or assessment will all be completed by March 2024. Post which every year 4th and 6th year, notices will continue. The process will be now rather more predictable…it is no longer a fishing expedition.”
Sitharaman further said that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in May 2023 completed scrutiny assessment of the 55,000 notices which had been sent pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling. “The Board today is not sitting over notices which have been issued and ….it is not a place of discretion, it is not a place where people are gaming the system… there is a clear cut approach,” Sitharaman added.
The government has not hiked income tax rates yet tax revenues are increasing due to the efficiency of the Income Tax Department, she said. “No rate hike but hand holding and supporting assessees wherever required… we are looking at assessees as wealth creators,” she added.
She assured taxpayers that the CBDT and the field formations are conscious that they are working towards a transparent, responsible, objective and taxpayer friendly regime where very clearly the targets are before them. She said all can work together towards widening the tax net and having a friendly tax regime.

“Even today, widening (the tax net) is an issue we are talking about. What will work? Nudge will work, campaigns will work…that’s why TDS and TCS are always talked about, they are not new additional taxes, just track and trace. Therefore, there is a need for all of us to look at the Indian economy and see how best we can contribute towards building a developed India by 2047,” she said.
Pointing out that it’s always the perception which matters, Sitharaman said though the department has become tech-savvy, a certain perception of discretion remains which the tax department needs to work upon as they are the face of the government while dealing with tax assessees.
“In this 164th year, it wouldn’t be at all late or it wouldn’t be too early to tell ourselves what is the perception about us. We are very efficient, we are tech savvy, we are very dedicated to our jobs, we have shown performance even as the economy is reviving post-Covid…faceless technology has fitted in well, it has brought transparency but it is taking time for the perception to also change that much…but even today there is a lingering memory of a few who had used discretion, a few I repeat, as a result of which the impression about the department about the way in which it functions, that lingering memory is still there in a few assessees, I won’t say all. I would appeal to all of us…at a time when we are aspiring to be a developed India by 2047… let us ask ourselves how we are perceived?…just ask that question to introspect.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/income-tax-dept-to-wrap-up-over-one-lakh-assessment-notices-by-march-2024-fm-8858356/,business

The world’s most populous country aspires to leapfrog to the status of a developed nation, riding on the unprecedented demographic dividend, which demands an annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of around 8% for the next 25 years.
But reaching this milestone hinges on implementing key reforms in education, infrastructure, healthcare and technology.

“If we want to realize that 8% growth potential this decade…the biggest challenge before policymakers is to reallocate the surplus labour from agriculture to more productive sectors with gainful jobs in them,” said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ Research.
“If India’s reform momentum is lacklustre, a less exciting picture is on the cards.”
The latest Reuters poll of 53 economists taken between July 13 and 21 showed the Indian economy would grow 6.1% this fiscal year, a respectable rate when other major economies are expected to slow, maintaining a conducive environment for job creation.
It was forecast to grow 6.5% next fiscal year, with expectations of 6.2% growth this quarter, followed by 6.0% and 5.5%. The outlook was largely unchanged from a June poll.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I think 6.0% to 6.5% is a very achievable and a very conservative forecast for India’s growth trajectory,” Nim added.
World Bank President Ajay Banga recently said the key to India’s growth story is through more jobs as he outlined the opportunity to cash in on the “China Plus One” strategy, a scheme adopted by many companies to build manufacturing units outside of the People’s Republic.
DEMAND VS SUPPLY
Asked how the employment situation will change over the coming year, 17 of 25 economists said it will improve slightly.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The unemployment situation hasn’t improved yet…and the skilling to some extent is also missing. So, there is a gap in terms of the demand versus the supply,” said Radhika Piplani, chief economist at DAM Capital Advisors.
Asked what impact the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, designed to attract foreign manufacturers to set up factories in India, would have on the country’s GDP this fiscal year, 21 of 27 economists said it will only increase it modestly.
The remaining six said the PLI scheme, which allocated billions of rupees as incentives from the Union budget in 2023-24, will have no impact.
“All the sectors where PLI has started are seen booming, but the actual impact of it to on-the-ground employment – that is still something which is yet to be seen,” Piplani added.
While India has a lot more ground to cover to replace China as the world’s manufacturing hub, some economists acknowledged the PLI scheme was a step in the right direction.

More economic reforms could bolster the scheme’s prospects and create millions of jobs, they added.
“Manufacturing needs to see strong growth and that is possible only when we…iron out the issues that are preventing fresh investments in the sector,” said Suman Chowdhury, chief economist at Acuite Ratings and Research.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/india-economy-top-spot-gdp-not-so-much-jobs-growth-8856928/,business
India’s economy to hold top spot for GDP but not so much for jobs growth: Poll,"Adani, at the company's AGM a few days back, stated, ""Of the several projects underway, two of the key ones include the Navi Mumbai Airport and the Copper Smelter, and both are on schedule"".","Billionaire Gautam Adani-led group’s copper-producing factory at Mundra in Gujarat will start operations from March next year, helping cut India’s dependence on imports and aiding energy transition, sources said.
Copper is known as the “metal of electrification” as deeper electrification requires wires, which are primarily made from copper. Technologies critical to the energy transition like electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaics (PV), wind and batteries, all require copper.
Kutch Copper Ltd (KCL), a subsidiary of the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), is setting up a greenfield copper refinery project for the production of refined copper with 1 million tonnes per annum in two phases.
ADVERTISEMENT
For Phase-1, capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per annum, KCL has achieved financial closure through a syndicated club loan, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The first phase is expected to become operational by the end of the current fiscal, they said.
Adani, at the company’s AGM a few days back, stated, “Of the several projects underway, two of the key ones include the Navi Mumbai Airport and the Copper Smelter, and both are on schedule”.
The Rs 8,783 crore-greenfield project completed a full debt tie-up with a consortium of banks led by SBI earlier this year, they said, adding the entire debt requirement of Rs 6,071 crore for Phase-1 has been provided by the consortium of banks.

The equity for the project has been invested by the parent Adani Enterprises Ltd. In addition, it has got all the major approvals in place to ensure timely execution.
Copper is the third most used industrial metal after steel and aluminium, and its demand is rising on the back of fast-growing renewable energy, telecom and electric vehicle industries.
India’s copper production has been unable to meet this demand, and domestic supply disruptions have led to a higher dependency on imported copper. India’s imports have been consistently on the rise for the past five years.
ADVERTISEMENT
For FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal), India imported a record 1,81,000 tonnes of copper, while exports plummeted to a record low of 30,000 tonnes, even lower than the pandemic period, according to the data from the government.
The country is estimated to have consumed 7,50,000 tonnes of copper in FY23 (612 KT in FY22). The number is expected to rise to 1.7 million tonnes by 2027 on the back of huge demand from the green energy industry.
Global demand for copper from solar photovoltaic (PV) installations alone is estimated to double to 2.25 million tonnes in the current decade.
Adani group, which is rapidly growing its renewable portfolio, will be a significant consumer of the red metal, sources said.
The strategically located plant at Mundra on the west coast will play a crucial part in the green energy infrastructure development, and encourage ‘Make in India’. The project has the potential to make the Mundra Special Economic Zone a hub for downstream ecosystems of value-added copper products going forward.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sources said the location provides the additional advantage of access to lower cost and uninterrupted energy supply and logistical infrastructure to cater to domestic and international demand.
On the operational front, the company is engaged in long-term supply agreements for the key raw material — copper concentrate. This, along with strategic location and integrated value chain advantage, will help Kutch Copper to be one of the most sustainable and lowest-cost copper producers in the world, according to sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
Keeping in mind the group’s ESG priorities, the plant’s sustainable solution-based project design will have zero liquid discharge. It will explore using green power and deploying byproducts for cement and other businesses.
In addition, the plant will be producing 25 tonnes per annum old, 250 tonnes of silver and 1,500 kilotonnes per annum (KTPA) sulphuric acid and 250 KTPA phosphoric acid as byproducts.
ADVERTISEMENT
India imports roughly two million tonnes of sulphuric acid, which is a key raw material for manufacturing phosphatic fertilisers, detergents and speciality chemicals.
Globally, copper production is more concentrated than oil. The two top producers – Chile and Peru – account for 38 per cent of world production.
Demand growth during the energy transition – moving away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy – is projected to be pronounced in the US, China and Europe, besides India. By 2035, the US is projected to import up to two-thirds of its copper needs.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-group-1-billion-copper-project-mudra-march-2024-8856865/,business

The process is in line with procedural requirements under Indian law which allow every creditor a right to payment and remedy by submitting claims if a company is under bankruptcy. Once the claims are filed, the resolution professional has to check its authenticity.
“Claims from the lenders are around 50 billion rupees, while lessors’ claims amount to 180 billion rupees so far,” a banker with a state-run bank, who has exposure to Go Airlines said, after a meeting of the committee of creditors on Friday. The bankers did not wish to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.

Go Airline’s resolution professional has yet to verify the veracity of the claims and did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ email seeking comment.
Go Airlines, which operated the Go First carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection in May blaming “faulty” Pratt & Whitney engines for the grounding of about half its 54 Airbus A320neos.
The Raytheon-owned engine maker has said the claims are without merit. The company earlier this month invited investor interest in the company through a court-appointed administrator. The last date to submit an expression of interest (EoI) is August 9.
“The airline has received 40 queries on EOIs from potential bidders, but no formal submissions have been made as yet,” the second banker said.
India’s aviation regulator on Friday said Go Airlines could resume operations if it can meet certain conditions, including getting interim funding and approval of its flight schedule.

Choubey attributed the recent increase in prices to a combination of factors like “crop seasonality, white fly disease in Kolar (Karnataka), instantaneous arrival of monsoon rains in northern part of the country which adversely affected tomato crops in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and logistics disruptions in isolated areas due to heavy rains.” The minister informed that the average daily retail price of tomato had crossed Rs 150 per kg in Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the week July 10-16.

Releasing the phase-1 report of the ‘Saagu Baagu’ (‘agriculture advancement’ in the Telugu language) being implemented by the Telangana government in collaboration with it, the WEF said its AI for Agriculture Innovation (AI4AI) initiative has helped more than 7,000 chilli farmers get access to agritech services in the first phase.
These agritech services include AI-based advisories, soil testing, produce quality testing and e-commerce — all in the project’s pilot phase.

The state government plans to scale existing and additional agritech services in phase II (from 2023 onwards) to 20,000 chilli and ground nut farmers in three districts. The digital public infrastructure will also be introduced in phase II, while in phase III (by 2025), the target is to reach 1,00,000 farmers in the state.
The project was initiated in 2022 and is being implemented by Digital Green (in consortium with three agritech startups) with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
The WEF said the project report can serve as a playbook for governments to enable their local agritech ecosystem and uplift smallholder farmers.
“As the urgency of the climate crisis becomes more evident and conflicts and natural calamities continue to devastate communities, threatening global food security, the industry is under mounting pressure to embrace sustainable practices and revamp its portfolios.

“Consequently, agriculture has evolved into a dynamic arena with investment opportunities and innovative solutions, making it an attractive domain for tech-savvy and entrepreneurial minds,” the Forum said.
It said the AI4AI initiative aims to transform the agriculture sector in India by promoting the use of AI and other emerging technologies.
While these technologies have the potential to significantly contribute to improving productivity and sustainability, they are often marked by fragmented technological infrastructure, high costs of operations, lack of access to data and limited technical expertise, while hampering the scale of their impact.

“The AI4AI addresses these challenges to scale emerging technologies, and it lies at the heart of the ‘Saagu Baagu’ project,” the WEF said.
The WEF described this project as an example of agriculture value chain transformation by focusing on easing agritech services delivery to the end customer through administrative and policy support and digital public infrastructure, including its ‘Agriculture Data Exchange’ and ‘Agritech Sandbox’.
“Telangana’s experience highlights the need for governments to play an enabling role and consider non-financial yet high-impact areas to help scale agri-tech services. A focus on value chains is also needed to ensure efforts are focused, organised and outcome-oriented,” said Purushottam Kaushik, Head of the WEF’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in India.
“I am thrilled to announce the release of the Saagu Baagu Phase-1 report, highlighting our groundbreaking collaboration with the WEF.

"Centre should partner with foreign govts, form global body on AI regulation: TRAI",The reliance on imported crude in the first quarter (Q1) of the current financial year (FY24) was also higher than the previous fiscal’s 87.4 per cent--the highest-ever for a full year.,"India’s reliance on imported crude inched up to 88.3 per cent in April-June from 86.5 per cent a year ago as consumption of fuels and other petroleum products rose while domestic oil production declined slightly, as per data released by the Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry. The reliance on imported crude in the first quarter (Q1) of the current financial year (FY24) was also higher than the previous fiscal’s 87.4 per cent–the highest-ever for a full year.
While the government wants to reduce India’s high dependency on imported crude oil, sluggish domestic oil output in the face of continually growing domestic demand has been the biggest obstacle. In early 2015, the government had set a target to reduce reliance on oil imports to 67 per cent by 2022 from 77 per cent in 2013-14, but the dependence has only grown. Heavy reliance on imported crude oil makes the Indian economy vulnerable to global oil price volatility, apart from having a bearing on the country’s foreign trade deficit, foreign exchange reserves, rupee’s exchange rate, and inflation.

The country’s second-largest IT services company — which competes with the likes of TCS, Wipro and others — drastically lowered its revenue guidance for the full year to 1 to 3.5 per cent in constant currency, down from 4 to 7 per cent it had projected earlier.

The weak outlook and Q1 scorecard – which reflected microeconomic headwinds and delayed decision-making by clients – drove its US-listed shares down nearly 7 per cent in pre-market trading.
Seen sequentially, its net profit declined 3 per cent over the March quarter, while the revenue rose 1.31 per cent.
“We had good Q1 with large mega deals, but we have seen some of the deal signing and start dates being delayed,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said during an earnings briefing.
Accordingly, the revenue from these mega deals is expected to flow in the later part of the financial year.

“In the short term, we see some clients stopping or slowing down transformation programmes and discretionary work, especially so in financial services, mortgages, asset management, investment banking and payments,” he said.
Through the quarter, Infosys saw volumes in specific industries being impacted, where clients reduced transformational projects and decision-making slowed.
“When we look at volumes of discretionary projects, we see some of them slowing down. We see good traction from generative AI and mega deals,” Parekh said.

In the Q1 results statement, Parekh said that the company had clocked solid Q1 with large deals of USD 2.3 billion, “which helps us to set a strong foundation for future growth”.
“Our generative AI capabilities are expanding well, with 80 active client projects,” he said.
The company has expanded the margin improvement programme with a holistic set of actions for the short, medium and long-term, working on five key areas, supported by a leadership team.
On the company’s recruitment plans, Parekh said that while the company has targets for recruiting for the year, it will keep an eye on “changes in terms of the demand environment” and “attrition numbers”.
On promotions, the company management said that compensations are under active consideration.

The fund raise follows a reverse merger between parent IDFC Ltd and IDFC First Bank announced earlier this month.
IDFC First Bank has board approval to raise 40 billion rupees. It has already raised close to half that amount through a preferential allotment to IDFC Ltd.

The remaining amount of about 20 billion rupees will be raised in the second half, the source, who declined to be identified as discussions are private, said. IDFC First Bank declined to comment.
Shares of the lender have gained 33% so far this year compared to the Nifty banking index, which is up 6.4%.
Over the past three years, IDFC Bank has brought down its bad loans and accelerated deposit accretion to strengthen its fundamentals, allowing it to raise institutional capital with ease, said the source.
“This will help fund the bank’s growth.”
Its deposit base has risen 47% over a year ago to 1.4 trillion rupees as of March 2023, while its loan book of 1.6 trillion, which was weighed down by infrastructure loans, is now heavily weighted in favour of more healthy retail loans.
Gross bad loans have fallen to 1.65% from 4% in March 2021.

IDFC Bank can grow 25% on a compounded annual basis and gain market share, said brokerage house Emkay in report dated July 7.
It is expected to deliver a return on assets (RoA) of 1.3-1.5% and a return on equity of 12-15% over the next three years despite factoring in capital raise, the brokerage house said.

The demerger by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance is considered the oil-to-retail conglomerate’s way of expanding in the lucrative financial services sector, especially as it has a non-bank financial company licence.
In a first, India’s main stock exchanges held a special hour-long “pre-open call auction” trading session for Reliance on Thursday to determine JFS’ share price.

The price was determined as 261.85 rupees, or the difference between 2,841.85 rupees, Reliance’s closing price on Wednesday, and 2,580 rupees, its price at the end of the special session.
JFS’s stock price is higher than analysts’ estimate of 160 rupees to 190 rupees. Stockholders will get one JFS share for each Reliance share they hold.
The stock will be included in major Indian indices, including the benchmark Nifty 50, but will not trade until it is listed, the date for which Reliance will likely set at its upcoming annual general meeting.

A: With the world’s cheapest Domino’s pizza.
The 49-rupee ($0.60) pizza in India, Domino’s No.1 market outside America, is the tip of the spear in its fight against rampant inflation that’s squeezing profits and pricing out many customers, according to the CEO of its franchisee there.
The company wants to “own that price point”, said Sameer Khetarpal, confirming the stripped down, seven-inch cheese pizza with a “sprinkle” of basil and parsley is Domino’s cheapest anywhere.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You are coming to the store or open the app, because there is a 49-rupee callout,” he said, adding that Domino’s global team supported the plans. “Customers are going to eat out less because prices are higher everywhere – our existing consumers should not go out to some competition.”
In Shanghai, by comparison, Domino’s cheapest savoury pizza is priced about $3.80, and in San Francisco about $12, online menu prices show. Domino’s global HQ referred queries about India to its local franchisee.
Reuters interviews with six executives and 12 store managers revealed how Domino’s and other global fast-food giants like Pizza Hut and Burger King are being forced to change tactics to weather rampant inflation in the market of 1.4 billion people.
The companies are striving to hold onto market share gained over three decades of rapid growth in a nation critical to their futures – and one where it’s tough to compete with a street-food culture and a sizzling samosa for as little as 10 rupees.
ADVERTISEMENT
Khetarpal, whose Jubilant FoodWorks runs Domino’s 1,816 outlets in the country, says he holds a staff meeting first thing every Monday to brainstorm new ways to manage costs and fight the “historic high inflation” that contributed to its profits sliding 70% in the first three months of 2023.
He gave new details of Domino’s India pivot and its financial gains; his company has removed lids from all boxes of pizzas sold at stores starting December, saving 0.6 cents each time. He said that amounts to a significant saving in packaging costs because 37% of Domino’s Indian business is dine-in.
Jubilant – whose Domino’s business accounted for most of its $635 million in revenues last year – also aims to secure rent rebates from some store landlords by offering upfront payments, Khetarpal said, declining to give further details about cost benefits.
CUSTOMERS EMPTY POCKETS

Domino’s is not alone in zeroing in on prices in India, a highly price-sensitive market that is currently facing higher inflation than many other markets including the U.S. The hope is that low-price offers will draw people to stores and apps who might order more add-ons or upgrade, the executives said.
Pizza Hut is aggressively promoting pizzas starting at 79 rupees ($0.96) that it launched last year and its India franchisee, Sapphire Foods, said it was the brand’s lowest-priced globally.
Merrill Pereyra, managing director of Pizza Hut in the Indian subcontinent, said the chain was developing products that “make the brand relevant and easy to access” for price conscious consumers in India, adding its budget pizzas were a hit with young people.
McDonald’s launched half-price meals in June. They’ll be the focus of promotion efforts in coming weeks, according to Akshay Jatia, executive director at Westlife Foodworld, which runs 357 outlets in western and southern India. He said the meals would bring in more customers and boost sales and margins.
The budget products are indeed being accompanied by a digital and physical marketing blitz across the nation – with stores, and even a posh New Delhi mall, plastered with banners, according to Reuters visits to stores across four Indian states.
ADVERTISEMENT
Domino’s flagship inflation-buster is the 49-rupee pizza, which was launched in February. Khetarpal said it was “re-engineered” by cutting price – and tomatoes – from its earlier cheapest offering of 59 rupees.
Franchisee Jubilant said in May it witnessed a cheese price surge of 40% during 2022-23, and a 30% rise in chicken and paper boxes. There have been more shocks in recent weeks, with tomato prices rising over 400% to record highs and households toiling under rising rates of everything from milk to cereals and spices, according to official data.
ADVERTISEMENT
The industry players described a tale of two consumers in a country with yawning gaps between rich and poor.
Many low and middle-income earners who saw dining at foreign chains as a lifestyle upgrade when the economy boomed are tightening belts as inflation bites, while the wealthier continue to spend on products like pricier smartphones, and SUV cars whose sales are touching new highs.
ADVERTISEMENT
When Khetarpal visited Domino’s stores in Chennai and other cities, he said he saw customers emptying out their pockets and only being able to scrape together 49 rupees. By contrast, he added, Domino’s new gourmet pizzas priced as high as $14 had seen a sales jump in some affluent areas.
‘A SMALL LAYER OF CHEESE’
It’s been a bleak year for Domino’s, the Indian fast-food restaurant leader with a market share of about 12.5%, as well as for other companies.
Pre-tax profit at Pizza Hut’s Sapphire Foods more than halved in the March quarter. Burger King’s India franchisee, Restaurant Brands Asia, saw its net loss widen by 9%.
It’s not all doom and gloom, though. Euromonitor International estimates India’s nearly $5 billion market for quick-service restaurants which serve fast food is a fraction of United States’ $341 billion and China’s $137 billion.
The narrower market for pizza, burger and chicken restaurants, dominated by Western chains and worth $2.1 billion in India, will grow, but at a slower pace. Its estimated growth rate is around 15% a year until 2027, Euromonitor forecasts. That compares with 21% growth in 2022 and 43% in 2021 largely due to a post-COVID consumption spike.
Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands sounded a bullish tone in June, comparing its 17,000 U.S. outlets to its over 2,000 in India, where it sees a “tremendous growth opportunity”.
There are still daunting challenges in the near term.
“For a population eating roadside, in the current environment where inflation is hurting their pockets, (the new offers) are still on the higher side,” said Devanshu Bansal, a consumer analyst at India’s Emkay Global Financial Services.
And many pizza-lovers like Kiran Raj will never contemplate budget offerings. The 26-year-old bank employee said he was prepared to pay a little more for a cheese-loaded product as he devoured slices at Pizza Lounge, a local restaurant in Chennai.
“I avoid buying the sub-100-rupee pizzas at stores operated by big chains as they generally contain less toppings and a small layer of cheese,” he added. “It’s just a rough crust.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/worlds-cheapest-dominos-pizza-inflation-hit-india-8849867/,business

Merger to enable HDFC Bank to take big exposure in infra projects: CEO,The fresh case against Goyal is based on a May 3 case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its Delhi office in connection with defrauding Canara Bank to the tune of Rs 538 crore.,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a fresh money laundering case against Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal and others, along with seizing incriminating documents in raids at nearly eight locations in Mumbai and Delhi in connection with the case, according to sources in the central agency.
The fresh case against Goyal is based on a May 3 case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its Delhi office in connection with defrauding Canara Bank to the tune of Rs 538 crore.
In May, the CBI had also searched seven locations, including the residence and office of Goyal, his wife Anita, and former airline director Gaurang Ananda Shetty in Mumbai.

The Jet Airways (India) Ltd was dealing with Canara Bank since 2005, and all the exposures to the accused company are under State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium arrangements.
As per the bank’s complaint, when Goyal’s companies started defaulting on repayment of loans availed from the consortium, the bank roped in a forensic auditor that thoroughly scrutinised all the transactions and documentations processed between April 1, 2011 and June 19, 2019. The forensic audit report was submitted on February 10, 2021 and pointed out “glaring irregularities”.
As per the complaint, the audit report found fraudulent features such as diversion and siphoning of funds by the accused companies.
The alleged diversion and siphoning of funds were related to commission expenses and personal expenses such as salaries of staff, phone expenses, vehicle expenses, etc., of Goyal family paid by Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
ADVERTISEMENT
The forensic audit also revealed siphoning of funds through Jet Lite (India) Ltd through advance and investing as well as subsequently writing off the same by making provisions. The company allegedly diverted the funds for making transfers to the subsidiary Jet Lite (India) Ltd in the form of loans and advances and investments extended to the company.
The auditor observed that transaction scrutiny revealed that the Jet Airways (India) Ltd was transferring borrowed funds to subsidiary/group companies by whatever modalities and not utilising funds for the intended purpose.
The accused also allegedly involved in siphoning of funds through payments made to professional and consultancy expenses, CBI sources said.

“All the (suspicious) transactions point towards cheating and misappropriation of funds by the borrower and siphoning of funds borrowed from banks being utilised for purposes unrelated to the operations of borrower, to the detriment of the financial health of the lentity and/or the lender,” states the CBI FIR.
The accused’s account was declared as fraud and reported to the RBI on July 29, 2021, for Rs 728.66 crore for the exposure of Canara Bank and e-Syndicate Bank together, of which Rs 538.62 crore pertains to the Canara Bank and Rs 190.04 crore to the erstwhile Syndicate Bank, the FIR added.
The CBI booked Goyal and others under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act for cheating, criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust by an agent person, and corruption by public servant (who could be bank officials).
The accused company was in the process of revival after Jalan Kalrock Consortium won the bid for Jet Airways under the insolvency resolution process at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
In February this year, the Bombay High Court had quashed and set aside the old money laundering case lodged by ED against Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal. It also quashed all pending proceedings and actions arising from the case against the Goyals.

In its annual report for FY23, the largest private sector lender said deputy managing director Kaizad Bharucha’s overall remuneration, excluding stock options, was Rs 10.03 crore.
Jagdishan was paid Rs 6.52 crore in FY22, while Bharucha was paid Rs 10.64 crore in the year-ago period, the report said, adding the percentage increase in median remuneration of employees was 2.51 per cent.

The CEO was paid a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.31 crore, a provident fund of Rs 33.92 lakh and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore, the report said.
Going forward, the key personnel of the lender will play an important role as they will be steering a large institution after the merger of mortgage major parent HDFC with HDFC Bank.
In his message to shareholders, Jagdishan said the merger will help the lender to take a larger exposure in infrastructure projects with the help of a much bigger balancesheet.
With its digital platforms, digital journeys and physical branch network, HDFC Bank will have the ability to offer the home loan customer a complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries’ products and services, he said.

“Savings accounts, personal loans, insurance cover, SIPs can all be bundled along with a home loan to create a compelling value proposition to the customer, that probably does not exist in the market at the scale at which this is envisaged,” Jagdishan said.
Meanwhile, he expressed concerns over the attrition rate at the bank, which had over 1.70 lakh employees at the end of March 2023.
The bank’s attrition rate was at 34.15 per cent in FY23, as against an industry average of 24.7 per cent. A total of 53,760 employees quit the bank in FY23, while 85,814 were added.

“The bank has experienced an increase in attrition over the last financial year and a significant part of which was in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels (which includes sales officers),” Jagdishan said, attributing the same to a post-COVID phenomenon, which may have prompted the younger workforce to recalibrate what they ‘want from their lives’.
Jagdishan said he wants to focus on building an inclusive organisation, which will go a long way in reining in attrition in the coming years and also seemed to be referring to lapses on the cultural front like the unsavoury conduct of a senior manager during a business review meeting recently.
“I am fully conscious of the fact that there may be instances where some people managers might transgress our defined way of working. We have the resolve to nip this in the bud, both by way of training/counselling and appropriate action, to ensure that the same is not attempted by anyone else. Having said that, we have some distance to traverse on this front,” he said.
Jagdishan said the bank is focusing on diversity, and plans to take the overall share of women in its workforce to 25 per cent by end of FY25 from the current 23 per cent.
The bank, which had invited unprecedented regulatory actions due to laxities on the technology front, has seen a significant improvement in its resilience and uptime metrics, Jagdishan said.

Talking to reporters at a skill centre in Dwarka, the first-ever Indian-American to head the top global financial institution said India is doing a lot of things which are helping it to stay ahead during times of a global slowdown.
“India is doing a lot of things which are helping it to stay ahead in times of a global slowdown. One thing that is in India’s favour is the very high percentage of GDP that comes domestically… India has come out strong from the challenges posed by the pandemic but the momentum needs to be maintained,” he said.

“The best way to maintain this momentum is growth and more jobs. India is focussed on growing more and more and generating more jobs,” he added.
Asked about India’s potential growth in high income jobs, Banga said, “We need to understand where are these jobs. They are in technology, which are very few…then they are in manufacturing. India’s opportunity currently is to cash in on the China plus strategy.

This opportunity won’t stay open for 10 years, it is a three to five years opportunity when supply chains start relocating or add another location that is going to need work.” Banga, 63, took over as the president of the World Bank last month, becoming the first person of colour to head either of the two global financial institutions — the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The World Bank President said he is preparing to pitch for private capital and corporate social responsibility funds to augment current sources of financing.
“The money we need for renewable energy resources is in a trillion dollars. We cannot pool such a huge amount with the government’s help. We need to involve the private sector,” he said.

Banga further said that the gains made on poverty over the last three to four decades across the world took a hit due to the pandemic, climate change and higher debt in some countries.
“The best way to drive a nail in the coffin of poverty is growth. You have to provide jobs to people…you have to provide education and skilling for those jobs. You have to provide healthcare for people,” he said.
Noting that India is focused on both growth and jobs, Banga said, “I am actually more optimistic with all the infrastructure investment…both digital and physical infrastructure in India”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-economy-global-slowdown-world-bank-president-ajay-banga-8848397/,business

ADB retains India’s growth forecast at 6.4% for current fiscal,"The Adani Group saw a massive fall in market cap and share prices of its listed companies following Hindenburg’s allegations. It also resulted in the Group calling off AEL's fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore FPO.","Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Group on Tuesday said the Hindenburg Research report was a mix of targeted misinformation and discredited allegations, aimed at tarnishing the conglomerate’s image.
In January this year, the US based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleging the Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, which the port-to-energy conglomerate denied. The report was released just prior to the launch of Adani Enterprises Ltd’s (AEL) Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO).
“The (Hindenburg Research) report was a combination of targeted misinformation and discredited allegations, the majority of them dating from 2004 to 2015. They were all settled by the appropriate authorities at that time.

“This report was a deliberate and malicious attempt aimed at damaging our reputation and generating profits through a short-term drive-down of our stock prices,” Adani said while addressing the shareholders at the Group’s annual general meeting.
The Adani Group saw a massive fall in market cap and share prices of its listed companies following Hindenburg’s allegations. It also resulted in the Group calling off AEL’s fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore FPO.
“While we promptly issued a comprehensive rebuttal, various vested interests tried to exploit the claims made by the short seller. These entities encouraged and promoted false narratives across various news and social media platforms,” Adani noted.
In March, the Supreme Court had set up a six-member expert committee to investigate whether there was a regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market by the Adani Group or other companies after Hindenburg Research came out.

Separately, the apex court also asked SEBI to investigate if there was a violation of the minimum public shareholding norms in public limited companies, failure to disclose transactions with related parties and any manipulation of stock prices.
Adani said the report of the expert committee, which was made public in May, did not find any regulatory failure. It also confirmed the quality of the Group’s disclosures and found no instance of any breach, he said.
“While SEBI is still to submit its report, we remain confident of our governance and disclosure standards. It is my commitment that we will continue to strive to keep improving these, every single day,” Adani said.

According to Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain, the idea is at a preliminary stage and a few global players specialising in gas storage have been approached to develop the proposal.
“We don’t have (strategic) gas reserves…We probably need some help at some point. But it is something that we are looking at…We have reached out to a few (global companies with gas storage expertise),” Jain told reporters, but declined to name any international players that the petroleum ministry or public sector oil and gas companies might be in talks with.

India explores developing strategic gas stockpile as hedge against volatility,Gupta said it is important for people to understand that there will not be quick money and that proper procedures and checks will be followed before actual funding.,"Business reality show Shark Tank India judge and boAt co-founder Aman Gupta has asserted that due diligence is and will continue to be an integral part of funding startups amid the controversy and allegations of delayed funding even after deals are struck on the show.
Gupta said it is important for people to understand that there will not be quick money and that proper procedures and checks will be followed before actual funding.
“If someone thinks it’s easy money…that rich businessmen are cutting cheques, this was a misconception that has been cleared,” Gupta told PTI in an interview.

He said that he and other ‘sharks’ earned their money through hard work and grit, and asserted that proper procedures of checks will be followed.
“We have earned the money with hard work and we will not just give our money without due diligence,” Gupta said.
Shark Tank India has done beautiful things for the country, bringing entrepreneurship and startups into dinner table conversations.
Today, families come together to watch the show, he said.
Responding to charges around delayed investments and not keeping up with commitments and promises made on the show, Gupta said, “It is not delayed funding…it is a regular course of funding and for every entrepreneur it takes time”.

He contended that during boAt’s first capital raise, the talks were initiated in 2016 but the funding came in 2018.
“In one hour, no one gets a cheque. There is a due diligence process and when we fund companies…there are companies which are not even formed…Governance aspects have to be checked…whether whatever the founder said on the show is right or wrong…we also don’t want to invest in a company where we find later that the founder is a fraud,” he said.
Gupta said he is glad that the misconceptions are being cleared before the show’s next season.

The revenue growth will be 2 percentage points lower than the one observed in the preceding January-March quarter, it said, adding that this will be the first time in eight quarters that the listed companies will show a sequential decline in revenue growth.
After an analysis of 300 companies from 47 sectors, excluding financial services and oil and gas, the report said 14 sectors are likely to witness a fall in revenue while 15 may have logged slower sequential growth.
It said lower realisations and slowing global demand for metals and industrial commodities affected makers of aluminium, steel, ferro alloys and petrochemicals.
Revenue of aluminium manufacturers likely fell 14-16 per cent owing to an 18-20 per cent decline in international prices and a sedate growth in volumes, it said, adding, steel products may have logged a 6-8 per cent contraction in revenue on the high base of the previous fiscal and a drop in realisations, which offset volume growth.

The power sector is likely to see a relatively slower 5 per cent revenue growth, it added.
“Of the total on-year incremental revenue during the first quarter, nearly 60 per cent would have been contributed by just three segments — investment-linked, export-linked, and consumer discretionary products and services,” its director Aniket Dani said, adding majority of this rise is driven by auto and cement sectors.

Kathpalia said there have not been any discussions on capital infusion with its promoters, even as the Hindujas have gone public with their resolve to infuse over Rs 10,000 crore in the bank to hike their stake to 26 per cent.
He also declined to answer queries if it will be needing the fresh capital for acquiring companies in the asset management and insurance space, given the bank’s intent to expand into such allied areas.

Food price rise shows fight against inflation far from over: RBI,"In April, India’s largest refiner IOC signed a major term contract with Russian oil major Rosneft. Although IOC did not disclose the supply volume under the contract, a Reuters report said that it was close to 1.5 million tonnes a month.","India’s public sector refiners Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) are scouting for more crude oil term contracts on favourable terms as they look to reduce the share of spot cargoes in their oil imports and diversify their crude supply basket amid volatility and uncertainty in the international oil market, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
India is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement. Currently, about 70 per cent of the public sector refiners’ oil imports are through term deals, while the rest are through spot purchases, a senior government official said. Spot contracts, as the name suggests, are immediate purchases from suppliers or traders with the shortest-possible delivery cycle. On the other hand, term contracts are longer-term deals for oil purchases with fixed volumes and pricing mechanisms.

A query sent to BYJU’S seeking comments on the inspection remained unanswered.
Think & Learn Pvt Ltd was incorporated on November 30, 2011. The last Annual General Meeting of the company was held on September 19, 2022, as per data available with the ministry.

“The company is acquiring 94.66 per cent of KEL’s (Kurlon Enterprises Ltd ) share capital at an equity valuation of Rs 2,150 crore, subject to customary adjustments for net working capital, debt and surplus cash, if any,” it said.
In a statement, the company said the cost of acquiring 94.66 per cent in KEL is around Rs 2,035 crore.
KEL deals mainly in the manufacture and marketing of foam and coir-based home comfort products across the ‘sit and sleep’ categories like mattresses, furniture cushions, pillows and coverings.
“With the coming together of Kurl On, Sheela Foam will further cement its leadership position in the modern mattress market. The investment of Furlenco would give it a very strong entry into the branded furniture market, and a much bigger market than its existing market,” Sheela Foam Chairman & Managing Director Rahul Gautam said in a statement.

He further said, “With these two within its fold, Sheela Foam is at an inflexion point, where opportunities created by inorganic activity would greatly strengthen the business model and propel a higher level of organic growth”.
KEL was established in 1962 as Karnataka Coir Products, part of the South India-based Pai family business group, and is currently headed by Jyothi Pradhan, the filing added.
The entity was renamed Kurlon Ltd in 1995. KEL was set up as a subsidiary in 2011 by Kurlon Limited. Subsequently, the business was transferred to KEL in 2014.

“The acquisition will help the company to consolidate the existing fragmented market of mattresses and foam-based products,” Sheela Foam said.
It will also help diversify the customer base as the company is the leader in northern and western India whereas KEL has strengths in southern and eastern regions of India. This acquisition will help in extending a pan-India footprint, it added.
“The Kurlon deal gives Sheela Foam an undisputed leadership across major product categories with its flagship brand Sleepwell’s strength in foam, and acquired brand Kurl-on’s strength in rubberised coir; wherein both these companies are leaders in their respective product segments,” Sheela Foam said, adding it would now command a combined market share of around 21 per cent in the modern mattress market in India.
KEL had a turnover of Rs 767.25 crore in FY2020-21 and Rs 808.80 crore in FY 2021-22.
Sheela Foam further said it would acquire a 35 per cent stake in House of Kieraya Pvt Ltd, which runs the online furniture business Furlenco for Rs 300 crore, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments.

Furlenco has a strong online presence and operates in cities, including Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi-NCR. It had clocked a turnover of Rs 129 crore in FY22 and Rs 152 crore in FY23.

“The first four months of the year, supply was still not there and our new models were yet to arrive. So actually, the real representative of our growth would be to some degree, months of May and June,” Pawah said.

India, Sitharaman said, will “look forward to furthering … bilateral interests through development cooperation and new investment opportunities through Alternate Investment platforms for renewable energy.” Yellen too in her statement said the US will “look forward to working with India on an investment platform to deliver a lower cost of capital and increased private investment to speed India’s energy transition.” The US Treasury Secretary also stressed on the need for India and the US working together to press for more ambitious and specific reforms with respect to multilateral development banks’ (MDBs) vision, incentive structures, operational approaches, and financial capacity to better address global challenges.

“We estimate that MDBs as a system could unlock USD 200 billion over the next decade just from the measures already being implemented or under deliberation as part of this process… It is also important to address the immediate need to boost the bank’s concessional lending capacity for global challenges and support low-income countries to supplement ongoing efforts,” Yellen said.
The G20 finance ministers in their last meeting in March had set up an expert group on strengthening MDBs. The group has submitted its first report which focuses on the broadening of vision, financial capacity and modalities of funding of MDBs.
The second report, which is slated to be submitted in October, will exhaustively cover mechanisms for coordination among MDBs.
“The recently released G20 MDB Experts Group report is one recent useful input to this work, though we must only explore capital increase after the reforms in these areas have progressed further,” Yellen said.

She said the US is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia, and it serves as India’s largest export market.
“Bilateral trade between our two countries reached an all-time high last year, and we expect it to grow further in the years to come,” Yellen added.
The US-India bilateral trade exceeded USD 191 billion in 2022, nearly doubling from 2014. The collaboration between the two nations spans across a range of economic issues, including commercial and technological collaboration, strengthening supply chains, and catalysing the clean energy transition.

However, some vexed issues still need to be ironed out before its implementation.

“By leveraging each other’s expertise and resources, we actively promote economic growth, foster innovation, and drive sustainable development,” the finance minister said.

In a major reform of the international taxation system, about 140 countries, including India, have agreed to an overhaul of global tax norms to ensure that multinationals pay taxes wherever they operate and at a minimum of 15 per cent rate.
However, the deal requires countries to remove all digital services tax and other similar measures and to commit not to introduce such measures in the future.
Some significant issues, including share of profit allocation and scope of subject to tax rules, are yet to be addressed and a ‘consensus agreement’ would happen after working out the technical details of the proposal.
The proposed two-pillar solution consists of two components — Pillar One is about reallocation of additional share of profit to the market jurisdictions and Pillar Two consists of minimum tax and subject to tax rules.

The regulator has asked companies to disclose agreements entered into by shareholders, promoters, related parties, directors, key managerial personnel, and employees of the listed entity or of its subsidiary, which can impact the management and control of such firms to stock exchanges.

Such agreements need to be disclosed within 12 hours in case a listed entity is a party and within 24 hours where the listed entity is not a party.
Disclosure of family settlement agreements was already required under the existing Para A of Schedule III under the LODR (Listing of Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations.
Further, for material events or information that emanate from the listed entity, including those related to acquisitions, Scheme of Arrangement, consolidation of shares, and buyback of securities, the timeline for disclosure by the entity has been set at 12 hours, according to a Sebi circular.
Besides, timelines have been fixed at 24 hours from the occurrence of the event in case the information is not emanating from within the listed entity. This included a revision in rating, fraud, or defaults by a listed entity, its promoter, or directors; restructuring about loans from banks, one-time settlement with a bank, and winding-up petition filed by any party/creditor.

BYD and privately held Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructures have submitted a proposal to Indian regulators to form an EV joint venture, the people said, asking not to be named because the application is private. The longer-term plan is to build a full line-up of BYD-brand electric cars in India from hatchbacks to luxury models, one of the three people said.
BYD, the world’s largest producer of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company previously said it planned to set up manufacturing in India, now the world’s third-largest car market.

India’s commerce and heavy industries ministries did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
BYD’s push into India is part of its rapid global expansion to challenge Tesla, which still leads in sales of EVs alone. If the India investment is approved, it would give BYD a presence in all major global car markets with the exception of the United States.
Tesla has recently restarted talks with India’s government after putting on hold plans to enter the market last year when it failed to secure lower tax duties on imported vehicles in talks with officials.
BYD has already invested $200 million in India where it sells the Atto 3 electric SUV and the e6 EV to corporate fleets, and plans to launch its Seal luxury electric sedan this year. The total production capacity proposed by BYD was not immediately clear. The maker of Blade batteries as well as finished EVs has plans to scale up to production of 100,000 EVs annually in India over a few years but would likely begin by shipping vehicles in parts for assembly in the country as it works to build up a supply chain, one of the sources said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The investment proposal also includes a plan by BYD and Megha Engineering to set up charging stations in India and build research and development and training centres, the sources said. The joint proposal comes amid stricter investment rules. Since 2020, India has tightened scrutiny of investments from neighbouring countries, including China. Those controls forced China’s Great Wall Motor to shelve a plan to invest $1 billion in the Indian market and pushed Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC’s MG Motor unit to look for a local partner.
Shenzhen-based BYD entered the Indian market in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers.
In 2013 it started building electric buses with Megha Engineering, under a joint venture company called Olectra Greentech.

BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, sold a total of 1.86 million BEVs and plug-in hybrids in 2022. In India, EVs made up just over 1% of total car sales of 3.8 million in 2022 but the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030.
In India, BYD will compete with domestic automaker Tata Motors and Chinese rival MG Motor that currently dominate electric car sales.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/china-byd-1-billion-investment-in-india-to-build-evs-batteries-8836420/,business

Senco Gold debuts at 35.6% premium on bourses,"India will not impose countervailing duty (CVD) on select steel products imported from China despite a recommendation from trade officials and lobbying from local steel manufacturers, Reuters reports.","India will not impose countervailing duty (CVD) on select steel products imported from China despite a recommendation from trade officials and lobbying from local steel manufacturers, a government source told Reuters.
In a rare move, the ministry is to reject the recommendation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) to impose 18.95% CVD on certain flat-rolled steel products imported from China for five years, the finance ministry official directly involved in the matter, told Reuters.
The decision by the finance ministry aims to protect steel consuming firms from higher prices even though it could hurt local steel manufacturers, the source said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Imposing CVD protects manufacturers, but users end up paying a higher cost,” said the official, who did not want to be named because a final decision has not been made public. “So you have to balance the interest between users and manufacturers.”
CVDs are additional taxes imposed on imported goods or products that are subsidised in their home country thus hurting the industries in the country importing them.
As per World Trade Organisation rules, a member country is allowed to impose an anti-subsidy duty if a product is subsidised by the government of its trading partner.
CVD by India on such Chinese products was removed on February last year and over 170 Indian steel companies including Jindal Stainless Ltd and Steel Authority of India have backed a petition to re-impose CVD for another five years, as per the DGTR report.
ADVERTISEMENT
In April DGTR – which is India’s trade ministry’s arm that investigates unfair trade practices – recommended CVD on some stainless steel flat products.
The finance ministry has rejected the recommendation despite steel purchases from China touching a six-year high in April-May period, with imports rising 62%.
The official said that imposing CVD would have hurt small and medium consuming companies while benefiting a few large conglomerates at a time when the economic recovery in India was rapid but uneven.
ADVERTISEMENT
The decision will further help Chinese shipments at a time when Asia’s largest economy is poised to export the most steel this year since 2016, as it was already benefiting from a weakening yuan and competitive prices, amid weak demand at home.

The Reserve Bank of India last November launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot programme, a tokenised digital version of the rupee for wholesale and retail early December.
Earlier this week, RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said the monetary authority is planning to increase the digital rupee transactions to 10 lakh/day by the end of the year from 5,000-10,000 per day now.
ADVERTISEMENT
The number of banks in the pilot has gone up to 13 from eight banks initially, and at present, there are 13 lakh users of the CBDC, including 3 lakh merchants.
There were only 1 lakh users till April-end this year, which has now been increased to 13 lakh, Sankar said.
Following the launch, the central bank in June announced CBDC interoperability with UPI systems.
With the launch of the UPI QR code on Thursday, HDFC Bank, which earlier this month took over its parent HDFC in a mega USD 40-billion merger, said it is one of the first banks to complete the integration process and allows its onboarded merchants to accept e-rupee payments from their customers, boosting usage of the CBDC in day-to-day transactions.
ADVERTISEMENT
An interoperable QR code enables basic QR payment acceptance terminals to support scan and pay features from various factors and payment options.
For customers, the key benefits of the interoperable UPI QR code with the CBDC include money transactions available in their CBDC wallet across the UPI QR code, avoiding the need to scan different QR codes at the same merchant.
For the merchants, the main benefit is that they only need to display one QR code at the storefront or through the acquiring bank mobile application, said Parag Rao, head of payments — consumer finance, technology and digital banking — at the bank.

The application is currently available to Android version 10+ users and will be launched on iOS, he added.

Those deals will not be over USD 1 billion, TCS Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director K Krithivasan told PTI during an interview here.
“Each organisation will spin out a number of deals, but there may not be a single billion dollar kind of deal in generative AI,” Krithivasan said, adding that at present, every organisation is tinkering to assess the possibilities of the new technology.
ADVERTISEMENT
TCS, which on Wednesday announced its intent to train 1 lakh associates on generative AI and working on 50 proofs of concept, is also gearing up for the changes in the landscape, Krithivasan said.
“The major impact (for) organisations will happen only when they embark on an enterprise-wide programme. As long as they keep doing some use cases here, some use cases there, some pilots here, even they will not see (the gains),” he said.
Businesses need to be sure about the returns on investments on the deployment of such technologies before they move ahead, Krithivasan said, adding that it is important for an IT company to test and understand such technologies.
It can be noted that since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI late last year, there has been an increased interest in generative AI in the tech world. In the post-earnings press conference on Wednesday, TCS Chief Operating Officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam had said every client conversation is finding a mention on generative AI now.
ADVERTISEMENT
Krithivasan said on Thursday that training of associates will not extract a significant jump in expenses, as it undertakes training efforts for its employees on a regular basis.
Meanwhile, on the overall demand environment, he said there is a prevailing softness because of the economic prospects in the US — the major market for the USD 245-billion Indian IT sector — and the IT companies will become more optimistic when they see clarity.
“Optimism or the lack of it (for tech companies) comes from the point that we don’t have a certainty on the government’s position on how they want to handle… their current belief is that they will prefer some sort of slowing down because the economy is very hot, unemployment rates are also very low,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If the governments are going to be driving a slowdown, that will have an impact on all parts of the economy, including IT spending. That’s where our uncertainty or caution comes from,” he said.
Krithivasan said once there is clarity that the US Fed interest rate would not be hiked further, or the government clearly indicates that interest rates will not go up any more, that could be a good indicator for the IT industry, as it will encourage clients to start spending.
All total contract values (TCVs) are not getting converted into revenues in the older signed deals because clients are re-evaluating their priorities on what they need to invest in, he said, maintaining that some projects get delayed or scrapped as a result.
He, however, declined to quantify the dip in the TCV-to-revenue conversion rates.
On Wednesday, TCS had reported a 17 per cent jump in Q1 net profit, but had pointed towards sluggishness on revenue growth in FY24 because of the ongoing market challenges that have led to a minuscule revenue growth on a sequential basis.

The timing of the listing was still unclear as money-losing PayPay needs to first demonstrate a clear path to profitability, the source said.
SoftBank has previously set a PayPay listing as a goal, with one executive saying in November it was worth just under 1 trillion yen ($7.17 billion). That the conglomerate is considering a U.S. listing has not been previously reported.

Representatives for PayPay and SoftBank Group’s domestic telecoms business, SoftBank Corp, said they would not comment on speculation. PayPay is owned by SoftBank Corp, its internet business, Z Holdings, and the group’s second Vision Fund.
All of the sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.
SoftBank Group shares closed up 2%, with Z Holdings surging almost 6% in their biggest one-day gain since February.
Listings of Japanese companies in New York are rare. Tokyo-based chat app operator Line had a dual listing in 2016 and later merged with SoftBank’s internet business, with more recent examples including the listing of Syla Technologies in March, according to Dealogic.

“Z Holdings shares reacted on hopes that a U.S. listing might invite a premium valuation but recent domestic listings for Rakuten Bank and SBI Sumishin Net Bank indicate there is room for fintech listings locally,” said analyst Kirk Boodry at Astris Advisory Japan, who values PayPay at 800 billion yen to 900 billion yen.
NARROWING LOSSES
SoftBank founder Son recently pledged to shift to “offence mode” amid rising global interest and investment in artificial intelligence. He has been playing defence for some time, curbing his investments after the tech sell-off hit the value of his portfolio companies hard.
PayPay, which offers QR code payment services, is used by more than 55 million people in Japan, making it a top player in a crowded digital payments market.

PayPay booked a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 11.9 billion yen in the year ended March, compared to a loss of 43.2 billion yen a year earlier.
The telecoms business is targeting profitability for its financial unit, which includes PayPay, by the year ending March 2026. PayPay is the most widely mobile payment service in Japan, according to a survey of users by Mobile Marketing Data Labo.

Nearly two dozen central banks across emerging and advanced economies are expected to have digital currencies in circulation by the end of the decade, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found in a survey, published on Monday.
Last year, the RBI began trials using CBDCs, termed e-rupees, in both the wholesale and retail markets.

Currently, large state-owned and private lenders, including State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank, are among those participating in the pilot project.
“The RBI has asked smaller banks to either tie up with fintech players or develop their systems to start CBDC pilots this year,” said the technology head of a state-owned bank, who attended the meeting with RBI officials on Tuesday.
“We will now have to float tenders to get interested fintech partners on board and evaluate the costs involved. This process is expected to take about four-five months.”
The bankers did not wish to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

The RBI aims to reach a target of one million CBDC transactions per day by the end of this year, RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 million customers and 0.3 million merchants, who used CBDC as of June 2023, he said.
“By getting more banks to participate in the pilots, the RBI wants to see if there are any glitches in implementation and conduct pilots on a large user base,” said another banker with a state-owned bank.

The talks are in a “very, very nascent” stage and no potential buyer or partner has been approached so far, and it remains unclear how the process will pan out, the person added.
“Talks have begun internally (on) what makes sense to do,” said the source, adding discussions were being driven by executives at Disney headquarters in the U.S.

Disney did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company’s shares closed up 1.6% on Tuesday.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report news of Disney’s talks and said the company had reached out to at least one bank about ways to help the India business grow, while sharing some of the costs.
The discussions come at a time when Disney has faced increasing pressure due to the emergence of Reliance Industries’ streaming platform JioCinema, run by Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. He has been marketing his streaming platform by offering free access to Indian Premier League cricket tournament, digital rights of which were earlier with Disney.
Research firm CLSA has estimated Disney+ Hotstar’s subscriber base shrank by nearly 5 million users in India after it lost the digital rights for IPL.

Reliance’s broadcast venture Viacom18, which runs JioCinema, also struck a deal with Warner Bros in April for HBO and other popular content such as Succession. Several of these top rated shows earlier aired in India on the Disney platform.
Viacom18’s shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.
Disney’s India business comprises the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and Star India, which it took over when it acquired the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox in 2019.

The source, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential, said it will be difficult to find an outright buyer in India as the enterprise value of the India business was seen around $15-16 billion when Disney took over Fox’s business.
Star India, which was rebranded as Disney Star last year, encompasses dozens of TV channels and a stake in a movie production company.
Disney, like its peers in streaming and the wider media industry, is cutting costs as macro economic headwinds weigh on its advertising revenue and subscriber growth.
In February, the company said it would cut 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs in a sweeping restructuring of the company.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/disney-explores-strategic-options-india-business-8829250/,business
Disney explores strategic options for India business: report,Business service exports have become a critical part of India's economy but the sector has been hit by a slowdown in global demand for software and challenges in big urban centres.,"The world’s major accounting firms are stepping up investments in new Indian facilities away from bigger cities as global demand for cheaper back office operations grows and smaller towns move up the economic value chain.
For decades, large multinational corporations have rushed to India’s biggest metropolises, chiefly Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru, to set up massive operational centres that employ millions, lured by vast, low-cost talent pools, particularly in IT.
Business service exports have become a critical part of India’s economy but the sector has been hit by a slowdown in global demand for software and challenges in big urban centres such as rising costs, high attrition and slow progress in getting workers to return to the office after the pandemic.

A report by Ernst & Young in June said it expects multinationals to set up “global capability centres” for all types of industries in tier-2 cities such as Jaipur, Vadodara, Kochi, and Chandigarh. The number of such centres could expand to 2,400 by 2030 from 1,600, adding 2.6 million jobs and over $100 billion to the economy.
That means more professional opportunities and potentially higher salaries in areas away from more globally connected business centres.

Deloitte, with a workforce of over 100,000 in India, says it will hire 50,000 more staff over three years, and expand its footprint in new towns while KPMG plans to hire over 20,000 over the next three years.
PwC hired close to 12,500 in the fiscal year ended March and expects to hire the same number this year, said Padmaja Alaganandan, the firm’s India chief people officer.
All of that could provide relief for the labour market amid slowing hiring in the manufacturing and IT sectors due to global growth concerns.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a service exports target of $400 billion for the current fiscal year, about 25% more than the previous year.

South Korea’s SK Hynix looking to set up chip packaging plant in India,"India achieved the target of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol in June last year, months ahead of the targeted timeline of November 2022.","E20 petrol, or petrol with 20 per cent ethanol, is now available at 1,350 fuel retail outlets and will be available all over the country by 2025, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at an industry event on Tuesday. The minister also announced that the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) — an initiative by India with support from the United States (US) and Brazil — will be opened to other countries for membership on July 22 at G20 Energy Transition Ministerial Meeting in Goa.
India achieved the target of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol in June last year, months ahead of the targeted timeline of November 2022. The success in the ethanol blending programme prompted the government to advance the deadline for pan-India E20 rollout to 2025-26 from 2030.
According to the government, the country is well on track to meet the revised E20 petrol timeline. Sale of E20 petrol was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February this year, starting with 84 retail outlets of public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs). In just about five months, the number of outlets dispensing E20 petrol has jumped to 1,350. In all, India has close to 87,000 fuel retail outlets, with the three OMCs–Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation–having a cumulative market share of over 90 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
“India is a success story in biofuels. India’s bioenergy story has the potential to be replicated in other countries while highlighting the value biofuels can bring to energy security, decarbonisation, and a circular economy to life,” Puri said.
According to the government’s estimates, the ethanol blending programme has translated into foreign exchange savings of over Rs 54,000 crore in the past nine years, while also augmenting India’s energy security. Over the past eight years, the OMCs are estimated to have paid distillers over Rs 82,000 crore for ethanol supplies, of which Rs 48,000 crore went to farmers. As for its environmental impact, the blending programme has so far led to a reduction of 30 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.
For India, which is the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement of the commodity, increasing the use of biofuels is a key tool towards two ends–reducing dependency on energy imports and limiting the carbon footprint of the country’s rapidly growing energy use.
“Globally, sustainable biofuels are one of the most important alternative sources of energy and will significantly contribute in achieving net zero (emissions). It is already economically viable and hence is in the forefront of emerging fuels,” Puri said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking about the Global Biofuels Alliance, which has been in the works for some time now and is seen as a key initiative under India’s G20 presidency, Puri said, “This will be a landmark event in the history of global energy market and has huge potential on the lines of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)”. He added that several countries are willing to join the alliance.
The US and Brazil, which are working with India to build the GBA, are seen as global leaders in biofuels and account for 55 per cent and 27 per cent of global ethanol production, respectively. The GBA is also being supported by major international organisations like the World Economic Forum, the International Energy Forum, and the International Energy Agency, among others.
Underscoring the need of a global biofuels body, Puri said that while sustainable biofuels have huge potential, there are a number of hurdles as well, including feedstock supply issues, technological limitations, policy framework, and financing and investment.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There is an urgent need to have a global platform which can address the underlying challenges and enable wider international cooperation to realise the huge untapped potential of sustainable biofuels to cater to common global goods of climate change mitigation through reduced carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development goals,” Puri said.
The GBA will have a three-category membership structure bringing together member countries, partner organisations, and industries.
“The alliance will work towards enhancing global collaboration and cooperation for accelerated adoption of biofuels by identifying global best practices for the development and deployment of sustainable biofuels and bio products,” Puri said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/e20-petrol-available-at-1350-fuel-outlets-pan-india-rollout-by-2025-puri-8827339/,business

ZEE Entertainment case: SAT rejects plea filed by Chandra and Goenka against SEBI order,"An expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court had in May had said that the difficulties experienced by Sebi in identifying holders of economic interest were at least partly because of the repeal, in 2019, of the 2014 provisions on “opaque structures”.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said that despite tightening norms to lift the veil around the ‘opaque structure’ of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), the regulator has faced a wall since entities actually controlling FPIs are in jurisdictions which leave ambiguity around entities that have economic interest in FPIs, but no ostensible control.
An expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court had in May had said that the difficulties experienced by Sebi in identifying holders of economic interest were at least partly because of the repeal, in 2019, of the 2014 provisions on “opaque structures”. The expert committee was set up to investigate if there was violation of the minimum public shareholding norms and if there was a failure to disclose transactions with related parties with respect to the allegations raised by the Hindenburg Report.
In its affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court Monday, Sebi said that with the regulatory changes governing FPIs in 2018 and 2019, it had tightened the disclosure requirement for beneficial owners (BOs) of FPIs. Further, according to the regulator, in some cases entities having economic interest in an FPI are in jurisdictions where the equivalent PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) regulations require BO identification only on the basis of control or ownership.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Thus, the investment manager/ trustee etc. acting through arrangements such as voting shares/ management shares, is then identified as the BO of the FPI. Consequently, while in compliance with the regulations, the actual investing constituents with economic interest may not be identified as BOs of the FPI. This issue is further accentuated if holdings of such investors are spread through multiple FPIs. FATF (Financial Action Task Force) has also identified the same as a global challenge,” Sebi said.
Sebi said every FPI had to mandatorily disclose all their BOs upfront, and in the absence of any natural person BO, identify an SMO (Senior Managing Official) as the BO, Sebi said. With this, the dispensation under FPI 2014 regulations that allowed certain FPIs to register, inter-alia, on the basis of an undertaking to provide BO details when sought, was no longer available. In essence, the ability of Sebi to seek additional details as required to ensure compliance with extant regulations existed both during the 2014 regime, and continue to exist currently under the 2019 regulations. There has been no relaxation of any kind on this front either, Sebi said.
The expert committee had said market regulator Sebi “suspects wrongdoing” on the ownership of FPIs but it was unable to pinpoint the violations. However, in a dig at the regulator’s policy, the committee said, “it appears that the legislative policy stance of Sebi on the ownership structure of FPIs has moved in one direction while the enforcement by Sebi is moving in the opposite direction.”
Sebi has been investigating the matter since October 23, 2020 whereas the Hindenburg Report was published on January 24, 2023. It is, however, for the Sebi to conclude the investigations in accordance with law within a precise time frame, the committee said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Considering the challenges and to address issues related to minimum public shareholding, Takeover Regulations and Press Note-3 (PN3), Sebi Board in meeting dated June 28, 2023 has approved the proposal for additional granular disclosures to the last investor from specified types of FPIs that either hold more than 50 per cent of their AUM in a single corporate group, or have a total AUM of over Rs 25,000 crore subject to certain exemptions.
The regulator also differed from the views of the expert committee on dealing with allegations of related party transactions (RPTs) – arrangements or deals between two entities which have a common interest or a relationship – by companies. The Hindenburg Report had questioned the appropriateness of over 6,000 RPTs in the Adani Group, and also pointed to 10 RPTs that were not disclosed, but ought to have been.
Sebi said if a scheme to circumvent regulations is identified, the presence of a long-standing relationship in it can lend credence to the allegation of violation. The expert committee had raised a question regarding burdening an arm’s length business relationship as being an RPT for no reason other than having been a long-standing relationship.
ADVERTISEMENT
The market regulator also said that if a company circumvents the provisions of a law, it does not take enforcement actions based on amendments that are undertaken subsequently; rather it applies the extant law on circumvention. The expert committee had said that Sebi cannot assail past transactions as being in violation of law stated as not being in force when the transactions were made. “Invoking the spirit of the law would not suffice to pursue a credible means of investigation into the matter, keeping a cloud over the transactions,” it had said in its report submitted to the Supreme Court in May.

Sebi also differed from the expert committee’s observations relating to timelines for investigations and proceedings. “Prescribing timelines for initiation of investigation and proceedings may not be appropriate as the Board is mandated to prima facie opinion to appoint an Investigating Authority… this is dependent on many factors including when the alleged violation was observed/ came to the knowledge of SEBI, analysis of the information and material available on record etc.”
Noting that the nature, scope and complexity of cases in the securities market vary significantly, and “reasonable time” to complete investigation would depend on the facts of each specific case and availability of information, the regulator argued that prescribing timelines may compromise the quality of investigation. “Additionally, completion of investigation also depends on various factors including the information provided by the persons being investigated, whether such persons are cooperative or not, availability of information from cross border financial institutions, etc. This may create constraints for the Board to function efficiently and also increase litigation,” SEBI said.
The expert committee had recommended stipulation of specific timelines for initiation and completion of investigations, initiation of proceedings, and disposal of settlement and proceedings. “Some elements of the timeline may be directory and other elements may be mandatory,” it had said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-says-tightened-fpi-regulations-but-tax-havens-pose-a-global-challenge-8825112/,business

Go First insolvency: Resolution professional seeks EoIs from prospective bidders till Aug 9,SEBI said it has continuously tightened rules concerning beneficial ownership and related-party transactions - key aspects in the allegations of Adani Group manipulating its stock price.,"Capital markets regulator SEBI on Monday told the Supreme Court that its 2019 rule changes do not make it tougher to identify beneficiaries of offshore funds, and action will be taken if any violation is found or established.
SEBI said it has continuously tightened rules concerning beneficial ownership and related-party transactions – key aspects in the allegations of Adani Group manipulating its stock price.
A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had in an interim report in May stated that it saw “no evident pattern of manipulation” in billionaire Gautam Adani’s companies and there was no regulatory failure.
ADVERTISEMENT
It, however, cited several amendments the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made between 2014-2019 that constrained regulators’ ability to investigate, and its probe into alleged violation in money flows from offshore entities has “drawn a blank”.
Without making any mention of the status report of its own investigation into allegations against Adani Group, SEBI in its latest affidavit to the Supreme Court said it did not agree with the expert committee observation of difficulties in identifying holders of economic interest behind an offshore fund.
It also differed with the panel observation that stocks will re-price if the markets feel actions taken in the past by the company were not desirable, saying even if the market may re-price the stocks of the company based on the past transactions, “there is no bar on SEBI to examine any securities laws violations because re-pricing of the stock has happened.” SEBI indicated it does not agree with the expert committee’s views and action will be taken if any violation is found/established.
After a report of US short-seller Hindenburg Research alleging accounting fraud, stock market manipulation and improper use of offshore entities by Adani Group stirred a political row and triggered a rout in the conglomerate’s stocks, dethroning Adani as the world’s third richest man, the Supreme Court had on March 2 constituted the expert committee to investigate if there was any failure to disclose transactions with related parties and if stock prices were manipulated.
ADVERTISEMENT
The committee was to work in parallel with the probe by Sebi into offshore entities investing in the Adani Group. The regulator was first asked to complete the probe in two months and then given another three months till August 14.
In the affidavit, SEBI said its 2019 rule changes in fact “tightened the disclosure requirement” related to beneficial owners.
In its 43-page filing, SEBI opposed the expert committee’s recommendation that a firm timeline for the regulator to complete its investigation must be “embedded into the law”, saying prescribing such limits “may compromise the quality of investigation”, create constraints and increase litigation.
A bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud is scheduled to hear the ongoing Adani-Hindenburg case on Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the affidavit, SEBI has given its views on the recommendations by the expert committee on issues like effective enforcement policy, judicial discipline, robust settlement policy, necessary timelines, surveillance and market administration measures, creation of financial redress agency and others.
“Prescribing timelines for initiation of investigation and proceedings may not be appropriate as the Board is mandated to form a prima-facie opinion (reasonable grounds) to appoint an investigating authority,” it said.
“Further, the nature, scope and complexity of cases in the securities market vary significantly, and ‘reasonable time’ to complete investigation would depend on the facts of each specific case and availability of information.
Therefore, prescribing specific timelines to complete the investigation may compromise the quality of the investigation,” the SEBI said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/adani-row-sebi-disagrees-expert-panel-action-violation-found-8824428/,business

India has identified chip-making as a key priority for future economic growth, hoping to capitalise on companies looking to diversify their operations from China.

"FPIs continue to buy Indian shares in Q2; pump in Rs 21,944 crore in first week of July","The central government can issue such exemptions to entities through a notification, and the Women and Child Development Ministry, along with the IT Ministry, is expected to assess a platform’s privacy standards for children for granting them exceptions.","The upcoming data protection Bill could empower the central government to lower the age of consent from 18, and also exempt certain companies from adhering to additional obligations for protecting kids’ privacy if they can process their data in a “verifiably safe” manner, The Indian Express has learnt.
The change is a major departure from the draft Digital Data Protection Bill, 2022 that was floated last November, under which the age of consent was hardcoded at 18 years – meaning that for processing data of individuals below the age of 18, companies were required to seek their parents’ consent. The upcoming Bill, it is understood, will take a graded approach to defining the age of consent on a case-by-case basis.
This had been a key ask of the industry, especially social media companies, as a hardcoded age of consent would have meant business disruptions for them on account of setting up new systems for obtaining parental consent for users under 18 years of age — a key demographic for such services. However, it is in line with data protection regulations in the Western world, with regions like the European Union and the United States prescribing a lower age of consent.
ADVERTISEMENT
The change was made on account of considerations that children can be independent stakeholders on the Internet, and might want to access services without always needing their parents’ consent, a senior government official told The Indian Express.

Under the data protection bill that is expected to be tabled in Parliament’s Monsoon session, the definition of a child is understood to have been changed to an “individual who has not completed the age of eighteen years or such lower age as the Central Government may notify”. In the 2022 draft, the definition of a child was an “individual who has not completed eighteen years of age”.
Certain entities that deal in collecting and processing children’s data can also be exempted from seeking parental consent if they can ensure that the “processing of personal data of children is done in a manner that is verifiably safe”.
The central government can issue such exemptions to entities through a notification, and the Women and Child Development Ministry, along with the IT Ministry, is expected to assess a platform’s privacy standards for children for granting them exceptions.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The changes will allow platforms that develop strong, proven and verified safeguards for children an option of dealing with children’s data without parental consent, for instance, online education related services,” the official said.

Under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), age of consent has been kept at 16, but it allows member states to lower it to as much as 13. The United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has capped the age of consent at 13, and verifiable parental consent is needed only for those who are younger.
Other key changes to the upcoming Bill include further relaxations to cross-border data flows to international jurisdictions – by moving away from a whitelisting approach, to a blacklisting mechanism, as reported earlier by this newspaper.

RIL fixes July 20 as record date for share allotment in demerger process,Adani Enterprises last month announced that it has signed a pact to acquire 100 per cent of SEPL.,"Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of billionaire Gautam Adani’s group, has bought a close to 30 per cent stake in Start Enterprises Pvt Ltd, which owns the online train ticket booking platform Trainman.
Adani Enterprises last month announced that it has signed a pact to acquire 100 per cent of SEPL.
In a stock exchange filing on Saturday, Adani Enterprises said Adani Digital Labs Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, has bought a 29.81 per cent stake in SEPL for Rs 3.56 crore.
SEPL had a turnover of Rs 4.51 crore in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year.
ADVERTISEMENT
While last month, Adani Enterprises had described SEPL as “an online train booking and information platform,” on Saturday it described the firm as one into “e-commerce and website development.” The announcement last month had led to a mini-controversy with Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh seeking to suggest that Adani’s takeover of Trainman may eventually result in the takeover of IRCTC – the Indian Railways’ ticketing and other services arm.
IRCTC had issued a statement to deny the allegation. Explaining the e-ticketing business segment, IRCTC had said that around 14.5 lakh reserved tickets are booked on a daily basis in Indian Railways. Out of these almost 81 per cent are e-tickets and booked through IRCTC itself. Hence, there is no competition between IRCTC and its agents, including Trainman.
Trainman, being a B2C partner of IRCTC contributes 0.13 per cent of total reserved ticketing, it had said adding since these firms are integrated with IRCTC, overall, they help the customers in a smooth ticketing process.
Founded in 2011 by Vineet Chirania and Karan Kumar, Trainman is an Indian travel booking app that enables passengers to check the PNR (Passenger Name Record) status, predicts the possibility of getting a confirmed seat in case of a wait-list, and also provides real-time updates on seat availability, running status, time table, coach position, fare calculator, etc.
Trainman is Adani group’s second investment in the travel booking and information segment.

"Jaiprakash Associates defaults on Rs 4,044 crore loan repayment","In a consultation paper released Friday, the TRAI has asked stakeholders to send suggestions about regulating services and whether a selective banning of OTT services can be done as opposed to shutting down the entire Internet.","Almost three years after it first recommended against creating a specific regulatory framework for over-the-top (OTT) communication services like WhatsApp, Zoom, and Google Meet, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is revisiting its stance and starting consultations on how these services can be regulated.
In a consultation paper released Friday, the TRAI has asked stakeholders to send suggestions about regulating services and whether a selective banning of OTT services can be done as opposed to shutting down the entire Internet. Regulating such services has been a long standing demand of telecom operators, who have for years, been advocating for ‘same service same rules’.
The development signals the intersectionality in regulations around Internet services, with multiple government agencies claiming a stake in the sector. The draft telecom Bill released by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) last year had also recommended bringing OTT services under its ambit by creating a licensing regime for them. The IT Ministry is already the nodal ministry for regulating such services.
ADVERTISEMENT
The TRAI has essentially argued that while telecom operators and OTT services like WhatsApp offer similar services, they are not bound by the same requirements – as a result, there is a need for regulatory parity.
It said that telecom operators need a service licence for offering voice and SMS services, and on the other hand  “OTT communication service providers offer voice call, and messaging and video call services similar to the services provided by TSPs, without any such licence”.
TRAI said that shutdown of telecommunications or the Internet can have “significant ramifications for a country’s economy”. “It also disrupts critical services such as education and healthcare. Consequently, such a shutdown affects the life and livelihood of the citizens of the country,” the regulator said.
This has been cited as a reason to explore selectively banning OTT apps, as opposed to the whole Internet, a recommendation that was first made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on IT.

“…websites that use dynamic IP addresses and are hosted on cloud servers can pose a challenge to conventional methods of blocking,” TRAI said. “Advanced techniques can be employed to identify and block access to such websites.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/trai-begins-consultations-on-regulating-ott-services-8813350/,business

On Thursday, senior advocate Ramji Srinivasan appearing for the resolution professional of Go First told the NCLT that the airline will challenge the high court order.

There are inconsistencies between the order passed by the single-member bench of the high court and the directions given by the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal).
“As things are presently advised, we are considering challenging it,” he said.
Shailendra Ajmera is the resolution professional of the airline.
In its 46-page order passed on Wednesday, Delhi High Court Justice Tara Vitasta Ganju said the resolution professional “is not required to take control” of the assets owned by a third party.
The high court had also directed the DGCA to permit the lessors, their employees and agents to access the airport, where 30 aircraft are currently parked and to inspect them within three days.

As per the earlier NCLT order, the resolution professional is to keep the aircraft and engine, which are under his possession, as airworthy.
Go First is going through Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). On May 10, the NCLT admitted the airline’s voluntary plea for initiating the resolution proceedings.
Srinivasan also told the tribunal that the DGCA has formed a special audit committee that will audit the aircraft and its readiness before permitting restarting of operations as per the business resumption plan.

The report of the DGCA is expected in a few days, he said.
A funding of Rs 450 crore has also been secured from the lenders, he said, adding that the amount will help give an impetus to run the airline.
Meanwhile, the airline has filed its reply before the tribunal on the pleas filed by the lessors of aircraft and engines.
The lessors alleged that the resolution professional is not maintaining their aircraft as per the NCLT’s last order.
One of the lessors JSAIL (Jackson Square Aviation Ireland Ltd) told the tribunal everything the resolution professional is doing is detrimental to Go First.

Its counsel Arun Kathpalia said holding the aircraft will only increase the costs and other troubles for Go First.
A two-member NCLT bench comprising Members Mahendra Khandelwal and Rahul Prasad Bhatnagar had granted lessors a week’s time to file their rejoinder.
The tribunal has directed to list the matter for hearing on August 4.

Go First to challenge high court order on inspection of planes by lessors,"Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, the ministry said.","The external sector may challenge India’s growth outlook for 2023-24, the Finance Ministry said in a report released Thursday. The ministry flagged a number of factors that could constrain the pace of growth: volatility in global financial systems, sharp price corrections in global stock markets, the impact of El-Nino, and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.
The European Union’s (EU) introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for which reporting of carbon content in exports to the EU would be required to begin from October 1, 2023, is one of the impending downside risks to India’s exports, it said in the Annual Economic Review for 2022-23.
India’s domestic demand, however, is strong and high-frequency indicators indicate a healthy picture of the state of the economy, the ministry said, adding that urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions. Rural demand is also on its path to recovery with robust growth in two- and three-wheeler sales, it said.

The government and the Reserve Bank of India expect India to grow 6.5 per cent in FY24.
The challenge from the external sector comes as net exports did not work as well for the economy in the second half of 2022-23 as they did in the first half. Also, high import prices and high import demand amid weak external demand have resulted in negative net exports in real terms that have shown a sharp downward trajectory and prevented India’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth from crossing the pre-pandemic trend trajectory, it said.
Noting that the higher annual growth in FY23 was driven mainly by better-than-expected growth in the January-March quarter, the ministry, however, said that consumption and investment demand have surpassed the pre-pandemic trend trajectory.
“Enabled by the release of pent-up demand, real Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) has surpassed the pre-pandemic trend trajectory. Similarly, a large step-up in public sector capex over the last three years and a favourable credit situation in the country have contributed to real Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), also surpassing the pre-pandemic trend trajectory,” it said.

“However, the faster growth in post-pandemic economic activity in the Indian economy and high import prices have kept the import demand elevated. As a result, the negative net exports in real terms have shown a sharp post-pandemic downward trend trajectory as compared to a slightly upward pre-pandemic trend trajectory. This has prevented the post-pandemic real GDP trend line from crossing the pre-pandemic trend trajectory, although it is very near to doing so. Given the decline in prices of India’s import basket and a sustained surge in service exports, the net exports gap is expected to become smaller sooner than earlier expected. This will enable real GDP to surpass its pre-pandemic trend trajectory in the near future,” the report added.
India’s GDP had clocked a higher-than-expected growth rate of 6.1 per cent in January-March 2023, in turn pushing up the growth estimate for 2022-23 to 7.2 per cent, as per data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31. In February, NSO had estimated GDP growth for FY23 at 7.0 per cent.
The report said that India’s macroeconomic management has been stellar despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors. For inflation as a challenge, the report said India’s inflation breached the target to a lesser extent as compared with other emerging economies and advanced economies, adding that the RBI did not have to increase the policy rates as much as central banks of other countries did.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure raise the possibility that India can enjoy sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to in several decades. Strong balance sheets and digital advancements could lead to better credit decisions allowing India’s financial cycle to sustain for longer periods before encountering the challenge of bad debts. Thus, India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before. Nonetheless, it is no time to rest on laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to,” it said.
India, however, needs to watch FDI data closely and take measures to facilitate inflows after recording a decline in net FDI by 27.4 per cent in FY23. Measures would also be required to facilitate large capacity creation, last-mile infrastructure issues and labour availability, the ministry said. Foreign direct investment flows may get impacted by political distance more than geographical distance, the report said, citing International Monetary Fund (IMF) research, adding that this policy space may need India’s increasing attention in the coming months and years.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/domestic-external-sector-affect-fy24-growth-finmin-8793686/,business

Centre to soon notify rules for setting up GST appellate tribunals,"Russia had its refinery maintenance peak from mid-May and mid-June, which lowered that country’s crude oil consumption and triggered an upswing in oil exports, mainly to India.","India’s import of discounted Russian crude oil is likely to have peaked in June and could be headed for a month-on-month decline in July, marking the first instance of sequential fall in almost a year, as per estimates by commodity market analytics and intelligence firm Kpler.
According to Viktor Katona, Kpler’s Lead Crude Analyst, a decline in oil production in Russia and a higher demand pull from Russian refineries is expected to result in slightly lower dispatches to India. There are also expectations of a slight contraction in demand from Indian refiners in July and August as a few units would be under maintenance shutdowns during the monsoon, as the rainy season usually marks a dip in India’s oil demand.
In June, Indian refiners imported 2.17 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude, accounting for a little over 45 per cent of India’s total oil imports of 4.78 million bpd for the month, an analysis of Kpler data showed. The average daily quantity of Russian oil imported into India in June was marginally higher than the previous peak of 2.15 million bpd in May.
ADVERTISEMENT
From being a marginal player in India’s oil trade before the war in Ukraine, Russia is now New Delhi’s biggest source of crude oil. And for Moscow, India is now the biggest consumer of seaborne Russian crude oil. Indian refiners started snapping up Russian oil soon after the latter’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Russia started offering deep discounts on its oil.
India’s Russian crude imports in June were more than the cumulative oil import volumes from at least the next four biggest suppliers–Iraq, Saudi Arabia, United States, and United Arab Emirates. For the second month running, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) beat private sector major Reliance Industries (RIL) as India’s biggest importer of Russian crude.
July, however, is expected to mark the first instance of a sequential fall in India’s Russian oil imports since August of last year. Kpler estimates 2 million bpd as the sustainable peak of India’s consumption of Russian oil. India’s overall refining capacity stands at around 5 million bpd and the country, while being the third-largest consumer of crude oil globally, depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement of the commodity.
“We believe India’s imports of Russian crude will see a slight downward correction to 2 million bpd, which will be the sustainable level of buying that disregards whatever domestic dynamics Russian producers are facing,” Katona told The Indian Express. According to him, the nearly 2.20 million bpd of Russian oil imported by Indian refiners in May as well as June was “really a one-off event” driven by maintenance of Russian refineries during the period.
ADVERTISEMENT
Russia had its refinery maintenance peak from mid-May and mid-June, which lowered that country’s crude oil consumption and triggered an upswing in oil exports, mainly to India.
However, the Russian refineries are now out of maintenance and are consuming a total of around 5.6 million bpd of crude oil, up from around 5 million bpd during the peak maintenance season. Additionally, Russia’s overall crude oil production has also seen some decline and is unlikely to rise notably, given that Moscow will have to stick to its agreed production targets as part of the coordinated output action by OPEC+ group of major oil producing nations.
 The next round of refinery maintenance works in Russia is expected in September-October, and Katona believes that there could be another upswing in Russian oil supplies to India during that period. By then, the planned maintenance works at Indian refineries during the ongoing monsoon season are also expected to be completed, which means that India’s oil demand should be at normal levels at the time.

 Over the past two-three months, industry watchers and experts have been indicating that India appears to be testing its limits of Russian oil imports. Apart from the factors already mentioned, another key reason is the soft limit placed by Indian refiners’ purchase commitments for sour grades of crude under term contracts with their traditional suppliers in West Asia.
 The medium-sour grade Urals crude has been the mainstay of India’s Russian oil imports. West Asian nations have traditionally been India’s major suppliers of sour crudes, and a considerable portion of these supplies are under annual term contracts, which have minimum purchase commitments. Most of the Russian oil, on the other hand, is being bought by Indian refiners on spot basis. This essentially means that the extent to which Urals can replace other sour crudes is limited by Indian refiners’ minimum offtake commitments under term deals.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/after-hitting-fresh-high-in-june-indias-russian-oil-imports-may-decline-in-july-8699762/,business

“The ongoing rally in the market has made valuations very rich. Nifty is trading at above 20 times the estimated FY 24 earnings. This is higher than the historical average. Momentum can take the market higher, but at high valuations risk is high.
“Some presently unknown negative developments can trigger a sharp correction. So, even while remaining invested in the market, investors have to be cautious,” V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.

The premium over the historical average implies increased optimism about medium-term growth, Shantanu Bhargava, Managing Director, Head of Discretionary Investment Services, Waterfield Advisors, said.
“Markets will be impacted in the near term by events such as the Fed’s monetary policy stance, corporate earnings, and election results. However, the markets’ vulnerability to foreign flows would be much lower, at least in the medium run. If a correction occurred because of foreign outflow – that could be an opportunity to invest in an otherwise extremely good underlying narrative,” Bhargava added.

Pawan Hans strategic sale: Centre disqualifies bidder on ‘integrity issues’,Read on to know how home loans come with home loan tax benefits that allow home loan borrowers to save a considerable amount of money in taxes each year.,"These days, most homebuyers avail of a home loan to buy a home. Even those who can afford to pay for a house in one go prefer to avail of a home loan to facilitate home purchase. Home loans allow borrowers to keep their savings safe for a rainy day. Further, home loans come with home loan tax benefits that allow home loan borrowers to save a considerable amount of money in taxes each year. With the help of a home loan, homebuyers can claim tax deductions up to Rs.3.5 Lakh and higher, provided they meet certain conditions. Home loans are repaid in the form of EMIs. Each EMI is divided into two parts: the first part covers the interest component of the home loan, and the second part covers the principal component. Borrowers can claim a housing loan tax benefit on both the principal as well as the interest component of a home loan. Let us look at how home loan borrowers maximise savings with home loan tax benefits available to Indian tax payers. 
Home Loan Tax Benefits Explained 
Home Loan Tax Benefits Under Section 80C 
Home loan borrowers can claim tax benefits on payments made towards the interest component of a home loan under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Under this section, the maximum limit for claiming tax deductions is Rs.1.5 Lakh. Home loan borrowers must also keep in mind that home loan tax benefits claimed under Section 80C get reversed if the home loan borrower sells their home within 5 years of buying it. Further, borrowers must also keep in mind that Section 80C of the Income Tax Act does not only deal with tax benefits on home loans. Various other tax-saving schemes, such as ELSS, Public Provident Fund, National Pension System, National Savings Certificate, etc., are also covered under this section. However, the combined limit for these tax-saving instruments under Section 80C is Rs.1.5 Lakh.
2. Home Loan Tax Benefits Under Section 24b 
Unlike Section 80C, which deals with several different tax-saving instruments, section 24b of the Income Tax Act deals only with the tax benefits available on the interest component of a home loan. Under this section, home loan borrowers can claim tax benefits up to a maximum of Rs.2 Lakh on payments made towards the repayment of the interest component of a home loan. However, there are a few things that one must know about home loan tax benefits under Section 24b. One can avail of a home loan only for buying or constructing a home. Let’s assume you bought a home while it was still being constructed. In this case, you will be able to claim tax benefit on the interest component of the loan only after construction is complete. You will have to claim tax benefit on the interest component in five equal instalments spread over 5 years. If the construction of the property does not get completed within 5 years of availing of the loan, the maximum tax benefit that one can claim under Section 80C automatically gets reduced to Rs.30,000 per year. Borrowers must also know that while the limit for claiming tax benefit on the interest component of a loan for self-occupied homes is Rs.2 Lakh, there is no limit for claiming tax benefit on the interest component of the loan if the property is a let-out property or in other words, you have rented it out.

3. Home Loan Tax Benefits Under Section 80EE 
Individual borrowers and first-time homebuyers can claim an additional tax benefit up to Rs.50,000 on the interest component of their home loan until the end of their loan tenor provided they had availed of a home loan between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 to buy an affordable house, the value of which at the time of buying the house was not above Rs.50 Lakh and the value of the loan availed of for the purpose of buying the home did not exceed Rs.35 Lakh. Tax deductions available under Section 80EE are over and above the tax deductions available under Section 24b of the Income Tax Act. Section 80EE came into effect in 2013 and was valid for only 2 years. However, this section was reintroduced in 2016 and now those eligible to claim tax benefit under it can continue to do so until the end of their loan tenor. 
4. Home Loan Tax Benefits Under Section 80EEA 
Individual home loan borrowers and first-time homebuyers who had availed of a home loan between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2022 can claim an additional tax benefit up to a maximum of Rs.1.5 Lakh and over and above the tax benefits available under Section 24b of the Income Tax Act provided they had invested in affordable housing and the stamp value of the home bought with the loan money at the time of availing of the loan did not exceed Rs.45 Lakh. Further, only those home loan borrowers can claim tax benefit under this Section of the Income Tax Act who are not eligible to claim tax benefit under Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act.
Final Words 
In conclusion, by way of home finance, home buyers and tax payers become eligible for several tax benefits and can claim tax deductions in lakhs and save a considerable amount of money. Further, home loan borrowers must also know that in case of joint home loans, all home loan applicants can claim tax benefits separately. Thus, in case of a joint home loan availed of by a couple, a husband and wife can claim tax benefits separately and maximize their combined tax savings to Rs.7 Lakh or even higher. Home loan borrowers must familiarize themselves with the various sections of the Income Tax Act and how they can claim tax benefits under these various different sections and maximize their tax savings.

FPIs have been bullish on Indian equities on the expectation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has come to the end of its rate hike cycle. Retail inflation eased to 4.25 per cent in May.
“India is the best-performing economy compared to the other economies. The corporate sector also showed a turnaround in the fourth quarter. These are the factors because of which we have seen more FPI interest in India,” said Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda (BoB).
Renewed interest from FPIs helped Sensex surge by around 10 per cent in the first quarter. Higher fund flows also resulted in a stable rupee during the quarter.

The rupee moved in a narrow range of 81.68 to 82.90 against the dollar in the April-June period. In the fourth quarter of FY23, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth was much stronger than expected at 6.1 per cent as against 4.5 per cent in the preceding quarter.
Higher Q4 growth pushed the FY23 growth estimate to 7.2 per cent. For FY24, the RBI has projected real GDP growth at 6.5 per cent, with Q1 growth at 8 per cent.
Corporate sector recorded a fairly steady performance in Q4 of FY23 driven by pent-up demand in several areas which helped to push up their turnover. The correction in commodity prices also helped to bring down input costs in the latter part of FY2023, a BoB research report had said.

In June, the RBI left the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent for the second consecutive policy after inflation continued to be in its comfort zone of 2-6 per cent. In April, retail inflation declined to 4.7 per cent from 5.7 per cent in March 2023. It further eased to 4.25 per cent in May.
So far in the calendar year 2023, FPIs have purchased Rs 76,407 crore of domestic shares. They were sellers of equities in January (Rs 28,852 crore) and February (Rs 5,294 crore). Overseas investors turned buyers of domestic shares in March.
“January and February 2023 saw massive flows to China triggered by China’s opening up after Covid and expectations of a revival in growth and earnings. The FPI strategy was ‘Sell India, Buy China’. It was based on the view that China is cheap and India is expensive. This strategy proved to be a mistake since the prospects of China deteriorated and that of India improved,” Geojit Financial Services’ Chief Investment Strategist V K Vijayakumar said, adding that FPIs have reversed their strategy to ‘Buy India, Sell China’.
Experts believe that FPIs are likely to continue their investments in domestic equities in the second quarter as corporates’ earnings are expected to remain better, leading to an improvement in valuations.
However, some market participants believe that the capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) new disclosure norms for FPIs could dent foreign inflows.

In a letter to the over 4,000 employees from HDFC who joined the bank’s rolls on Saturday, Jagdishan said the future is bright, and the work on realising the potential of the merger starts now.
“The runway for financial services and mortgage, which are so underserved and under penetrated, is going to be very large. HDFC Bank – the combined entity – with a large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more than adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, will be best positioned to capture growth. The pace at which we aim to grow – we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,” he said.
HDFC Bank began the day one after the merger with a rebranding exercise, wherein it is putting up its colours at all the over 500 branches and offices of HDFC Ltd. The erstwhile HDFC’s corporate headquarters at Ramon House already sports the HDFC Bank branding, and officials estimated that the entire exercise will be over in the next 24 hours.

It can be noted that dedicated teams have been put in place to make the merger as seamless as possible, right since its announcement on April 4 last year. As part of the USD 40 billion all-share deal, the biggest in Indian corporate history, HDFC Bank had committed to absorb all the over 4,000 employees of its parent. “Our work starts from today, in realising the potential of what this merger holds for us,” Jagdishan wrote. To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.
It will continue investments on the digital front as well which, Jagdishan said, will make HDFC Bank into a ‘technology company into banking”, and added that the same will get unveiled over the next three years. The bank will be assessing its people on the basis of how they conduct governance and compliance, teamwork and their ability to delight customers, he said.
The canvas being offered to the HDFC Ltd employees is large — both professionally and personally, the email said, adding that an external expert was appointed to arrive at the right formula for inducting people into the bank and deciding their role in the hierarchy.
Jagdishan said the cost-to-revenue ratio of HDFC at 0.04 per cent was the lowest for any mortgage company in the world, and thanked its leadership, including Deepak Parekh, Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad, for creating such an institution. He said from a customer perspective, the home loan is a very emotional product which establishes a great bond between the financier and borrower and added that HDFC Bank would like to harness the same bond. “The penetration levels of the home loan product in its (HDFC Bank’s) customer base and the extent the distribution has been leveraged, is quite low. This is an opportunity! The runway for growth is going to be large and for a long time to come,” Jagdishan said.

HDFC Bank will move from sales management to a relationship management model because of the opportunity to cross-sell that exists within the franchise after the addition of mortgage finance, insurance and asset management subsidiaries, Jagdishan said. “The velocity of product sales and the reduced touch points to serve the customer will be a game changer with this ‘power of bundling’,” he added.

The performance of the crude oil & natural gas and electricity segments were dismal, with all reporting contraction on the Y-o-Y basis.
On a sequential basis, the core sectors expanded 3.5% in May. The output growth of these eight sectors slowed down to 4.3% in April-May this fiscal, against 14.3% in the year-ago period.

The eight core sectors have a combined weight of 40.3% in the index of industrial production (IIP). Among sectors, coal production increased 7.2%, aided by the focus of Coal India and private captive miners on raising output to meet the higher demand from thermal power units during summer months. Crude oil production declined by 1.9%. A sluggishness in demand for natural gas, partly owing to high prices, led to a marginal decline of 0.3% in output.
Production of petroleum refinery products, which have a weight of 28% in the core sector index, increased 2.8% in May while steel production rose 9.2%. Cement output expanded 15.5%, recording the second consecutive month of double-digit growth.

Das also said incidentally, with the CIMS going live, the first weekly statistical supplement, which is the RBI”s weekly data release on its own operations and on developments in banking and financial markets, was compiled and processed in the CIMS for the week to June 23.
The new system will disseminate more data for public use and will also support online statistical analysis by external users at their end, the governor said, adding regulated entities will also have access to their past data and their assessment on quality parameters in the new system.
The Reserve Bank established its first enterprise-wide data warehouse, the Central Database Management System (CDBMS) in 2002 and from November 2004 a large part of this data system was placed in the public domain as the database on the economy or on the DBIE portal.
Over the years, this portal has evolved from a simple data repository to an information processing and management system, which has become the Reserve Bank’s data dissemination platform. The DBIE remains very popular among domestic and international researchers, analysts, and general public, especially students. It received over 2.5 lakh hits in May 2023.

He also said following the recommendation of the Reserve Bank’s Regulations Review Authority 2.0 (RRA 2.0) a system-based submission of the remaining email-based reporting will be implemented through the CIMS in the coming months.
Since any systemic transition with multiple dimensions involving large number of entities is prone to teething trouble, Das said the RBI teams will support reporting entities for a smooth transition, wherever necessary. The new system will also have several new features in the coming months.
Das noted that the Reserve Bank was a pioneer to set up its data warehouse over two decades ago.

Giving a comparison of the tax rates of various goods pre and post-GST rollout, the government said from streamlining processes to boosting investments, GST has been a catalyst for progress.
“The implementation of GST has made it easier for taxpayers to comply with tax law and this can be seen in the fact that the number of registered taxpayers has increased from 1.03 crore that enrolled into GST by April 1, 2018 to 1.36 crore by April 1, 2023,” the office of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted.

A nationwide GST, which subsumed 17 local levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT and 13 cesses, was rolled out at the stroke of midnight on July 1, 2017.
Under GST a four-rate structure that exempts or imposes a low rate of 5 per cent tax on essential items and a top rate of 28 per cent on luxury and demerit goods is levied. The other slabs of tax are 12 per cent and 18 per cent.
Besides, there is a special 3 per cent rate for gold, jewellery and precious stones and 1.5 per cent on cut and polished diamonds. Besides, a cess is levied on the highest tax slab of 28 per cent on luxury, sin and demerit goods.
“GST, which was introduced six years ago by subsuming 17 taxes and 13 cesses levied by the central and state governments, has not only helped in reducing tax burden on the citizens but has also proven to be the engine for driving consumption in the country,” Nirmala Sitharaman’s office tweeted.

In the pre-GST era, the total of VAT, excise, CST and their cascading effect led to 31 per cent as tax payable on an average, for a consumer.
“With reduced taxes, #GST brings happiness to every home: Relief through #GST on various consumer goods of daily use,” the Finance Ministry tweeted.
GST has turned out to be a gamechanger in India’s indirect tax system and has provided a wide range of benefits to all stakeholders. The benefits include reduction in prices of various goods and services, level playing field for all taxpayers and revenue augmentation through improved compliance, the Government said.

However, the ONS said Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year was 0.5% smaller than it was before in the final quarter of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, also in line with a previous estimate.
“The final Q1 2023 GDP data confirms that the economy steered clear of a recession at the start of 2023. But with around 60% of the drag from higher interest rates yet to be felt, we still think the economy will tip into one in the second half of this year,” Ashley Webb, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.

Britain’s economic recovery since the COVID-19 pandemic has been much slower than almost every other big advanced economy, though Germany has struggled too and its economy in the first quarter was 0.5% smaller than before the pandemic.
British households have been put under pressure by a surge in inflation, which hit a 41-year high last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent natural gas prices soaring, and has been slow to fall since.
Friday’s figures showed that households’ real disposable income was 0.8% smaller than the previous quarter, reflecting higher costs for electricity, gas and food.
There were also signs that people were saving less in response to the increased cost of living, as the savings ratio fell to 8.7% in the first quarter from 9.4% in the quarter before, its lowest level since the second quarter of 2022 though well above its pre-pandemic average.

“Investors can trade and clear the Nifty contracts through SGX as they have been doing for more than two decades. Orders will be routed via the Connect to NSE IX for trade matching and executed trades will be cleared and settled on SGX,” said Kan, an equity market veteran with over three decades of experience.
Kan has seen through the development of the Nifty derivatives, as investors’ interest in the Indian equity markets grew over time.
Operating in an AAA-rated global financial centre as well as a neutral trading and clearing venue, SGX is well placed to help internationalise the Nifty brand when the index was incepted by NSE in 1996. NSE and SGX inked a partnership and the USD-denominated Nifty futures were launched on SGX in September 2000.
Today, it accounts for 52 per cent of the offshore open interest in Indian equity indices, ahead of all other Indian equity indexes.

“This speaks volumes of the demand and interest in the Nifty contracts and the international branding that SGX has built for the domestic India benchmark,” Kan added.
Further, Kan said the transition of the Nifty trade matching to a single liquidity pool in Ahmedabad aims to build a larger unified market, creating a deeper liquidity pool with participation from both India and global investors.
“We are enlarging the ecosystem through the GIFT Connect,” she underlined. “The market has the potential to increase manifolds.” The GIFT Connect is fully supported by the government and regulatory authorities in India and Singapore.

Nomura has been the most bearish, cutting its forecast for growth in China’s gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 5.1% from 5.5%. That downgrade even takes into account the prospect of new stimulus.

India’s ATF export volumes so far in June have averaged at a record high of 208,433 barrels per day (bpd). As per Kpler data, the previous peak of 206,871 bpd was in June 2018. More than half of the dispatched ATF volumes from India this month are headed for Europe, where they are likely to arrive in July as the voyage usually takes about a month.

As per Kpler’s estimates, European imports of ATF in July are likely to be around 435,482 bpd, of which 131,136 bpd, or over 30 per cent, are likely to be from India. Indian refiners, particularly export-oriented private sector players Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, have emerged as major suppliers of refined petroleum products to Europe as the continent shuns Russian crude oil and petroleum fuels over the war in Ukraine. Interestingly, this comes alongside Indian refiners snapping up discounted Russian crude, leading to the perception that products derived from Russian barrels may be reaching European shores via India.

The Kpler data shows that India had the biggest share in Europe’s jet fuel import deliveries in April and May as well, but volumes declined considerably in June with imports from Kuwait registering a healthy growth.
Also Read | ‘With green transition, India has the opportunity to become new energy hub’
July falls in the middle of the European summer travel season that lasts from June to August. The period usually sees high travel demand in the continent, and consequently, jet fuel consumption there also goes up. Europe’s jet fuel import data of the past few months shows that the continent’s major sources of jet fuel are Kuwait, India, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.
According Kpler’s Lead Crude Analyst Viktor Katona, the jump in India jet fuel exports is timely from the point of view of Indian refiners. “This (high ATF export volumes) comes in very handy for Indian refiners as the monsoon season has historically hindered domestic Indian fuel demand. So, having plentiful export outlets help maintaining high refinery run rates,” said Katona. Demand for fuels and other petroleum products tempers during the monsoon in India due to lower demand for transportation fuels and refined products used in some industries where work slows down because of the rains.

According to Katona, with the Indian government doing away with the cess on jet fuel exports on March 4, exports of the fuel are unimpeded. From July 1, 2022, the government had imposed windfall gains tax by way of cesses on domestic crude oil and exports of refined fuels – petrol, diesel, and ATF to tax super-normal profits of oil producers and fuel exporters due to the surge in global oil prices and fuel margins.
ADVERTISEMENT
Although India, the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil, depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its oil requirement, the country is a net exporter of petroleum products thanks to its refining capacity of 250 million tonnes per annum, or around 5 million bpd, which is higher than its domestic demand. As a large refining hub that has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian oil, India now finds itself playing an increasingly prominent role in the global crude oil and refined products supply map.

Even as the West was initially irked at India’s rising purchases of Russian oil in the aftermath of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, major Western powers like the US have come to terms with the rising supply of Indian refined products to Europe. This is mainly because in their view, refiners in countries like India are ensuring that the global oil and refined products market remains balanced and adequately supplied, despite Russian oil and products being shunned by numerous countries.
In fact, various experts see higher purchases of Russian oil and rising exports of petroleum products to Europe from countries like India as critical for the success of the price caps on Russian oil and refined products imposed by G7 countries and their allies without causing a global supply shock.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/jet-fuel-exports-to-europe-help-meet-summer-rush-set-for-new-record-8693301/,business

TCS cracks whip against 6 staffers in bribery case,The increase in Europe's largest economy comes a day before the release of inflation figures for the entire 20-country area that uses the euro currency.,"Inflation is pushing in different directions in Europe, rising in Germany and falling again in Spain, official figures said Thursday.
German consumer prices jumped 6.8 per cent in June from a year earlier, up from May’s 6.3 per cent, the state statistics office Destatis said. The figure was boosted in part by a widely used offer of cheap transport tickets last summer, analysts said.
The increase in Europe’s largest economy comes a day before the release of inflation figures for the entire 20-country area that uses the euro currency. Inflation in the eurozone has been falling from its peak of 10.6 per cent in October, coming in at 6.1 per cent in May.

But that is still far above the target of 2 per cent set by the European Central Bank. ECB chief Christine Lagarde has warned inflation is persistent enough to warrant at least one more interest rate hike at the bank’s July 27 meeting.
Higher interest rates are central banks’ chief tool against inflation.

"Banks say LRS tax a ‘burden’, unlikely to have IT systems ready by October","The main allegation by the US Federal Trade Commission is expected to be that Amazon leverages its power to reward those online merchants that use its logistics services and punish the ones who don't, the report said.","The U.S. antitrust regulator is planning to file a suit targeting Amazon.com’s core online marketplace in the coming weeks, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.

Inflation is moving in different directions in Europe. It hit 6.8% in Germany and 1.6% in Spain,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank may have to tighten its oversight of the American financial system in the wake of the failure of three large US banks this spring.,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank may have to tighten its oversight of the American financial system in the wake of the failure of three large US banks this spring.
Powell said in prepared remarks delivered at a banking conference in Madrid that tougher regulations put in place after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made large multinational banks much more resilient to widespread loan defaults, such as the bursting of the housing bubble that led to that crisis.
But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank exposed different vulnerabilities that the Fed will likely address through new proposals, Powell said.

He did not provide details, but other Fed officials have said banks should be required to hold more capital in reserve to guard against loan losses.
Such proposals are likely to face resistance from the banking industry and some congressional Republicans, who argue that the Fed had the necessary tools to prevent the bank collapses but failed to use them.
One reason regulators missed the threats to the three banks was “the natural human tendency to fight the last war,” Powell said.
The 2008 financial crisis occurred because of widespread defaults after the housing bubble burst. But Silicon Valley Bank failed for different reasons: A rapid increase in interest rates sharply lowered the value of its bond holdings, because they paid out lower interest rates than newer bonds.

“These events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of institutions of the size of SVB,” Powell said. “I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate.” In a question and answer session, he indicated that the rules needed to be updated to account for how quickly a bank run could happen.
“A bank run used to be people standing in line at an ATM,” the Fed chief said. “That’s very different from what we saw at Silicon Valley Bank,” with depositors using smartphones to move money instantly.
Fed supervisors had spotted bank vulnerabilities, including exposure to rising rates, but were working within a system that moved too slowly to head off trouble, Powell said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The supervisors were on the right issues, but they were operating under a standard playbook where you escalate things fairly carefully, fairly slowly,” he said.
An ongoing review of Fed supervision would “try to find ways to be more agile and, where appropriate, more forceful,” Powell said.
Banks with USD 100 billion to USD 250 billion in assets — which included all three failed banks — were freed from some requirements in 2018 under legislation passed by Congress and rules issued by the Fed.
Last week, Powell faced significant pushback from Republicans during House and Senate hearings over the potential for tighter rules. Michael Barr, the Fed’s top regulator, has said the central bank might require larger banks to hold more capital in reserve.
Yet GOP members of Congress charge that such requirements would limit banks’ ability to lend and slow the economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
Powell said during those hearings that a proposal might be issued next month. But he repeated Thursday that any new rules would require a public comment process and would be phased in over time, meaning they might not come into effect for several years.
“The bank runs and failures in 2023 … were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/federal-reserve-tighten-financial-rules-us-bank-failures-jerome-powell-8692651/,business
US antitrust regulator plans to target Amazon’s online marketplace: Report,"In the biggest merger in the history of India Inc, HDFC in April 2022 said it would merge with its own banking subsidiary in a $40-billion all-stock deal.","The market regulator Sebi does not see any need for giving more time to mutual fund houses with large holdings in the merger-bound HDFC twins, to realign their portfolios post-merger since there’s no material data and given the highly liquid nature of these stocks demanding such an extension.
In the biggest merger in the history of India Inc, HDFC in April 2022 said it would merge with its own banking subsidiary in a USD 40-billion all-stock deal — after 46 years of being a home loan financier and in between creating the country’s largest private sector bank and four other financial sector brands in the insurance, AMC and brokerage businesses.
And this Tuesday (June 27), HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said the boards of the Corporation and HDFC Bank will meet on June 30 to finalise the last contours of the merger which is expected to be effective July 1..
ADVERTISEMENT
He has also said that would be the last meeting of HDFC board and also his as the chairman after working in the company from day one of its inception in October 1978.
After a marathon board meeting, Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch told reporters late last night at her headquarters that “available data do not demand that mutual funds should be given more time to realign their portfolios after the merger of the HDFC twins.
“There is no material evidence to suggest that the merger and the resultant increase in their holdings in the much larger HDFC Bank needs any special attention since only a few schemes will have marginally larger than the permissible 10 per cent holding,” she said, adding “and none of them will have more than 12 per cent holdings in the merged bank.”.
She further said, another reason is that the HDFC twin stocks are so liquid there is no worry about market demand. Moreover, there are already existing exceptions in place and fund houses already have three months to realign.
ADVERTISEMENT
She admitted that mutual funds umbrella body Amfi had sought some special dispensation to realign their portfolios and on checking the holding structure data we found that there is no room for any concerns in terms of market volatility due to merger-driven selloff in the bank stock.
The reverse merger of HDFC into the bank will create a financial services titan with a combined asset of Rs 31.9 lakh crore and a loan book of Rs 22.2 lakh crore as of March 2023 numbers. The entities combined booked a net income of Rs 60,348 crore for FY23 (Rs 44,109 crore by the bank and Rs 16,239 crore by the Corporation).
The combined shares of the HDFC twins will have the highest weighting on the indices at over 14 per cent, much higher than the present index heavyweight Reliance Industries with a tad more than 10 per cent weighting.

Post merger, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and the existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sebi-time-mutual-funs-realigning-portfolios-hdfc-twins-merger-8692597/,business
"Federal Reserve may tighten financial rules after US bank failures, says Powell",Sebi will be finalising a draft discussion paper in a month or two to formulate rules and guidelines to regulate the mushrooming number of unregistered financial influencers or finfluencers who offer investment advisors to the public.,"Market watchdog Sebi will be finalising a draft discussion paper in a month or two to formulate rules and guidelines to regulate the mushrooming number of unregistered financial influencers or finfluencers who offer investment advisors to the public.
The statement from Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch comes on the heels of the income tax department reportedly sending notices to top 35 social media influencers for not paying taxes worth crores of rupees and after last week’s searches on the top 13 Youtubers in Kerala for similar offences.
“We are crystalising a discussion paper to regulate financial influencers. The paper should be ready for public comments in the next couple of months,” Buch told reporters late last night after a marathon board meeting wherein the board approved a rash of regulatory measures including halving of the share listing time to three days the present six after an IPO.
ADVERTISEMENT
The board also decided to tighten the disclosure norms for large foreign portfolio investors.
Explaining the regulatory position, the chairperson said, “We’ve no problem if someone chooses to educate investors/would-be-investors about the market and investments. But there is a serious problem if they are offering unsolicited investment advice and are not registered with the Sebi.” There are numerous unregistered finfluencers who are manipulating the market and offer qualified advice to the gullible public and earn huge money by way of commission from these platforms on one hand and on the other from the market by transacting on those stocks they talked up or talked down.
With the number of such people thriving on social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp and Twitter in recent years, Sebi has been cautioning the public against falling into their advisory traps on one hand and also hinting at bringing out regulations to contain their free-run.
After the February 2023 board meeting Sebi made its mind clear for the first time when its whole-time member Ananth Narayan Gopalkrishnan had said, “We’ll come out a discussion paper seeking inputs for making effective measures to control unsolicited financial and market advice from social media influencers and also from unregulated investment advisors. After inputs from market participants, and other stakeholders, we’ll issue guidelines to rein them in.” There is also the issue of unregistered investment advisors, who pose greater risks to gullible investors. More importantly, we see examples of misuse of their Sebi registrations by even some registered advisors, he had noted.

The need for guidelines for social media influencers on financial matters has been abuzz lately with the mushrooming of application-based content, where popular influencers promote a particular asset class without a proper licence or knowledge to do so.
Earlier, Sebi had clamped down on some WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels, which were used to leak key market-moving data. This led to many large companies stopping their earnings pressers which were normally held on weekdays to Saturdays and also altogether stopping media interactions.
Sebi has been planning to direct brokers, mutual funds to limit use of financial influencers to curb the spread of financial advice via social media advertising and marketing campaigns through such influencers.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since January 2022, Sebi has been saying it would come out with regulations to tame the so-called financial influencers, it has not yet issued anything but has been acting selectively on such manipulators.
For instance in January 2022, it found market abuse through stock recommendations using Telegram. On March 2 this year, Sebi cracked down on Youtubers and barred about 44 entities from the securities market in an interim order passed for manipulating prices and making illicit gains.
Again, as late as May 27 this year, Sebi fined Rs 6.5 crore on finfluencer PR Sundar and banned him from the market for a year, for alleged violations of investment adviser norms.
Sundar, who is a Youtuber and options trader, has settled the case after paying the fine. This action marks the first instance of action taken against a finfluencer (financial influencer) by the market regulator.
Sebi’s investigation revealed that Sundar was operating the website prsundar.blogspot.com where he offered various packages for providing advisory services. Payments for these services were collected through a payment gateway linked to the bank account of Mansun Consultancy, of which Sundar is a co-promoter.
ADVERTISEMENT
The case, dating back to 2022, involved Sundar, his company Mansun Consulting, and Mangayarkarasi Sundar, his co-promoter. They are strictly prohibited from buying, selling, or dealing in securities for one year from the date of the settlement order. Sundar also did not have a Sebi registration.
As part of the settlement, they agreed to pay Rs 46.80 lakh (Rs 15.60 lakh for each Mansun Consultancy and two of its directors) and disgorge Rs 6 crore, which includes the profits earned from the advisory services amounting to Rs 4.6 crore and the associated 12 per cent interest.

No TCS for credit card spends abroad for now as govt puts decision on hold: What it means,"International credit card spends outside India will not fall under the ambit of the LRS for now, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.","Days before the new rule was set to kick in, the Union government on Wednesday deferred its decision to include international credit card spends outside India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).
The big point: International credit card spends outside India will not fall under the ambit of the LRS for now, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday. Further, the proposed increase in TCS rates, which was previously supposed to be implemented from July 1, has now been pushed to October 1.
Simply put: What this simply means is that for now, transactions made through international credit cards while travelling/living overseas would not be counted as part of LRS and hence would not be subject to TCS. The government has not yet given a date for when credit card spends will be brought under the LRS, but has said that the new TCS rates under LRS will be effective from October 1.
To understand what LRS and TCS are, refer to the cheatsheet below.
The official statement: “Firstly, it has been decided that there will be no change in the rate of TCS for all purposes under LRS and for overseas travel tour packages, regardless of mode of payment, for amounts up to Rs. 7 lakh per individual per annum. It has also been decided to give more time for the implementation of the revised TCS rates and for inclusion of credit card payments in LRS,” the Ministry of Finance said in a press release.
The why: The postponement of the decision aims to give adequate time to banks and card networks to put in place the requisite IT based solutions, the government clarified.
Rewind: The Budget 2023-24 had proposed hiking the TCS rate to 20 per cent from 5 per cent above Rs 7 lakh threshold for all purposes other than education and medical treatment. Also, for overseas tour packages, the government had proposed hiking the TCS rate to 20 per cent from 5 per cent, without any threshold, with effect from July 1.
ADVERTISEMENT
Further, on May 16, the Centre had amended rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), bringing international credit card spends outside India under the LRS.
Cheatsheet:
LRS: The Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) allows Indian residents to remit (transfer), up to $2,50,000 (approximately Rs 2.06 crore) outside the country without prior approval from the RBI. Travelling abroad for tourism and business, education, medical purposes and other common foreign transactions fall under the purview of the LRS.
TCS: Tax collected at source (TCS) is an extra amount – over and above the sale amount of a particular good/service – that is taken as tax by the seller from the buyer at the time of sale. The amount is deposited to the tax authorities. It is important to note that the TCS paid can be adjusted against the tax payable by an individual when the income tax return is filed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/no-tcs-credit-card-spends-abroad-government-puts-lrs-decision-hold-explained-8691824/,business

Senior representatives of the current management of Go First, which has stopped flying since May 3, discussed various aspects of the revival plan with officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in the national capital on Wednesday, they said.
The budget carrier, which was owned by the Wadia family, is in voluntary insolvency resolution proceedings.
According to the sources privy to the development, the airline’s EY-backed Resolution Professional Shailendra Ajmera and Interim CEO Kaushik Khona made a detailed presentation to the DGCA officials on the revival plan.
DGCA will also conduct an audit to assess the airline’s operational preparedness once it completes the scrutiny of the documents.
The audit is expected to take place next week, one of the sources told PTI. The second source said the airline, prior to the grounding, was operating to and from 29 domestic destinations. Under the revival plan, the number of destinations is to be reduced to 23.

"ONGC sells KG gas to Torrent, GAIL at $11","In an e-auction, the firm sold 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day - a fraction of the planned output from the block that sits next to Reliance Industries' prolific KG-D6 area in the Bay of Bengal, to Torrent Gas Pune Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has sold initial gas it is producing from its KG basin fields in the Bay of Bengal to three firms, including Torrent Gas, sources said.
In an e-auction, the firm sold 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day – a fraction of the planned output from the block that sits next to Reliance Industries’ prolific KG-D6 area in the Bay of Bengal, to Torrent Gas Pune Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).
GAIL picked up 0.8 mmscmd while HPCL took 0.42 mmscmd and Torrent 0.12 mmscmd, sources aware of the matter said.
The company had sought bids from users like city gas operators that sell CNG to automobiles and pipe cooking gas to households, companies using gas to produce fertiliser or make electricity, LPG producers and traders, for the gas from its KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block.
ONGC asked companies to quote a premium ‘P’ that they are willing to pay over and above the rate arrived at by calculating 14 per cent prevailing Brent oil price plus USD 1 per million British thermal unit, the tender document showed.
At current Brent crude oil price of USD 74 per barrel, the base price comes to USD 11.3 per mmBtu (USD 10.36 per mmBtu at 14 per cent of Brent oil price plus a mark-up of USD 1).
The sale price will however be the lower of the price arrived at using this formula or the rate that oil ministry’s arm PPAC notifies twice a year for deepsea fields.
ADVERTISEMENT
The ceiling price for difficult to produce fields like deepsea for six months starting April 1 is USD 12.12 per mmBtu.
So the gas price for Torrent and others would be USD 11.3 per mmBtu.
The company has yet again delayed the start of production from the main fields in the block.
ADVERTISEMENT
ONGC was originally to start gas production from Cluster-II fields in the KG-D5 in June 2019 and the first oil was to flow in March 2020.
The company blamed contracting and supply chains issues due to the pandemic for shifting the start of oil production first to November 2021, then to the third quarter of 2022 and then to June 2023.
Gas output start target was first revised to May 2021, then to May 2023 and then to May 2024 for non-associated gas to start flowing.
However, these timelines have now been shifted to August, sources said.
A floating production unit, called FPSO, which will be used to produce oil, is already in Indian waters.
ONGC will start with 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day and reach the peak of 45,000 bpd in 2-3 months, they said adding some gas would also flow with oil but actual gas output will start in May 2024 when 7-8 mmscmd production is expected.
ADVERTISEMENT
The production estimates are however much lower than what was originally projected.
At the time of its launch in April 2018, ONGC had said the estimated capital expenditure would be USD 5.07 billion and operational expenditure would be USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
The block has a number of discoveries that have been clubbed into three clusters — Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.
Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.
ADVERTISEMENT
Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.
Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years. Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.
But now the output estimate is lower – 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/ongc-sells-kg-gas-torrent-gail-8692054/,business

“It shows the depth of the bonds we share, the living bridge between our two nations, the thriving business links, and the flow of ideas and investments, all stronger than ever. But of course, we want to do more,” he said.
“Here we are, in Downing Street, with a Prime Minister of Indian heritage, with all of you at the top of your game, leaders in your fields showing that anything is possible.

"Adani-Total Gas Ltd to invest Rs 20,000 cr in 8-10 yrs to expand city gas","Adani Total Gas Ltd will invest Rs 18,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore in the next 8 to 10 years to expand infrastructure for retailing CNG to automobiles and piping gas to households and industries, its CFO said.","Adani Total Gas Ltd, the joint venture of billionaire Gautam Adani’s group and French energy giant TotalEnergies, will invest Rs 18,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore in the next 8 to 10 years to expand infrastructure for retailing CNG to automobiles and piping gas to households and industries, its CFO said. The company retails CNG to automobiles and pipes gas to household kitchens for cooking purposes in 52 licences that cover 124 districts of the country. It has 460 CNG stations in the country and about 7 lakh consumers of its piped cooking gas.
It is looking to expand its network of CNG stations as well as pipeline network that takes the gas to household kitchens and industries, to tap into the country’s growing appetite for cleaner fuel.
In the company’s latest annual report, Adani Total Gas Ltd (ATGL) chief financial officer Parag Parikh said the company invested over Rs 1,150 crore in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) for creating additional infrastructure.
“From a long-term perspective, we continue to be optimistic of gas prospects. There is a larger priority to moderate pollution as gas remains a preferred clean energy source with high user safety, customer trust and delivery convenience,” Parikh said.
The firm is looking at investing more in creating infrastructure and expanding its network.
“For our city gas distribution (CGD) business, we intend to invest around Rs 18,000-20,000 crore in the next to 8-10 years to build infrastructure that widens our customer base and sustains revenue growth,” he said.
AGTL CEO Suresh P Manglani said the firm’s strategy is to fast-track steel pipeline laying and build CNG stations faster across the licenses where it operates for early monetization.

“I am happy to share that your company is going to build over 1,800 CNG stations in the next 7-10 years and committed to connecting every home across all our geographical areas (GAs) desiring to have cleaner and greener piped natural gas in their kitchen,” he said.
Besides scaling core business of gas distribution, the firm has embarked on diversifying its bouquet of choice – CNG, compressed biogas (CBG) and EV charging.
“The time is coming when we will have widened our portfolio of service to a range of clean fuels that address different applications for different consumers, reinforcing our positioning as a one-stop comprehensive service provider,” he said.

India is targeting to increase the share of natural gas, which is less polluting than liquid fuels, in the economy to 15 per cent of its energy mix by 2030 from the current 6 per cent. And city gas is an area the government is prioritising for this.
He said the government’s move to cap the cost of natural gas will bring stability in prices and prioritise availability to the city gas distribution network. “This price stability and supply predictability will empower companies like yours to enhance services around this stable pricing and accelerate the country’s fuel preference in line with the stated policy.” On new opportunities, Manglani said ATGL has formed two separate units for e-mobility and biomass.
“Foraying into the rapidly growing segment of e-mobility, ATGL has formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Adani TotalEnergies E-mobility Limited (ATEL). Presently, ATEEL is engaged in setting up EV charging infrastructure for two, three and four-wheelers (including bus) at various locations across the country”.
EV charging is a natural fit in ATGL’s existing business of CNG retail outlets and is a step towards offering alternative fuel choices to consumers, he said.
ATGL already has 104 charging points at 26 locations across the country. This it intends to scale it up to over 3,000 EV charging points across the country.

He said the floor and ceiling set by the government for the majority of the gas produced within the country will “ensure a stability in domestic gas prices and get India beyond the gas volatility of FY 2022-23.” Adani TotalEnergies Biomass Limited (ATBL) is ATGL’s wholly owned subsidiary to tap into India’s huge potential of biomass derived energy. ATEBL is currently building one of India’s largest Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants at Barsana near Mathura in UP with eventual 600 tonnes per day feedstock processing capacity.
In addition to utilizing agricultural and livestock waste as feedstock, the company is also actively seeking opportunities in the municipal solid waste (MSW) segment to expand its CBG production footprint. CBG is suitable for transportation and utilization in the CGD network.

Sebi notifies rules allowing PE funds to sponsor mutual fund houses,Capital markets regulator Sebi has notified rules allowing private equity funds to sponsor a mutual fund house as they can bring in strategic guidance and talent to drive the growth of the industry.,"Capital markets regulator Sebi has notified rules allowing private equity funds to sponsor a mutual fund house as they can bring in strategic guidance and talent to drive the growth of the industry.
Currently, any entity that owns 40 per cent or more stake in a mutual fund is considered a sponsor and is required to fulfill the eligibility criteria.
“A private equity fund or a pooled investment vehicle or a pooled investment fund may also be permitted to sponsor mutual funds,” Sebi said in a notification adding that this is subject to certain conditions.
Under the eligibility criteria for the sponsor of MF, Sebi said that sponsors need to adequately capitalise the asset management company (AMC) such that the positive liquid net worth of AMC should be at least Rs 150 crore.
In addition, the capital contributed to the AMC would be locked in for 5 years, besides, the minimum sponsor stake of 40 per cent would also be locked in for five years, according to the notification issued on Monday.
Further, the regulator said that “Self Sponsored AMCs” can continue the mutual fund business. This is subject to AMCs fulfilling certain conditions. The move would give the original sponsor flexibility to voluntarily disassociate itself from the MF without needing to induct a new and eligible sponsor.
In addition, the regulator has increased the role and accountability of the trustees in a bid to safeguard unitholders’ interests. Also, the regulator enhanced the accountability of the board of AMC.

Further, the regulator said that a unitholder protection committee (UHPC) by the board of an AMC would be constituted. This is part of Sebi’s attempt to have an independent review mechanism for the decisions of AMC from the perspective of the unitholders’ interest across all products and services.

"Bad loans come down further, gross NPAs at 3.6% by next March","If the macroeconomic environment worsens, though, the GNPA ratio may rise sharply, the central bank said in its Financial Stability Report (FSR) for June 2023 released on Wednesday.","THE GROSS non-performing assets (GNPA) of the country’s scheduled commercial banks, which declined to a 10-year low of 3.9 per cent in March 2023, is expected to fall further to 3.6 per cent by March 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said Wednesday. If the macroeconomic environment worsens, though, the GNPA ratio may rise sharply, the central bank said in its Financial Stability Report (FSR) for June 2023 released on Wednesday.
The estimate for GNPA for March 2024 is based on the macro stress tests performed to assess the resilience of banks’ balance sheets to unforeseen shocks emanating from the macroeconomic environment. One of the reasons for the fall in gross NPA in 2022-23 was large write-offs by banks.

“As per the stress test results, the GNPA ratio of all SCBs may improve to 3.6 per cent by March 2024 under the baseline scenario,” the RBI said. However, if the macroeconomic environment worsens to a medium or severe stress scenario, the GNPA ratio may rise to 4.1 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively, the central bank’s half-yearly report said.
At the bank group level, the GNPA ratios of public sector banks (PSBs) may swell from 5.2 per cent in March 2023 to 6.1 per cent in March 2024 under the severe stress scenario, whereas it may go up from 2.2 per cent to 3.8 per cent for public sector banks and from 1.9 per cent to 2.6 per cent for foreign banks.
Stress tests are conducted covering credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, and the resilience of commercial banks in response to these shocks is studied. Using the stress tests, the RBI projects impairment or bad loans and capital ratios over a one-year horizon under a baseline and two adverse scenarios – medium and severe.

Higher loan growth, decline in slippages, better recoveries and write-offs of bad loans contributed to the improvement in the asset quality of banks in fiscal ended March 2023.
“The write-off to GNPA ratio, which had been declining consecutively through 2020-21 and 2021-22, increased in 2022-23 due to large write-offs by private sector banks,” the RBI said in the report.

In the fiscal ended March 2023, the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined to 1 per cent – a level last observed in June 2011. A low NNPA ratio indicates the active and deep provisioning made by banks.

The report said while there has been an overall improvement in asset quality in respect of personal loans in FY23, impairments in the credit card receivables segment have risen marginally. Within the industrial sector, asset quality continued to improve across sub-sectors.
The asset quality of the top 100 borrowers improved, with their share in banks’ GNPA declining from 6.8 per cent as of March 2022 to 1.6 per cent as of March 2023.

In the foreword of the FSR report, RBI Governor Shaktikanata Das said the financial sector in the country has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers. “Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth,” Das wrote.
He said the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies suggests that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system, the Governor said.
“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” Das said. He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.
The FSR report said that the macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios.

SEBI halves IPO listing time to 3 days; tightens disclosure norms for FPIs,SEBI said the reduction in listing timeline is likely to benefit the issuers to receive their funds and allottees to receive their securities in a shorter time period.,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Wednesday slashed the time period for listing of shares in public issue from existing six (T+6) days to three (T+3) days, from the date of closure of the issue.
The regulator also tightened the disclosure norms for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). The decisions were taken in a board meeting held on Wednesday. It said the revised IPO listing timeline of T+3 days will be made applicable in two phases – voluntary for all public issues opening on or after September 1, 2023 and mandatory on or after December 1, 2023.
SEBI said the reduction in listing timeline is likely to benefit the issuers to receive their funds and allottees to receive their securities in a shorter time period.
It will help the subscribers who were not alloted shares in an initial public offering (IPO) to receive their money back quickly.
“Resources of all stakeholders like stock exchanges, banks, depositories, brokers in public issue process will be deployed for a shorter period,” the regulator said in a press release issued after its board meeting.
The tighter disclosure norms for FPIs are aimed at guarding against possible circumvention of regulations such as Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) or disclosures under Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations.
They will also protect against possible misuse of the FPI route to circumvent the requirements of Press Note 3 (PN3), issued during Covid pandemic to check opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of stressed Indian companies at a cheaper valuation. This came on the back of the Adani-Hindenburg row. The US-based short seller Hindenburg, in its research report, had alleged that some FPIs held a significant stake in the listed companies of the Adani Group – a claim the conglomerate has denied.

FPI holding more than 50 per cent of their Indian equity AUM (asset under management) in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that individually, or along with their investor group holding more than Rs 25,000 crore of equity AUM in the Indian markets will be required to make additional granular level disclosures regarding ownership, economic interest, and control, SEBI said.
The regulator has, however, exempted certain entities, including government and government-related investors, pension funds and public retail funds and corporate entities, from making additional disclosures.
The board also approved regulations that require listed entities having outstanding listed NCDs (non-convertible debentures) (as on December 31, 2023) to list their subsequent issuances of NCDs at the stock exchanges.
ADVERTISEMENT
The new norm, which will come into effect from January 1, 2024, is aimed at facilitating transparency in price discovery of NCDs, better disclosures to investors and the market and to check possible mis-selling of unlisted bonds, SEBI said.
The markets regulator further said that the sponsor of InvIT (infrastructure investment trust)/ REIT (real estate investment trust) will be required to hold a certain minimum unitholding on a reducing scale for the entire life of the InvIT/ REIT. Presently, SEBI regulations mandate the sponsor to hold a minimum of 15 per cent units for a period of at least three years from the date of listing of units.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sebi-halves-ipo-listing-time-to-3-days-tightens-disclosure-norms-for-fpis-8691530/,business
"Decision put on hold, credit card use abroad not to attract TCS","Currently, overseas tour package and LRS spending attracts 5 per cent TCS and there is no threshold.","In a reversal of its earlier decision, the government on Wednesday decided to defer the decision to include international credit card spends outside India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). This, in effect, means there will be no levy of Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on international credit card spends outside India as of now.
The government also extended the timeline to levy the higher proposed TCS rates with effect from October 1 instead of July 1 this year. This postponement has come amid banks raising concerns about the unpreparedness of their reporting systems to roll out the differential TCS levy for various categories such as medical, education, overseas tour packages among others.
Explained | International credit card spends outside India will attract 20% TCS: How cardholders may be impacted
With this, the TCS levy is back to its stated position as announced in the Budget for 2023-24 till the new rates kick in from October 1 and the inclusion of international credit card spends outside India under LRS is going to take a longer time. Government sources said the TCS levy, for all practical purposes, is now in cold storage.
In a release issued Wednesday, the Union Finance Ministry said the decision has been taken after “discussions with various stakeholders, and taking into account comments and suggestions received” and to give adequate time to banks and card networks to put in place requisite IT-based solutions. “The increase in TCS rates; which were to come into effect from 1st July, 2023 shall now come into effect from 1st October, 2023 with the modification as in (ii) above. Till 30th September, 2023, earlier rates (prior to amendment by the Finance Act 2023) shall continue to apply,” the ministry said in a statement.

The threshold of Rs 7 lakh per financial year per individual will be there for TCS on “all categories of LRS payments, through all modes of payment, regardless of the purpose”. This implies there will be no TCS up to Rs 7 lakh remittance under LRS. Beyond this Rs 7 lakh threshold, TCS shall be levied at the rate of 0.5 per cent (if remittance for education is financed by education loan); 5 per cent (in case of remittance for education/medical treatment); and 20 per cent for others.
EXPLAINED
The move, the rethink
Expanding the TCS on outward flow of money was the main aim in the Budget decision this year. Money flowing outside India under LRS accounts for nearly 0.8 per cent of the GDP, and this does not include the spending outside India through credit cards. The idea to levy TCS on overseas credit card spend, which met with opposition from many sections, has almost been put in cold storage now.
On purchase of overseas tour packages, TCS of 5 per cent will be applicable on payments up to Rs 7 lakh. Above the Rs 7 lakh threshold, 20 per cent TCS would be levied from October 1.
Currently, overseas tour package and LRS spending attracts 5 per cent TCS and there is no threshold.
ADVERTISEMENT
Through the Finance Act 2023, the government had amended sub-section (1G) of section 206C of the Income-tax Act proposing an increase in the rate of TCS to 20 per cent from 5 per cent for remittance under LRS as well as for purchase of overseas tour program package and removed the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for levy of TCS on LRS. These amendments were to come into effect from July 1. No changes were made for remittance for education or medical purposes.
On May 16, the Centre amended rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), bringing international credit card spends outside India under the LRS. As a consequence, spending on international credit cards would have then attracted a higher rate of TCS at 20 per cent from July 1. Later, on May 19, after widespread criticism over the tweaks, the Finance Ministry had specified a uniform Rs 7 lakh threshold per year for international debit and credit card transactions to be excluded from the limit under the LRS and, hence, the levy of TCS until this monetary limit.
Under LRS, all resident individuals, including minors, can remit up to US $250,000 (approximately Rs 2.06 crore) abroad per year without prior approval from the RBI. The government, in the notification allowing credit card spends under LRS, had said the decision was taken in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/decision-put-on-hold-credit-card-use-abroad-not-to-attract-tcs-8691435/,business
Overseas spending using credit cards not to attract TCS,"For the purchase of an overseas tour programme package, the TCS shall continue to apply at the rate of 5 per cent for the first Rs 7 lakhs per individual per annum; the 20 per cent rate will only apply for expenditure above this limit, the ministry added.","The government on Wednesday said overseas spending using international credit cards will not be included under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) and hence, would not attract TCS.
Also, the implementation of a higher rate of tax collected at source (TCS) of 20 per cent on overseas remittances under LRS, like tour expenses, has been deferred by three months and will come into effect from October 1.
However, Credit card spending overseas will not attract TCS from October 1.
The higher TCS rate will be applicable only when the LRS payments exceed the threshold of Rs 7 lakh.
The government, in Finance Bill 2023, had increased the rate of TCS from 5 per cent to 20 per cent for remittance under LRS as well as for the purchase of overseas tour programme packages and removed the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for triggering TCS on LRS.
These two changes were not applicable when the remittance is for education or medical purpose. These amendments were to take effect from July 1, 2023.

“India is the only major economy with energy transition momentum accelerating across the Energy Transition Index’s equitable, secure and sustainable dimensions,” the WEF said.
“For example, despite continued economic growth, India has successfully reduced the energy intensity of its economy and the carbon intensity of its energy mix, while achieving universal energy access and effectively managing affordability of electricity,” the WEF added.
Achieving universal access to electricity, replacing solid fuels with clean cooking options and increasing renewable energy deployment have been primary contributors to the improvement of India’s performance.
India also emerged relatively less affected from the recent energy crisis, largely due to the low share of natural gas in power generation and increased use of existing generation capacities.
“Although the country maintains a well-diversified mix of energy trade partners, rising import dependence represents a risk amid global energy market volatilities,” the WEF said.

The energy mix, however, remains predominantly carbon intensive, with a low share of clean energy in final demand.
“Improvements in the enabling environment have been driven by political commitment, an ambitious reform agenda, infrastructure investments and a competitive renewable energy landscape,” the WEF said.
On the road ahead, the WEF said in its report that the pace of thermal power plant expansion has considerably slowed in India, though strategies for early retirement or repurposing of the existing fleet will be crucial.
“Continued progress will be challenged by two key macro trends: strong economic growth, and the urgency to create quality jobs for a growing working age population.

“A skilled workforce, public-private collaboration in innovation, and investment in research and development in low-carbon technologies are necessary to enable India’s energy transition,” it added.
Besides India, Singapore is the only other major economy showing “true momentum by advancing sustainability, energy security and equity in a balanced way,” the WEF said.

"Two official teams from India, EU to discuss carbon tax issues",India raised these issues in the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting between the two regions in Brussels in May.,"India and the European Union have constituted two teams to discuss issues pertaining to the EU’s carbon tax, which will kick in from October this year, a government official said.
The European Union (EU) is introducing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from October 1 this year. It would have an impact on seven carbon-intensive sectors, including steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and hydrocarbon products.
India raised these issues in the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting between the two regions in Brussels in May.
In that meeting, the official said, India presented the problems which would be faced by domestic MSMEs due to this tax and also matters related to modalities to comply with that.
“So now they have agreed that there will be a channel opened for discussions. So there will be a team from their side and our side discussing this. The two teams would discuss about the implications of the notification of the EU,” the official, who did not wish to be named, said.
India has suggested the EU to recognise some certifying agencies in India as it would be an expensive affair for a small Indian exporter to take certificates from the EU. India has asked for recognition to its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), which is under preparation.
Issues pertaining to the pricing of carbon-intensive products would also be discussed.

India has already sought exemption for its MSMEs from the European Union’s carbon tax.
According to a report of the think-tank GTRI, CBAM would translate into a 20-35 per cent tax on select imports into the EU starting January 1, 2026.
From October, domestic companies from seven carbon-intensive sectors — including steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and hydrocarbon products — will have to seek compliance certificates from the EU authorities to comply with the CBAM norms.

The commerce ministry held a detailed stakeholders’ consultations meeting on the issue last month and discussed the industry’s preparedness for CBAM compliance.
The compliance is in two parts – a requirement of filing data from October and later imposition of the tax from January 2026.
According to the GTRI (Global Trade Research Initiative) report, from October 1, India’s iron, steel and aluminium exports to European Union countries will face extra scrutiny under the mechanism.
From January 1, 2026, the EU will start collecting carbon tax on each consignment of steel, aluminium, cement, fertiliser, hydrogen and electricity.
In 2022, India’s 27 per cent exports of iron, steel and aluminium products worth USD 8.2 billion went to the EU.

At the multilateral level, India and certain other countries have flagged their concerns to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on CBAM. India submitted a paper on the subject to the WTO in February.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/two-official-teams-india-eu-discuss-carbon-tax-issues-8690269/,business
"Adani family sells $1 billion stake to GQG, other investors","The group's flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd saw 18 million shares, or 1.6 per cent, trade in a single block while the renewable energy firm Adani Green Energy saw a total 35.2 million shares, or 2.2 per cent, change hands.","US-based boutique investment firm GQG Partners and other investors have bought close to USD 1 billion of additional stakes in Adani group companies as billionaire Gautam Adani continues to rebuild market confidence since hit by a damning report of a US short seller.
The investors bought 18 million, or 1.6 per cent, from the Adani family in the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd in a single block trade. In the renewable energy firm Adani Green Energy, a total of 35.2 million shares, or 2.2 per cent, changed hands, sources aware of the matter said.
Stock market data showed large block trades in both companies in early Wednesday trading.
GQG Partners has been ramping up its investment in the conglomerate ever since Hindenburg Research in a bombshell report alleged accounting fraud and stock price manipulation at the Group, triggering a stock market rout that had erased about USD 150 billion in its market value at its lowest point.
Adani Group has denied all allegations by Hindenburg and is plotting a comeback strategy that includes recasting its ambitions, scrapping acquisitions, pre-paying debt to address concerns about its cash flows and borrowings and scaling back its pace of spending on new projects.
In March, promoters sold stakes worth Rs 15,446 crore (USD 1.87 billion) in four group companies to GQG Partners. GQG ramped up that investment with an additional purchase of shares worth USD 400-500 million in May.
GQG investments anchored the Adani group’s recovery from the losses sparked by Hindenburg, though all 10 companies are still trading below the levels before the January 24 report.

Sources said the block trade in Adani Enterprises was transacted at Rs 2,300, a premium to its closing price of Rs 2,281.75 on the BSE on Tuesday. For Adani Green, the trades were priced at Rs 920 to Rs 924.75, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of Rs 959.90.
On Wednesday, Adani Enterprises closed 5.3 per cent higher at Rs 2,403.65 but Adani Green fell as much as 6.8 per cent before erasing most of its losses to trade 0.16 per cent lower at Rs 958.40.
In May, boards of Adani Enterprises Ltd and electricity transmission company Adani Transmission Ltd approved raising up to Rs 21,000 crore (over USD 2.5 billion) through share sales to qualified institutional investors.

This comes after Adani Enterprises was forced to abort a Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering (FPO) in the wake of the Hindenburg report.
The offer was fully subscribed but the company returned the money to subscribers. The sources said the company stock which was offered in the price range of Rs 3,112 to Rs 3,276 in the FPO is now available at a much lower price.
The funds that Adani Group is raising will be used to pare debt as well as fund the group’s expansion projects.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-family-sells-1-bn-stake-ggq-other-investors-8690188/,business
