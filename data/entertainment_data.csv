Karan Johar channels his inner Rajinikanth in new advertisement: ‘The actor within me is so impressed’,"Karan Johar and Kiara Advani featured in a new advertisement for an eyewear brand, which gave Karan an opportunity to flex his acting chops.","Karan Johar reunited with his Lust Stories star Kiara Advani in a new series of advertisements for an eyewear brand. After one commercial in which Kiara play-acted as Karan, going around asking people if they’re dating, a new spot shows Karan channeling his inner Rajinikanth. In the ad, Karan and Kiara are both dressed like a quintessential Rajinikanth character, wearing shirts, vests, and aviator sunglasses.
Karan seems to be having the time of his life delivering the broad performance. One of the most recognisable filmmakers of the country, Karan made a full-fledged acting debut with Anurag Kashyap’s ill-fated 2015 gangster drama Bombay Velvet. He has since joked multiple times about how the movie’s critical and commercial failure killed his acting ambitions. In the new ad, Karan adopts ‘the south Indian superstar look’, and immediately transforms into a dialogue-delivering, scenery chewing showboat.

“Ngl, the actor within me is so impressed,” he wrote in the caption of his Instagram post, sharing the new commercial. “Wooohooo superb,” wrote actor Nandish Sandhu in the comments section. “Woww awesome,” another person commented. Last year, Karan collaborated with Lenskart for a series of ads featuring founder Peyush Bansal. The ads were conceptualised by Tanmay Bhat, Devaiah Bopanna, Deep Joshi, and Vishal Dayama.
Karan and Kiara have worked together on Lust Stories, Good Newwz, and Shershaah. She also appeared on the recently concluded eighth season of his talk show, Koffee with Karan.

"‘Shah Rukh Khan is irreplaceable, actors will come and go’: Karan Johar says era of superstars will end with SRK, Salman","Karan Johar opened up about the blurring lines between movie stardom and online celebrity, and said that nobody can replace his friend Shah Rukh Khan.","Filmmaker Karan Johar declared the the concept of superstardom will cease to exist in the generations that have followed that of the three Khans – Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. He said in an interview that he is biased towards his old friend Shah Rukh, as he described his ‘irreplaceable’ personality. Shah Rukh delivered the three biggest hits of his career in the same calendar year in 2023, reclaiming his position as the country’s biggest star.
Karan has often spoken about the kind of allure that movie stars used to have, and told Forbes that he finds this quality lacking in the actors that have followed. He said, “There is no concept, according to me, of superstardom post the era of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. I feel now there’ll be the age of the actors.”

Karan said that the idea of celebrity has also evolved, because there are so many different ways in which one can become popular these days. “At one point, celebrity meant a movie star or cricketer. But today, a celebrity can be an Instagrammer or a food vlogger, a fashion influencer or a great author. The lines have blurred. But the nation’s crazy love for Shah Rukh, Salman Aamir, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn… Even Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji, Kajol… When Rani and Kajol came on Koffee with Karan, I could tell the equity they carried because they come from a legacy of 25 years.”
Karan added, “Even now, when Rekha walks into an event, heads turn. That’s a movie star. When Aishwarya walks the red carpet at Cannes, when Mr Bachchan is anywhere, they’re movie stars. That mania, that magic is very tough to create in this generation of noise.” Highlighting Shah Rukh, Karan declared, “I don’t think there’s a better conversationalist, a more intelligent mind, a more charming and arresting persona, and an aura that is inexplicable than Shah Rukh Khan. That majestic magnetism only he has. He’s irreplaceable.”
Karan said that there will be ‘many actors’ in the future, but ‘there never was and never will be a personality like Shah Rukh Khan’. Karan and Shah Rukh have worked together on films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and My Name is Khan.

In an interview with Siddharth Kanna, Varun was asked about moving on. He said, “I think moving on is a bit difficult. But I can forgive thinking that what happened might have been destined. You can’t feel bad about ‘Oh, this happened to me.’ If something bad has happened to you, then leave it to fate and karma.”
He continued, “I think I am naive but I am not street smart is not right, because I am. Being an outsider, I have figured out things on my own. But yes, I am naive; I believe people easily.

Guntur Kaaram box office collection Day 6: Mahesh Babu’s masala fare crosses Rs 150 crore-mark worldwide,Guntur Kaaram box office collection Day 6: Mahesh Babu's third collaboration with Trivikram Srinivas has seen a drop in collections as it goes past Rs 100 crore mark domestically.,"On Tuesday (Day 5), Mahesh Babu’s latest release Guntur Kaaram crossed the Rs 150 crore mark worldwide, and on Day 6, it breached the Rs 100-crore mark on home ground. According to Sacnilk, the film has earned Rs 100.95 crore from Indian box offices. However, with the Sankranti holiday season coming to a close, footfalls have dropped by more than 30 percent. On Day 5, the box office collection of the film was around Rs 11 crore, which has come down to Rs 6 crore on Day 6. The slide is expected to continue till the weekend.

The film is also facing tough competition from HanuMan, starring Teja Sajja, which on Day 6 has earned around Rs 80 crore, a huge number given the relatively new star cast.
Guntur Kaaram marks the third collaboration of Mahesh Babu and director Trivikram Srinivas, who have earlier made blockbusters like Athadu and Businessman. While the previous ventures became milestones in Mahesh Babu’s career, Guntur Kaaram falls short of creating such a legacy despite the considerable success at the box office.

Anandu Suresh of Indian Express rated the film two stars, and wrote, “Mahesh Babu, in top-notch form, is the sole redeeming factor in Trivikram’s unnecessarily stretched Guntur Kaaram, preventing it from becoming a tedious watch.”
Also starring Sreeleela, Meenakshi Chaudhry, Ramya Krishnan, Jayaram, Prakash Raj, and Jagapati Babu in important roles. S Thaman has composed music for the film, with cinematography by Manoj Paramahamsa and Nirav Shah.

"After Dharma creative head’s criticism of Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Karan Johar praises 12th Fail: ‘Passed the test with flying colours’","Karan Johar opened up about the kind of films that will be difficult to sell in the theatrical marketplace, and said that 12th Fail is an exception to the norm.","Filmmaker Karan Johar opened up about the return to form that theatrical Hindi films experienced in 2023, and dissected the new learnings that the industry is taking a stock of as it evolves. Karan said that the sort of films that would do very well in the 1990s don’t really have an audience in theatres any more, but highlighted outliers like 12th Fail, the drama film that defied the odds to emerge as a word-of-mouth success late last year.
In an interview with Forbes, Karan was asked about how he views the business, and he said, “Theatres are overflowing with love, and the cinematic experience is back. But the digital medium is equally strong, and the digital revolution remains. This isn’t the rule, but there are some genres and sub-genres that are more celluloid friendly.”

Citing the example of an exception to the norm, Karan continued, “12th Fail just passed the test with flying colours. To anybody’s mind, that might have seemed like a great digital film, but it turned out to be a solid commercial success. Well done to the team and to Vinod Chopra, who’s such a veteran.” He added, “The tent pole films, the big cinematic experiences are more for the cinemas. And genres like dramedies or family comedies, or suspense thrillers are more tough to sell theatrically. The films that defined our 90s and early 2000s, those films are not easy to sell today.” Recently, the creative head of Karan’s Dharma Productions, Somen Mishra, chose to criticise 12th Fail director Vidhu Vinod Chopra for not crediting his writers appropriately.
This is why, Karan said, there are a lot of crime thrillers and romantic comedies being made for streaming platforms. “There is a clear divide, but there will always be exceptions to that rule,” Karan said. Asked if the industry has become more data driven, Karan said, “We have research models, we also have organisations like Ormax that predict opening numbers. You can get an indication, but there’s always that magic that you can’t predict.”
Karan admitted that filmmakers tell him not to rob them of their instincts, but his response is to remind them that they aren’t in it alone, and have a responsibility to the person footing the bills. “It’s not your money in the game. We are a balance of commerce and art. If you make a film for yourself, with your passion and your desire to tell a story, do it, but please do it with your own money,” he said.

Alia Bhatt gave no response when cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee gave her instructions during Gangubai Kathiawadi: ‘Wouldn’t know if she heard me’,Cinematographer  Sudeep Chatterjee said that he couldn't figure out if Alia Bhatt had heard him when he gave her instructions for a scene in Gangubai Kathiawadi.,"Alia Bhatt is known as one of the best actors of her generation and in a recent interview, cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee spoke about his collaboration with Alia in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Gangubai Kathiawadi. Sudeep said that cinematographers have to form a relationship with the actors so they can get the best out of a given scene. He recalled that while shooting a scene for Gangubai Kathiawadi, he could not decipher if Alia had even heard his instructions as she did not react at all but her performance said otherwise.
He shared with Film Companion, “With Alia, when I give her an instruction… Initially, I used to say that there is no response. I wouldn’t know whether she has heard me or not. But she would do it to the point.” He then recalled a scene from the film where Seema Pahwa’s Sheela is performing with Alia’s Gangubai and is trying to suck her into her brothel.
“There was one sequence where she is being trapped into the brothel and Sheela mausi is holding her face. I left a small slit of sunlight on her face. The light is almost a symbolism of her hope, her dignity, her pride, everything. And she would really want to cling on to that. In my mind, she would try to move towards the light and Sheela mausi would keep on dragging her to the darkness,” he shared.

Sudeep said that he wondered if he should share this with Alia so she could move her face accordingly and they could achieve the desired effect. “I thought maybe if I tell this to her, and it was early in the shoot, I said if I tell this to her, she can help me in achieving this. When I told her, I didn’t realise that she had even realised what I had said and she… But you see that scene and see what she does. Then after the take, she came and asked me that ‘could I manage?’ I was so happy,” he said.
Alia Bhatt was widely praised for her work in Gangubai Kathiawadi. The actor will next be seen in Vasan Bala’s next Jigra.

Orry, who is frequently photographed with Kajol and Ajay Devgn’s daughter Nysa Devgn, recalled his first encounter with Kajol when the film star refused to have a photo with him.
Orry shared that many years ago, when he was still living as a student in New York, he managed to ‘hustle’ his way into the position of an usher for an event which was being attended by Kajol. “I was usher number 3 to Kajol and she probably doesn’t know this. This was in New York at the Taj Pierre, she was speaking at it and she kept talking about how children should wash their hands. This was pre-Covid and she was giving this speech,” he said.

Orry then said that he asked her security for a “humble photo and I was declined.” Karan then pointed out the “great irony” as Orry and Nysa share a close friendship and are often seen holidaying together. “Who knew that one day down the years you would be in a million photos with her daughter Nysa?” he said and added, “Life comes a full circle.”
During his appearance on the episode, Orry spoke about his ’15 minutes of fame’ and said he is now planning his ‘downfall’. “Yes, the fame is getting to my head. Yes, I have an attitude problem. I think I’m better than everyone. But I am planning my own downfall now. Anything that goes up must go down, the brightest stars burn the fastest,” he said and added, “Then, the 15 minutes will be up. And then, we’ll plan a comeback. Karan, in a movie, every lead goes up, and then they have to have a fall, and then they have a comeback. My fall is coming.”

Anand Mahindra wasn’t behind, as he took to X and penned a long note for the film, talking about it in detail and calling for the National Awards for Vikrant Massey.
“Finally saw ‘12th FAIL’ over this past weekend. If you see only ONE film this year, make it this one. Why? (1) Plot: This story is based on real-life heroes of the country. Not just the protagonist, but the millions of youth, hungry for success, who struggle against extrordinary odds to pass what is arguably one of the most competitive exams in the world.
(2) Acting: @VidhuChopraa does a brilliant job of the casting. Each character is credible in the role & they turn in gritty, passionate performances. But @VikrantMassey delivers a bravura performance that merits a National Film Award. He was not just acting out the character’s life, he was living it,” a part of his tweet read.

Samantha admitted that her choices were influenced by her ex-partner, and she struggled to figure out her true likes and dislikes. The actor was previously married to Naga Chaitanya.
Samantha penned a long and thoughtful reply to the question which read, “If personal growth had a highlight reel, what would be the ‘blooper’ you laugh about now, and what’s the ‘Oscar-worthy’ moment where you nailed a major life lesson?”
She replied, “Perhaps the most significant mistake was my failure to understand my own likes and dislikes, as they were constantly influenced by the partner I had during that period. On the other hand, my moment of immense personal growth occurred when I recognized that even during the most difficult times, there was a valuable lesson to be learnt.”
Naga Chaitanya and Samantha dated for four years before getting married in 2017. However, the couple announced their separation in 2021. The ex-couple had said in a statement, “After much deliberation and thought Sam and I have decided to part ways as husband and wife to pursue our own paths.

He also revealed that he has three doppelgangers who fill in for him when he's not available.","Internet sensation Orry looked back on his meteoric rise to fame, and said that everybody should blame none other than film producer Boney Kapoor for it. Orry is close friends with Boney’s daughters, actors Khushi and Janhvi Kapoor, whom he described as his sister and guru, respectively. Appearing on the season eight finale of Koffee with Karan, Orry opened up about his fame, and how he plans on circumventing any loss of relevance.
He said that he is able to be ‘omnipresent’ because he actually has three doppelgangers that he deploys to hold the fort at events until he arrives himself. He said, “I am everywhere, and I take great pride in being Orry the omnipresent. But sometimes, people forget that I’m not actually a mystical creature, and I can’t actually be everywhere. So, we do have the lookalikes that have to be sent out to hold the fort until I arrive. So, there will be an Orry lookalike who’ll be at the event, and you’ll think it’s me for the first 20 minutes, till I actually get from Nariman Point to BKC… We all wear the same outfit, we have the same look. They just won’t talk, because the minute they talk, it goes away.”

Asked if he remembers the first time he felt famous, Orry said that it was Boney Kapoor, whose name he kept pronouncing as ‘Bonnie’, who first introduced him to the Mumbai paparazzi. Orry joked that he probably owes him a cheque now, considering how lucrative his brand has become. He said, “If you want to blame someone, blame Boney Kapoor. Blame him. Because the first time I got the limelight, it was his fault. I was attending his daughter’s birthday, and when I entered the gate, the media was like, click, click, click… And Boney uncle, being the gentleman that he is, had come down to receive me.”
Orry continued, “I was so shy, I was shaking. I told him, ‘Boney uncle, they were calling my name’. And he was like, ‘Did you pose?’ And I said I didn’t. He grabbed me by the wrist and flung me in front of the media, and said, ‘Yeh Orry hai, iska photo lo, yeh mera bachcha hai (This is Orry, he’s like my son, take his picture)’. The match was always there, and so was the gunpowder, and Boney just lit it. And now I’m on Koffee, so I should write him a cheque.” Karan joked that Boney would probably like it.

She will be next seen in Stree 2, the sequel to her hit 2018 film which Amar-Kaushik directed. The film is scheduled to release in theatres in August 2024.

The guests were also the jury for the Koffee awards where they voted on some of the best moments and performances of the season. Karan casually admitted that he is Poo while giving out the ‘best moment’ award from this season to Rani Mukerji and Kajol.
The rapid fire round, that’s often seen as the most entertaining bit of the episode, was one of the award categories and the ‘Best rapid fire’ was shared by two celebrities – Saif Ali Khan and Ananya Panday. He called Ananya who was rather surprised as she did not win the rapid fire round during her episode with Sara Ali Khan. “I’d like to thank a certain ‘boy Kapur’ for that,” she said.

Orry said that he is pre-empting his loss of relevance, and is currently in the process of planning own digital ‘demise’. He said that like the hero of a movie, he will rise up from the ashes in a strategic manner.
To help him plan his life, Orry said, he has a team of ‘minions’ who work in the ‘relevance room’ at the ‘Orry office’.

Yes, I have an attitude problem. I think I’m better than everyone. But I am planning my own downfall now. Anything that goes up must go down, the brightest stars burn the fastest,” he said.

Jayaram: The actor whom Malayalam cinema betrayed many times but was saved by other film industries,"Facing consecutive box office failures in Malayalam in the last decade, Jayaram became one of those actors one could not bet on. But now, he has made a comeback to his home turf, through Midhun Manuel Thomas' Abraham Ozler.","A debut film (Aparan) still hailed as one of the finest mystery thrillers in Malayalam; a filmography filled with numerous blockbusters; several movies revisited by countless viewers to this day; a skilled master in handling slapstick, situational and physical comedy with impeccable timing and exceptional dialogue delivery. Yet, Jayaram stands out as one of the rare Malayalam superstars whose career took a significant downturn at one point.
Facing consecutive box office failures in the last decade, each of which was panned by both audiences and critics alike, Jayaram became one of those actors one could not bet on. From starring in around 10-15 films annually, with most enjoying success, Jayaram hit rock bottom, experiencing no releases in Malayalam in 2020, 2021 or 2023 and just one film in 2022 (Sathyan Anthikad’s Makal).

"At 40, the Sundance Film Festival celebrates its past and looks to the future","Sundance programmers culled through 17,435 submissions to arrive at the 83 feature films playing across the 10 days, featuring a diverse mix of behind-the-camera talent.","Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck remember the feeling of being the new kids at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2004, they’d come to Park City, Utah, armed with a short film Gowanus, Brooklyn, some homemade promotional postcards and dreams of breaking through. Their short not only won a prize that year but also enough support to make the feature version, Half Nelson, which would later earn Ryan Gosling his first Oscar nomination.
“I remember being like, oh my God, this festival has been around 20 years, it’s such an old festival,” Boden said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. “Now it’s 20 years later and we’re the old people.”
Of course, “old” is relative when it comes to a discovery festival like Sundance, where directors fresh out of film school can get a shot at a breakthrough. Remember, Kevin Smith was just 23 when he brough Clerks to Park City. Like many of their contemporaries that started at Sundance — including Steven Soderbergh, who is also coming with a new film, Presence — Boden and Fleck have gone on to bigger projects, including Captain Marvel.

Their new film debuts Thursday, opening night of the 40th edition of the festival, at the storied Eccles Theater. Freaky Tales is a love letter to Fleck’s hometown, Oakland, in the 1980s — its sports, music, history and the movies of the time — featuring Pedro Pascal, Jay Ellis, Dominique Thorne and Ben Mendelsohn.
“It’s a movie lover’s movie,” Boden teased. “It has one foot in reality and then one foot just launches off into fantasy.”
The first day also boasts the world premieres of several high-profile documentaries, including Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine’s Girls State, Yance Ford’s Power and Frida, directed by Emmy-nominated editor Carla Gutiérrez, and playing in the U.S. documentary competition.
As an immigrant and a former art student, Gutiérrez has long admired Frida Kahlo. In Frida, she uses Kahlo’s words from her diary, letters and essays to let the artist tell her own story.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Uncovering her own words and her own voice, I think what we’re presenting is a new way of getting into her world and in her mind and her heart and really understanding the art in a more intimate, raw way,” Gutiérrez said.
Other anticipated documentaries playing across various sections include Daughters, about four young girls reuniting with their incarcerated fathers at a dance, Gaucho Gaucho, from The Truffle Hunters filmmakers, Sue Bird: In the Clutch, DEVO, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, Seeking Mavis Beacon, and The Greatest Night in Pop, featuring never-before-seen footage about the making of We Are The World. The programmers are also predicting that Will & Harper, about a road trip Will Ferrell takes with his friend of 30 years who has come out as a trans woman, will be a big crowd pleaser.
As always, an army of celebrities are expected to descend on Park City, including Kristen Stewart, with two buzzy films (Love Me and Love Lies Bleeding), Saoirse Ronan, Kieran Culkin, Sebastian Stan, Glen Powell, Woody Harrelson, Steven Yeun, Lucy Liu, Danielle Deadwyler, Aubrey Plaza, Melissa Barrera and Laura Linney.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is also bringing his sophomore feature, Rob Peace, a biographical drama about the tragically short life of a brilliant kid from East Orange, New Jersey, which he wrote, directed and co-stars in alongside Jay Will, Mary J. Blige and Camila Cabello.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’ve been fortunate to be there many times as an actor and a director as well,” Ejiofor said. “It’s a dream to take this film there as well. It’s an American story, it’s an independent film and it wants to sit in that world.”
Sundance programmers culled through 17,435 submissions to arrive at the 83 feature films playing across the 10 days, featuring a diverse mix of behind-the-camera talent. There are new episodic projects from Debra Granik and Richard Linklater, as well as 31 feature debuts.
Gutiérrez is one of those first-time directors, as is Titus Kaphar, an acclaimed contemporary artist and MacArthur Fellow who is making his narrative debut with the competition title Exhibiting Forgiveness. Featuring André Holland and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Kaphar uses his own paintings to tell this very personal story of an artist who is visited by his estranged father (John Earl Jelks). He wanted to find a way to talk to his children about his life experience and examine generational trauma in a new medium, and he’s honored to have the festival’s support.
“My favorite films are Sundance films,” Kaphar said. “To be allowed into this new community of artists, a community of directors and filmmakers … it’s pretty extraordinary.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The excitement isn’t lost on Sundance mainstays like Jesse Eisenberg, who has been going to the festival since The Squid and the Whale. This year, he’s bringing a film that he’s been wanting to make for almost as long. In A Real Pain, which he wrote and directed, he plays an American who travels to Poland with his cousin (Culkin) to see where their late grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, was from.
“It’s about how we kind of view modern pain versus historical pain, but not in a didactic way. I didn’t want the movie to feel like homework,” Eisenberg said. “I wanted it to feel funny and light and only contemplative like that in retrospect.”
And everyone has different ways of experiencing their films at Sundance. Boden and Fleck are especially looking forward to a “raucous” crowd at the Eccles. Eisenberg will probably step out when the lights go down — he knows from experience that it makes him too anxious.
“My nerves are a little redirected towards hoping people like it in a kind of holistic way, rather than just my acting,” said Eisenberg. He also appears in another highly anticipated film: Sasquatch Sunset, from David and Nathan Zellner, in which he and Riley Keough are unrecognizable as a family of, yes, sasquatches.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Robert Redford-founded festival is, mostly, forward thinking — but they are taking some time to appreciate the art that has come out of Sundance over four decades. Just take a look at the “all-time top 10” released Tuesday, voted on by more than 500 filmmakers, critics, and industry members. The list of classics includes: Joel and Ethan Coen’s Blood Simple (10th), Soderbergh’s sex, lies and videotape (sixth), Jordan Peele’s Get Out (third) and Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash (first).
The question now is what will pop from the 2024 festival. Will audiences see the next Before Sunrise, Memento, “Y tu mamá también, Little Miss Sunshine, or Reservoir Dogs, and other films that have transcended their humble indie roots to become all-time classics? Will there be another Oscar nominee, or winner?
Festival director Eugene Hernandez noted a vibrancy in the lineup that reminded him of his earliest days going to the festival, in the 1990s.
“It’s such a rich, rich combination of films that I that I think exhibit some really wild and adventurous creativity,” Hernandez said. “That is really nourishing in a year when we’re acknowledging and marking this 40th edition of Sundance.”
The Sundance Film Festival runs from January 18 through January 28.

In a chat with Film Companion, Sudeep spoke about the scene after the Indian team wins the World Cup and the players rush on to the field, and and emotional Kabir Khan is standing on the edge on the field. “That moment is actually a very sad moment because all the glory and the victory belongs to the girls and he is the one in the background, very few people will even know about his contribution. For me, that was the truth of the scene,” he said.

When Prahlad Kakkar made Paintal literally put his head in a lion’s mouth by getting him drunk on rum,"Prahlad Kakkar recalled working on a series of ad films in the 70s, one of which required actor to put his head in a lion's mouth.","Ad guru Prahlad Kakkar recalled a campaign that he spearheaded in the 1970s, which involved putting the comedic actor Paintal‘s head literally inside a lion’s mouth. Of course, the actor wasn’t particularly excited to do this, but Prahlad narrated the story of how he got him to agree, and the darkly humorous interaction that he had with the client behind the campaign.
In a chat with Cyrus Broacha on the sidelines of the launch of his autobiography, one of Prahlad’s old colleagues brought up the lion story, and said, “I don’t know if you remember this, but in 1977 or 78, you were doing an ad for Bush radios. Prahlad needed a guy to come and play with a lion, so Prahlad hires this lion, brings him into the studio, and makes him sit on a chair. And then he gets this comedian to talk to the lion, and he tells the comedian – I can’t remember his name – that he has to put his head in the lion’s mouth.”

The film, which was released on Netflix after its theatrical run, was taken down by the OTT platform after it faced backlash from a few Hindu outfits.

"Jimmy Shergill says cutting his hair as a Sikh teenager was wrong, his parents didn’t speak to him for 1.5 years: ‘You call it a mistake, incident, or accident’",Jimmy Shergill opened up about his life and shared that his parents were terribly upset with him after he cut his hair.,"Jimmy Shergill made his film debut with Maachis but it was his appearance in Aditya Chopra’s Mohabbatein that made him a household name. Soon after the release of Mohabbatein, Jimmy started to get known for his boy-next-door charm but for him, he wanted to do more than appear in those ‘chocolate boy’ roles. In a recent interview, Jimmy said that he even returned the signing amount of a few producers because he wanted to take up varied projects instead of appearing in similar roles.
Jimmy said that even though people were telling him to capitalise on his charm, he wanted to move on because he could see that the same kind of roles won’t serve him for a long time. “After working a lot for the first two years, I returned the signing amount to a lot of people because I wanted to do something different. Because this chocolate boy thing was a little too much at the time. Everybody would say ‘why? This is amazing’ and I would say ‘no, there is something inside me telling me that this won’t last for more than 2-3 years’. So I knew that I needed to look for… that’s where films like Munna Bhai, Haasil, Yahaan, these films came to me,” he shared with Bollywood Bubble and added, “These gave a different image and never let you get stuck into one particular image.”

Lata Mangeshkar had to bail broke BCCI out by hosting fundraiser concert for World Cup winning team of 1983: Rajeev Shukla,"MP Rajeev Shukla spoke about seeking advice from Shah Rukh Khan, and recalled an anecdote about how Lata Mangeshkar came to the BCCI's rescue during difficult times.","Rajya Sabha MP and vice-president of the BCCI, Rajeev Shukla spoke about his friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. In an interview, he recalled the advice that Shah Rukh gave him about giving acting a shot. He said that over the years, several filmmakers have approached him to play small roles in movies, but Shah Rukh once advised him to stick to what he’s good at. He also narrated an anecdote about the late singer Lata Mangeshkar coming to the BCCI’s rescue after the board was unable to pay members of the World Cup winning team of 1983.
Shukla spoke with YouTuber Samdish Bhatia for the Unfiltered by Samdish channel, where he was asked about his rolodex of famous friends, one of whom happens to be Shah Rukh. “A few directors have offered me roles, but I refused to do them. It’s not about liking or disliking the field of acting, but sometimes you’re forced to fit into certain roles, and there’s no fun in doing them. Recently, another filmmaker offered me the role of a politician in their film, and I asked Shah Rukh about it. He said, ‘Rajeev ji, that isn’t your job’. He’s the biggest star we have, so of course I’d ask him. If he’s ever offered to become an MP, he’d ask me.”

She said that she maintains a friendship with Govinda, and praised him as being the most talented actor of his generation. Govinda has experienced a drastic decline in stardom in the last decade, and has often implied that there is a conspiracy afoot to harm his career.
In an interview with The Lallantop, Raveena was asked about her streak of hits with Govinda, called Chi Chi by his friends, and his apparent fall from grace. Pushing back on the suggestion, she said, “The kind of films where Chi Chi’s talent can be perfectly used aren’t being made any more. I don’t think this industry has ever seen an actor as talented as Chi Chi. I have never seen an actor who can make the audience laugh and cry in the same scene. I was in awe of him. He could transform a comedic scene into an emotional one so effortlessly. Everything I know about comic timing I’ve learned from him. Nobody can compare to him.”

"Javed Akhtar busts myths about Urdu being a Muslim language: ‘If Hindi belongs to Hindus, try telling that to Tamilians and see what happens’",Javed Akhtar spoke about the divisions that are being created in society by implying that Hindi and Urdu belong to separate religions.,"Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar broke misconceptions around Hindi and Urdu, and said at an event that it would be incorrect to assume that one is the language of Hindus and the other of Muslims. He said that language emerges from region not religion, and that Urdu is as much a Hindustani language as Hindi. He also said that it is unfair to blame governments over the years for the erasure of the Urdu script, because the people who are consider themselves to be the custodians of their culture haven’t done their part in imparting this knowledge to younger generations.
Javed Akhtar appeared for a discussion about Hindi and Urdu being “Siamese twins” at the India International Centre, shared on the foundation’s YouTube channel. “Hindi and Urdu were equals until about 200 years ago, when, for political reasons, they were separated,” he said. “You would not be able to tell if certain poems were written by a Hindi poet or an Urdu poet. This was done by the Britishers to create a cultural difference in north India.”

"Sandeep Reddy Vanga mocks award shows, says nepotism is a result of ‘animal-like mindset’: ‘Don’t want to cry like a baby’","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga said that he experienced animal-like hostility from the film industry, which felt threatened by his presence and 'rebelled' against him.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who recently experienced the biggest success of his career with his controversial film Animal, said that the film industry is hostile towards outsiders like himself. Citing the example of awards shows, Vanga said that the industry is more interested in promoting its own rather than welcoming outsiders with fresh ideas. Starring Ranbir Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Anil Kapoor, Animal was released in theatres last month.
In an interview with Dainik Bhaskar, Vanga said that he doesn’t want to sound like he’s complaining too much, which is why he has chosen to remain quiet about the things he has experienced in the industry. “It’s literally like animal behaviour, you rebel against anybody who threatens to enter your territory,” he said.

"Dhanush was seen as ‘odd’ when Aanand L Rai cast him in Raanjhana, director recalls: ‘A 6 foot tall, fair boy was seen as a hero’",Aanand L Rai said that the decision to cast Dhanush was met with some resistance as people saw his as 'odd'.,"Dhanush, who was recently seen in Captain Miller, made his debut in Hindi movies way before the concept of pan-Indian films became big in India. Back in 2013, Dhanush played a lead role in Aanand L Rai’s Raanjhanaa and while the actor was a force to be reckoned with in the Tamil industry, the Hindi film audience wasn’t very familiar with his work. In a recent interview, Rai shared that his decision to cast Dhanush in the movie was met with some opposition as “people saw him as odd”. Primarily, this was because the northern part of the country saw heroes as having certain physical attributes and Dhanush did not fall in that category.
The filmmaker told Mashable India, “We have an image for a hero which is slowly changing now. But at that time, in 2012-23… in the north, a 6 foot tall, fair boy was seen as a hero. That was the image. In such a world, Dhanush, who was a star in south, but here, people saw him as odd. But when you see him in the film and when he performs, there is no one more appealing than him.”

A few months ago, Pugazh and Kuraishi performed at a cultural event in Dubai. During their performance, Kuraishi mimicked Haasan and answered questions posed by Pugazh.

Maya had acted with Haasan in the film Vikram, and it was alleged that was the reason behind the actor’s bias.

For Shah Rukh Khan, Boman wondered how many hours does the man sleep as he has spent enough time working with King Khan but has never managed to solve that mystery.

He is very into his tandoori chicken and he is happy, he is content. He doesn’t think of fancy food as a way to make himself happy,” he told Connect FM Canada and added, “I have spent the whole night sitting and chatting with him. I am a mess the next morning, he is not. It’s amazing.”

"Ek Hasina Thi: A promising Sriram Raghavan film gets derailed in first act, Urmila Matondkar-Saif Ali Khan romance didn’t age well","20 years of Ek Hasina Thi: The Urmila Matondkar and Saif Ali Khan film is shot well and performed well, but where are the twists and turns that make a mainstream thriller palpable?","“Some classics do date,” film director Sriram Raghavan once said. I watched the celebrated filmmaker’s debut feature film Ek Hasina Thi, which is counted among the best thrillers produced by Hindi cinema and I cannot agree with him more. Undoubtedly, the Urmila Matondkar and Saif Ali Khan film is shot well and performed well, but where are the twists and turns that make a mainstream thriller palpable?
Given my experience with the filmmaker’s Badlapur (2015) and Andhadhun (2018), both of which had me on the edge, breathlessly waiting to find out what happens next. So, I jumped up when the chance to watch Ek Hasina Thi came, expecting a lot of chills and a bit of anxiety. Instead, during the 137 minutes of Ek Hasina Thi, there were times I controlled the urge to pick up the remote and forward it a bit, perks that come with the streaming platforms (Yes, go ahead, question me and my generation for our limited attention spans and diminished patience levels).

Why Vijay Sethupathi being Vijay Sethupathi in all his films makes him a great actor,"While talking about Vijay Sethupathi, the term 'versatility' is widely used. However, in reality, the actor retains a sense of sameness in his variety, and it only makes him unique rather than redundant.","Method acting or ‘getting under the skin of a character’ is not something you see a lot in Indian cinema. More often than not, all our heroes, especially stars, are pretty much themselves in all their films. Vijay and Leo are identical to Leo and Parthiban. Rajinikanth in Jailer is not all that different from Petta. At best, we get to see different looks of the same person. Rajinikanth was honest when he said at the Ponniyin Selvan 1 audio launch that he just has a set of templates. That’s pretty much the ‘method’ of all the actors. Interestingly, being himself in all of his films is what makes Vijay Sethupathi original. It is an irony that here’s an actor who remains himself in all of his films, and we love him for it.
For some reason, Sethupathi doesn’t have to do much. Take the scene in Sriram Raghavan’s Merry Christmas where he is in the neighbourhood gift shop. The owner recognises and asks him if he is Albert. Sethupathi doesn’t do much other than a gentle nod. She then goes, “You have returned from Dubai?” Nod. “How is Dubai?” He finally opens up, “Too many rules.” He has actually come from jail. In another instance, he is bewildered by the actions of the other lead character, and all he does is look at her perplexed in the lift. For a Tamil audience, they have seen Sethupathi cut that look so many times, but it is hard to get enough of it. It is lovely to watch Vijay Sethupathi doing Vijay Sethupathi things.

In an interview with Hindustan Times, Raveena opened up about why she had to reject Aarya. She said, “While these were really exciting scripts, but somewhere I wanted to do something that the audience have never got a chance to see me as before.

"BTS members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook enter military: BigHit Music","BigHit Music expressed gratitude towards ARMY as RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook have entered the military for mandatory service.","BigHit Music, the management agency of South Korean music septet BTS, on Monday said members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook have entered the military for mandatory service and will soon perform their duties at the training camp.
Jin, the oldest BTS member, enlisted in 2022, followed by J-hope last April. Suga, the third member, started his service in September 2023.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.

The remaining four members — RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook — initiated the enlistment process in November 2023. In a statement shared on fan community forum Weverse, BigHit Music expressed gratitude towards ARMY, the fan group of the band, for supporting BTS over the years.
“Thanks to your kind consideration and support this past December, BTS members RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook have entered the military and will soon be performing their duties at the training camp. Thank you for your interest and support on their enlistment day,” the agency said in the statement.
BigHit Music also appealed to fans to refrain from sending gifts to the serving members as it could lead to problems with storage and even misplacement.
“The military barracks are communal spaces shared by military personnel for training together. If a large number of letters and gifts from the fans arrive at the center all at once, it would be difficult to store them and they could be easily lost. Therefore, we kindly ask that fans refrain from sending anything by mail,” it said.

Fans can instead send messages for the artists on Weverse, added BigHit Music. The agency also asked for ARMY’s cooperation during the members recruit training graduation ceremony.
“In order to prevent any issues that might occur from crowding, we ask fans to please refrain from visiting the site. Instead, we ask you to keep your heartwarming words of support and farewell in your hearts. We ask for your continued love and support for the BTS members until they complete their service and return. Our company will also strive to provide every support they need during this time.”
BTS, which debuted in 2013, had announced their hiatus in June 2022. The members hope to reconvene as a unit around 2025 following their service commitment.
In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18-28 are required to serve in the military for about two years. All BTS members were allowed to put off starting their military service until they turned 30.

Sunny Kaushal says challenges faced by Katrina Kaif and his mom Veena Kaushal can’t be compared: ‘They come from different worlds’,"Sunny Kaushal opened up about the two significant women in his life — sister-in-law Katrina Kaif and mom Veena Kaushal, emphasising that their challenges and experiences cannot be compared.","Bollywood actor Sunny Kaushal shares a close bond with his mother Veena Kaushal and maintains a good rapport with his sister-in-law, actor Katrina Kaif. In a recent interview, Sunny opened up about the two significant women in his life, emphasizing that their challenges and experiences cannot be compared.
In a conversation with Bollywood Bubble, Sunny was asked about any similarities he sees in the challenges faced by his mother and Katrina. He responded, “I can’t compare mom and Katrina that way because mom’s world has always been small. It was limited to me, Vicky (Vicky Kaushal) and dad (Sham Kaushal) and her siblings. She has always found happiness in that. Whereas Katrina, because of the work she does, because in this profession you travel so much, you meet so many people…so comparing them would not be the ideal answer in this situation. They both come from very different worlds and they have seen different worlds. To ask if they have any similarities? I don’t know and that’s my answer.”

Ankita Lokhande shares startling details from conversation with mother-in-law: ‘Aapki aukat kya hai?’,"During the latest Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Ankita Lokhande unveiled startling revelations from her conversation with her mother-in-law, Ranjana Jain, who made a brief appearance in the house.","Ankita Lokhande and husband Vicky Jain’s tumultuous relationship within the Bigg Boss house have become a focal point in recent headlines. During the latest Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Ankita unveiled shocking revelations from her conversation with her mother-in-law, Ranjana Jain, who made a brief appearance in the house.
In the previous episode, it was disclosed that Vicky’s father had contacted Ankita’s mother, Vandana Lokhande, following an incident where Ankita threw a slipper at Vicky, questioning if she would show the same behavior towards her late husband. Ankita further delved into the contentious discussion with Vicky.
“Do you trust me?” she asked Vicky before they started the discussion. “Meri mummy ko papa (Vicky’s father) ne phone kiya tha (You father called my mother). (He asked) ‘Aap aapke pati ko aisi maarti thi kya chappal jute phek ke?’ Papa ne aur bhi bola tha. (He said) ‘Aapki aukat kya hai? (Did you throw chappals at your late husband? He said more. He told my mom, ‘What is your worth?)’ I politely told mummy that she was alone, my papa recently passed away. I genuinely felt guilty and apologised to her. Later, my mom revealed that papa had told her many other things. But I asked her to not bring this up,” Ankita told Vicky.

In his response, Vicky defended his father’s actions and said, “What would your father have said? He wouldn’t have liked it. He would have expressed it in some way. Is this different or the same feeling?”
Vicky’s father did not only said “aap apne pati ko bhi aise marti thi kya” but also “aapki aukat kya hai” and many more harsh things to a woman who just lost her husband.
This is cruelty and absurdity. I’m so irritated with Vicky’s family drama !!#AnkitaLokhande #BiggBoss17 pic.twitter.com/G6VY3MHcV2

He further expressed how his family is being shows as ‘egoistic rich people’ through the show. “I feel they are trying to portray Vicky and his family as rich egoistic people and Ankita’s family is taking all the sufferings. She is still balancing it and taking all the harsh things on herself,” he said.

Though Ankita tried to put her point, assuring that nobody is trying to portray Vicky’s family negatively, Vicky refused the same and said. “Did you ever see this, even after everything happened in the therapy room?” Ankita asked to which Vicky replied, “Sach kya hai Ankita? Aapko kya lagta hai? (What is the truth? What do you think is right?)”
In an attempt to take confirmation from Ankita, Vicky asked her, “Does my family interfere in your career, in our life or what you wear and how you live?” Ankita denied but added, “Our mothers haven’t seen us like this so it must be affecting them. I have earned a lot of respect and love in your house. I don’t want to lose that because of these fights. That is why I have been apologising. I am ready to say sorry 1000 times.”
Ankita and Vicky have been married for over two year. The couple dated for a few years before tying the knot in December 2021. Ankita was previously in a relationship with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.

If Katrina Kaif walks up to you and cries about her crisis, you will believe her. She is gifted with a face that is painted with innocence. For when she cries, Katrina’s eyes–which become amusingly tinier as her cheeks lift and tears start to form- ask for absolute submission. But in Merry Christmas, her sincerity is blended in the whacky mixer grinder of Sriram Raghavan, in whose world you are innocent only when someone else is proven guilty. The thriller cooks up a question: Will you trust what you see, even if Katrina is asking you to?

"Shilpa Shetty wants Indian women actors to do characters like Gal Gadot, Scarlett Johansson: ‘We are still in a male-dominated society…’","Shilpa Shetty, who is set to star as a cop in Rohit Shetty's maiden OTT series Indian Police Force, said she would love to have a scenario where women in India can also portray characters like Gal Gadot and Scarlett Johansson do.","Unlike Hollywood, there is a dearth of female action films in Hindi cinema, says actor Shilpa Shetty who hopes the scenario will change in the coming future.
Shetty, who is set to star as a cop in Rohit Shetty’s maiden OTT series Indian Police Force, said even the audiences are ready to see women actors in action avatars on the screen.
“It is because of the budget that we don’t make female action films here, and also, we are still in a male-dominated society. I would love to have a scenario where women in India can also portray characters like Gal Gadot and Scarlett Johansson do. I would love to do a film like, Long Kiss Goodnight. Geena (Davis) was amazing.

Shetty, 48, essays the role of police officer Tara Shetty in Indian Police Force, dubbed as the next chapter in Rohit Shetty’s cinematic cop universe that started with the 2011 movie Singham and expanded with Singham Returns (2014), Simmba (2018) and Sooryavanshi (2021). The series will also feature Sidharth Malhotra and Vivek Oberoi.
The actor, who made her debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Baazigar (1993) and then featured in films such as Main Khiladi Tu Anari, Dhadkan, Phir Milenge and Life in a… Metro, thanked Rohit Shetty for casting her in an age-appropriate role in Indian Police Force.

“I call her a shero… I would feel odd to do a part that’s not age-appropriate. Age is just a number. It’s also about how you are ageing. If you are going to look your age and not look the part, the maker will not cast.
“But if you are not looking that age and you are looking the part, they will. We are already seeing that women are offered some really meaty roles and they are coming into their own. So, it’s a great time for us.” Indian Police Force is described as an ode to the selfless service, unconditional commitment and fierce patriotism of police officers across the country.

According to the actor, her role was originally intended for a male actor but the filmmaker decided to cast Shetty instead.
“I’m the only female cop in the cop universe that he sets in the series. He has treated the character as a character and not made any changes as per the gender, which is brilliant,” she said.

“It was so well-written, and it was tough on paper, and even tougher as an artist to portray. She is a hard nut to crack. She is in a senior position, assertive, and authoritative. So, it’s an amazing part to sink your teeth into,” she said. To portray the part, Shetty said she subconsciously sought inspiration from former IPS officer Kiran Bedi.

“I’ve played the part exactly the way Rohit wanted it. Maybe you will see an element of her (Bedi). She speaks authoritatively, so this was there at the back of my head,” she said.
During the show’s shooting, the actor had broken her leg. As she was recuperating at home, the actor signed her next project — the pan-India film KD-The Devil. The period action entertainer, directed by filmmaker Prem, features Druva Sarja and Sanjay Dutt among others.
“When he (Prem) came to narrate the script, I was like, ‘I’ll listen to it but I don’t want to do it because I’m not in that frame of mind’. He narrated the script and at interval point, with my broken foot, I got up and said, ‘I’ll do it.’ Shetty also said that she has deliberately chosen to play parts that surprise the audience.

“I have decided to do characters that I’ve not done before and surprise people. Everybody looks at Shilpa Shetty as someone who is glamorous. They forget that I’ve delivered so many different characters before.
“It’s not their fault, as I didn’t do a lot of work in the last ten years. Now, since I’ve decided to do work, I look at it differently. So, from ‘Indian Police Force’ and then KD, it is an absolutely different avatar, my next outing I want it to be totally diverse.” Indian Police Force will also feature Shweta Tiwari and Nikitin Dheer. The seven-part action series will debut on January 19 on streamer Prime Video.

"‘Bobby Deol’s simplicity stems from his upbringing, his mother would straighten him up if he shows attitude’: Vikram Bhatt","Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt recently praised Bobby Deol and highlighted the influential role played by his mother, Prakash Kaur, in shaping the actor's personality.","Bobby Deol’s career has always experienced significant highs and lows. However, the challenges peaked in the last decade, leading Deol to take a three-year hiatus, starting in 2014. Despite attempting a comeback in 2017, co-starring with his brother Sunny in Deol Shreyas Talpade’s Poster Boys, the film proved to be a box-office failure, further impacting Deol’s career. Nonetheless, he found relief in 2018 when Remo D’Souza’s Race 3 became a hit, despite receiving poor reviews.
Since then, he has been on a trial-and-error process, encountering both successes and setbacks in his projects. After a long time, Bobby Deol’s career witnessed a massive hit in 2023 with Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, where he played the antagonist. Earning over Rs 900 crore Animal emerged as the third-highest-grossing Indian film of 2023.

"Lift: Kevin Hart, Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s caper fails to take off",The latest addition of Netflix's catalogue of heist thrillers is riddled with predictable twists and cardboard-like characters,"The premise of Lift, which is the latest movie to be added to Netflix’s catalogue of heist thrillers, sounds fascinating as a massive consignment of gold is to be stolen mid-air. The thriller shot in some of the most beautiful locations of the world, including Venice, Switzerland and Ireland, looks slick. The movie, which presumably wants to be an edge-of-the-seat thriller, is powered by a diverse cast. Yet, the movie helm by F. Gary Gray, who has directed movies like The Italian Job (2003) and The Fate of the Furious (2017), falls short of being gripping as it goes for style over substance.
Written by Daniel Kunka, Lift follows the adventures of a professional thief Cyrus Whitaker (Kevin Hart) and his expert crew as they attempt the ultimate heist: stealing USD 500 million in gold from a vault on a plane — 40000 feet in the air as it flies over the Alps. The thriller has a team of hackers who can make the most complicated heists look like child’s play. That’s established with a lengthy opening sequence when an enigmatic artist is whisked away by the gang and an intense chase on Venice canals ensues. Soon after, Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is hot on Whitaker’s trail, approaches him with the proposal to steal the gold at her senior official’s behest.

Saindhav movie review: Venkatesh film is utterly avoidable,Saindhav movie review: It seems to be the Rana Naidu impact that Venkatesh has chosen a family-centric action thriller as his 75th project.,"Venkatesh Daggubati’s 75th film, in a career spanning 37 years, is a landmark film. Having revived his career with Drushyam films, F2 and most recently maiden OTT venture Rana Naidu, Venkatesh is not ready to slow down. The mostly negative criticism for Rana Naidu appears to have rattled him, as he has been a mascot for family entertainment almost all of his career. Perhaps that is the reason he has chosen a family-centric action thriller as his 75th project. After successfully delivering two HIT series thrillers, this is a huge next step for director Sailesh Kolanu as well, with Rs 80 crore as its massive budget.
Saindhav is set in a fictional city called Chandra Prastha, which is a hotbed for terrorism, smuggling and also supplies mercenaries to the world. Most of the activity is controlled by a cartel, headed by Vishwamitra (Mukhesh Rishi), supported by Vikas Malik (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and Michael (Jishu Sen Gupta).

"Amrish Puri: Dismissed for his ‘harsh face’ early in career, Bollywood’s favourite baddie was called ‘the best world has ever produced’ by Steven Spielberg",We revisit the life of Bollywood's one of the most iconic villains Amrish Puri and how he managed to carve a niche in the industry despite starting at 41.,"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again — and you might end up like Indian film actor Amrish Puri,” read the text along with the Google Doodle on June 22, 2019, to commemorate the 87th birth anniversary of one of Indian cinema’s most memorable villain. Such was the journey of the man who was best at being the worst on-screen.
One can argue that you need a great villain to make a great hero, Amrish Puri assumed that space. And how. The seasoned actor, with his baritone, big eyes, and twitched forehead, struck terror in the hearts of heroes, heroines and fans alike. Whether it was as Mogambo, Durjan Singh or Baba Bhairo Nath, this student of theatre doyens, Ebrahim Alkazi and Satyadev Dubey, made baddies in Bollywood memorable. He created his own brand of villainy. While pages can be filled in appreciation of Puri’s vast canvas as a villain, that’s not all there is to him.

Agastya Nanda on dealing with negativity after The Archies: ‘I had a rosy picture… thought everyone will love me’,"Agastya Nanda made his acting debut with Zoya Akhtar's Hindi adaptation of The Archies. The film received mixed reviews, something the young actor accepts he didn't know how to deal with.","Actor Agastya Nanda made his big acting debut with Netflix’s The Archies and confesses he was taken aback by the mixed reviews. Grandson of superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Agastya shared that it took him some time to understand that the negative reactions can’t stop him and he has to try again.
In an interview with The Film Companion, Agastya confessed that the negative reactions to his debut film left him confused. “Honestly, I didn’t know how to deal with it. When you are not prepped in this area, you don’t know that many people have many opinions. And that’s okay, you must have your opinion but I didn’t know what was going on. Some people hated it, some people liked it, some people were indifferent to it and that’s ok,” said Agastya, son of Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Nikhil Nanda.

His upcoming projects include Disney Plus Hotstar's The Legend Of Hanuman Season 3 and Rohit Shetty's show Indian Police Force.,"One of the most recognizable voices in Bollywood, Sharad Kelkar recently opened up about dubbing for South Indian films and being recognised as Prabhas’ voice in South Indian movies dubbed in Hindi. The actor started lending his voice to Prabhas in Baahubali, and his latest project with the Telugu star was Prashanth Neel’s Salaar.
“I used to stammer since childhood. I used to stammer till I started acting. I never dreamt of becoming an actor, leave alone being a voice actor,” says Sharad when he’s reminded of how his voice has a different fan following after he dubbed for Prabhas’ characters in Baahubali films and Salaar. He also dubbed for Prabhas in the Hindi version of Adipurush.

"Role Play movie review: No film featuring Bill Nighy has the right to be this boring, but Prime Video’s assassin comedy manages it","Role Play movie review: Kaley Cuoco and Bill Nighy are game, but the new Prime Video movie is an overwhelmingly dull assassin comedy with neither laughs nor any discernible intrigue.","Every movie in the world, including those that haven’t yet been made, could benefit greatly from a spot of Bill Nighy. And never before has this theory been proven so unambiguously than in the new Prime Video movie Role Play. An instantly forgettable action-comedy in which Kaley Cuoco plays a secret assassin living a double life as a regular person with a loving husband and two kids, Role Play is a mostly lifeless experience that is practically resuscitated by Nighy in a 15-minute cameo.
He has the unique ability to command your attention even if he isn’t doing anything. If he were to be cast as a lamppost, you could count on him to make it the most evocative lamppost performance of all time. This isn’t hyperbole; while Nighy has thankfully never played an inanimate object in his career, he once voiced a villainous Pokemon. He was just as committed to that role as he was to his Oscar-nominated performance in Living. And as with most projects fortunate enough to have him on board, Nighy is the best thing about Role Play as well.

Ayalaan movie review: Sivakarthikeyan’s sci-fi film feels dated,"The laughs in this sci-fi comedy are sparse and few, much like the good ideas.","“For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love,” reads a popular quote from Carl Sagan’s novel Contact, an inspiration for countless sci-fi films and stories. In essence, it contextualizes humans from the perspective of an extraterrestrial life form. A notable exploration of such an idea in India is Aamir Khan’s PK. While the Bollywood film delved into the belief systems and values of humans, Ayalaan superficially touches on such ‘deep’ subjects. Upon arrival, the alien in this film finds a plastic bag, and its advanced system reveals that plastic takes 300 years to decay. Later, a drunkard mistakes it for a fellow alcoholic and gives him some money. The system now says that it is just paper and will decay relatively fast. The alien discards both items with equal disdain. It also has a similar distaste for all the junk food consumed by humans. Naturally, when he is desperate for some help on Earth, he ‘gravitates’ (since it’s an alien film) towards the hero Tamizh. Now, Tamizh is an organic farmer who would rather live in poverty than use pesticides. He politely pleads with the locust swarm (because even that is a life form too) to leave as it destroys his cornfield in minutes. You get the drift.
The reason the alien—by the way, he is called Tattoo by his human friends for a reason that’s not as funny as it is supposed to be—arrives on Earth is to inspect a catastrophe caused by new technology. It finds out the man behind the menace, Aryan. These days, Tamil filmmakers aren’t too subtle about the nomenclature and the politics behind it. If the hero is named Tamizh, it is fitting that the villain is Aryan (Sharad Kelkar). But no brownie points for the way his character is written. He is the quintessential Jagapathi Babu kind of villain who has gotten hold of an alien rock called Spark, which gives immense power for deep mining. He drills too deep into the Earth, and the prehistoric toxins are released into the atmosphere, which, obviously, is not good news. The rest is as predictable as it can get, except for the bond Tamizh and Tattoo form. It goes beyond being just emotional bromance as they start sharing powers. It is only fair that the villain gets some of it, and so he does. It is all achieved with some contrived writing.

Anthony Hopkins debates weighty topics in Freud’s Last Session,Anthony Hopkins plays the role of psychologist Sigmund Freud in the film Freud's Last Session.,"Oscar-winning British actor Anthony Hopkins steps into the role of psychologist Sigmund Freud in a new film that features a fictional debate with author C.S. Lewis.
Freud’s Last Session, now playing in US theaters, shows the pair discussing hefty topics such as the existence of God and the future of mankind just as World War II is about to begin. Actor Matthew Goode plays Lewis.
Anthony Hopkins said that when he read the script, he looked for places where his character could move around to keep viewers interested.

“If you are going to have a debate on God … you can’t sit around. People just fall asleep. So, you have to keep it moving,” he said in an interview with Reuters.
The 86-year-old actor said he did not do extensive research to play the founder of psychoanalysis, as he would when he was a younger actor.

“Once you start filling your head with unnecessary information, biographical information, of somebody like Freud, then you get tangled up … and it’s distracting,” he said.
“You learn from the text” of the script, Hopkins added. “What I do is I take the text, the lines and the words, and dig under them a little, like digging up pebbles in the street.”

"Ranbir Kapoor-Konkona Sen Sharma reprise their roles from Wake Up Sid for new ad, recreate famous ‘bread and jam cake’ scene","Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma shared screen space after almost 15 years for a new, interesting advertisement.","Bollywood fans got excited when a video featuring Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma went viral a few days ago, sparking discussions about Wake Up Sid 2. However, their hopes were crushed when it was revealed that the video was just an ad, not a teaser for the anticipated sequel. Ranbir and Konkona have reunited after almost 15 years and the latest advertisement brought back some core Wake Up Sid memories.
In the ad, Sid moves to Goa with Ayesha, just like in the original film where he introduced her to Mumbai. As they settle into their new home, Sid feels a bit unsure about them shifting to Goa, but the love of friends, his wife Ayesha, and a thoughtful gift from his father, the Oppo Reno 11 Pro, help him feel at ease. Towards the end of the ad, Konkona made a bread and jam cake for Ranbir, just how Sid made for Aisha in the film. The title ‘Sid wakes up in Goa’ features at the beginning of the ad.

All in the Family, Grey’s Anatomy, Game of Thrones, Martin and many more series will get the special treatment at Monday night’s ceremony at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, with many getting renditions of their sets, including the bar from Cheers.

“It was really about, how can we celebrate 75 years of television differently?” the show’s executive producer Jesse Collins told The Associated Press.
The first such scene will come within the 10 minutes of host Anthony Anderson’s Emmys opening, and the moments will be spread throughout the Fox telecast.
“The core of it,” said Dionne Harmon, another executive producer, “is really celebrating television and to honor the shows of yesterday while we honor the shows of today.”
Collins, Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay from Jesse Collins Entertainment are producing the Emmys for the first time, after previously putting on the Oscars, American Music Awards and BET Awards.
ADVERTISEMENT
With the tribute segments they’re seeking to show decades of television in its full variety of styles, formats and periods.
From the Emmys’ earliest days in the 1950s will come I Love Lucy; from the 1960s, The Carol Burnett Show, whose title star recently won her seventh Emmy at age 90; from the 1970s, All in the Family, whose legendary creator, TV legend Norman Lear, died last month at 101.
  Cheers will represent the ’80s. Ally McBeal and Martin will represent different sides of the ’90s. The television-game-changing Sopranos will show up from the early 2000s.
Shows still on the air — Grey’s Anatomy and American Horror Story — will also be represented.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bits featuring Saturday Night Live and The Arsenio Hall Show will show up for variety and talk.
“We just tried to pick ones that we felt like we could successfully pay tribute to,” Collins said. “We have a pretty vast array of comedies and procedural dramas and talk shows, just trying to touch all the different areas.”
And the shows come from all four networks and HBO, a perennial Emmys juggernaut that this year has all three of the top nominated shows — “Succession,” “The Last of Us” and “The White Lotus,” — and was home to the winningest drama of all time, which is also among the classic shows getting honored.
“We have a great ‘Game of Thrones’ moment,” Collins said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Producers didn’t give specifics on who will be appearing, and said not to expect everyone from every show.
Reunions aren’t possible for all of them, of course. “I Love Lucy,” whose key cast members have all been dead for decades, will get a recreation by actors playing Lucy and Ethel.
Other shows have few left to reunite. All in the Family only has two surviving major cast members, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers. The same is true of The Carol Burnett Show, with only Burnett and Vicki Lawrence still alive.
They also said not to expect a reunion of the cast of Friends, though the show will include some tribute to Matthew Perry, who died in October.
ADVERTISEMENT
Emmy producers said they tried to take a different approach to each of the segments to make sure it doesn’t start to feel like a repetitive trope.
“We want to make sure people remain entertained and engaged so you never really know what you’re going to see, even with the reunions,” Rouzan-Clay told the AP.
While wrangling multiple actors from different eras is never easy, and synching schedules was a tangled thicket as everyone became available again with the end of the writers and actors strikes that pushed the show from September to January, Emmy organizers didn’t have to twist many arms to get people to take part.
“People are happy to be back and happy to celebrate,” Harmon said. “It is a monumental year. Everybody was really excited to come be a part of this.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/emmys-2024-75-years-of-tv-to-be-celebrated-with-reunions-recreations-of-classics-like-lucy-martin-greys-anatomy-and-game-of-thrones-9106797/,entertainment
"Parasite director Bong, South Korean artists urge probe into handling of actor Lee Sun-kyun’s case",South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun was found dead last month in an apparent suicide.,"A group of South Korean filmmakers, actors and industry officials, including Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, on Friday called for a probe into the handling by police and media of drug abuse allegations involving late actor Lee Sun-kyun.
Lee, who shot to global fame with his performance as the wealthy patriarch in the Oscar-winning film Parasite, was found dead last month in an apparent suicide.
Bong and more than a dozen other film, music and entertainment industry figures held a news conference in Seoul, urging authorities to look into whether police handled Lee’s case without violating security and privacy rules.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since his case was first reported by a local newspaper citing a police official, Lee suffered attacks on his reputation due to constant leaks about the investigation even after multiple drug tests came back negative, they said.

They also denounced “sensational” coverage by some news outlets and YouTubers focusing on Lee’s private life using unverified information, calling it “yellow journalism.”
“We call for a fact-finding probe into whether there were any security problems regarding the police investigation,” Bong said, reading a statement signed by more than 2,000 artists and 29 industry associations.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.

“We’re asking the press and media,” singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin said, “Wasn’t your coverage sensational, highlighting someone’s private life just because he was a pop culture artist?”
Calls to Incheon police, which investigated Lee went unanswered. Its chief has denied violating security rules while expressing regret over his death.
Lee’s death rekindled criticism from the entertainment industry and the public over the often harsh and public nature of any criminal investigations involving celebrities which fuelled media coverage and pressure on them.
Yoon singled out a report by public broadcaster KBS using a recording of Lee’s phone call with a bar hostess, questioning if it was meant to serve people’s right to know and demanding it be deleted.
ADVERTISEMENT
KBS said in a statement it stood by its reporting that was aired more than a month before Lee’s death and the content was used with “maximum restraint” to uncover the facts of the case.
“The recording was used in a very limited way because it was not irrelevant to the allegations (against Lee) but was in fact supporting the credibility of the claim,” it said.
Lee made three highly public appearances before police between October and December, the last time for 19 hours overnight.
He had denied knowingly taking illegal drugs and said he was tricked by the bar hostess who later blackmailed him, local news media reported before his death.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lee was the latest in a long line of South Korean artists and celebrities to took their lives, already under intense pressure from competition and prying interest in their personal lives, often aggravated by online bullying and personal attacks.

Captain Miller movie review: Dhanush’s film is a brilliant political drama in the guise of an actioner,Dhanush's Captain Miller review: There's not even a single moment in the entire 160 minutes of runtime where Arun Matheshwaran's script meanders.,"It has become hard to write about Tamil cinema without mentioning Quentin Tarantino. His influence is now omnipresent. While most try only to emulate his ‘cool’ aesthetics, where even violence becomes fun, Arun Matheswaran digs deeper. It is not just the style; Arun Matheswaran recreates the catharsis that one gets from watching Django Unchained.
It wouldn’t be a stretch to call Captain Miller an Indian Django Unchained. The parallels are obvious. If Django Unchained is the journey of an empowered slave with a bounty hunter, Captain Miller is the story of a caste-oppressed villager. Instead of Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), we have Kannaiya (Elango Kumaravel). For one Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), we have many stand-ins like Kumastha Kanagasabai (Kali Venkat) and sepoy James (Ashwin Kumar). Of course, the politics of black slavery and Indian casteism are two different oppression machines, and that’s where Arun Mateswaran’s brilliance lies. He brings in so many layers to this political drama, which masquerades as an action-driven star vehicle.

Boman Irani says Shah Rukh Khan doesn’t make his actors a ‘commodity’: ‘He likes seeing the joy on people’s faces…’,Boman Irani was all praise for Shah Rukh Khan and revealed how he eases the tension on sets by cracking a joke on himself.,"Veteran actor Boman Irani, who was recently seen in Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dunki, has opened up about his experience working with SRK in several films. Boman explained how Shah Rukh eases the tension on sets by cracking a joke on himself and added that people always look forward to his arrival. 
In an interview with Connect FM Canada, Boman said, “I think Shah Rukh Khan understands where he came from. I think I’m judging. I may be wrong, but he understands what it is for a person to be doing one of their first films in the film industry and how one is treated. Not as a commodity, not as a person who’s supplying something; that person is supplying his talent, his art, his being. I think he understands that.”

"Animal actor Saurabh Sachdeva disagrees with film’s definition of ‘alpha male’, says ‘story didn’t progress’ before the interval","Animal actor Saurabh Sachdeva offered his two cents on the criticism that Sandeep Reddy Vanga's film has been receiving, as he appreciated the filmmaker's unique approach to writing.","Actor Saurabh Sachdeva, who appeared in a supporting role in the blockbuster film Animal, spoke about director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s clutter-breaking approach to filmmaking and the divisive reactions that the film has drawn. Starring Ranbir Kapoor, Animal has grossed over Rs 900 crore worldwide, and has emerged as the third-biggest Indian film of 2023. But it also attracted criticism for scenes perceived to be belittling towards women.
In an interview, Saurabh said that he doesn’t quite agree with the defence that Ranbir is playing an ‘alpha male’, and admitted that he hasn’t made up his mind about where he stands on the film’s morality. Saurabh, who also operates an acting school, said that he has had several discussions about the film with his students, and finds himself agreeing with both sides of the argument. He did, however, say that any movie that is able to elicit strong reactions from the audience is more admirable than something that doesn’t register at all.

"Guntur Kaaram movie review: Mahesh Babu tries hard, but Trivikram prevents us from screaming ‘Jai Babu’","Guntur Kaaram movie review: Mahesh Babu, in top-notch form, is the sole redeeming factor in Trivikram's unnecessarily prolonged film, preventing it from becoming a tedious watch.","Trivikram Srinivas’ Guntur Kaaram serves as definitive proof that in-form Mahesh Babu can keep us hooked to a 159-minute movie without feeling fatigued. Ok, that sounds misleading; let’s rephrase… Mahesh Babu, in top-notch form, is the sole redeeming factor in Trivikram’s unnecessarily stretched Guntur Kaaram, preventing it from becoming a tedious watch. Yep, that sounds more accurate.
The biggest and most anticipated film of this Sankranti/Pongal season, Guntur Kaaram is basically a celebration of Tollywood’s superstar and everything associated with his stardom. Trivikram keeps Mahesh Babu front and centre, never giving the audience a chance to miss him.

"Shah Rukh Khan makes sure Chandrayaan-3 scientist gets moment in the spotlight, wins hearts: ‘Mohan Bhargav hai woh…’. Watch","Shah Rukh Khan found new ways to win hearts at a recent event, where he spotlighted an ISRO scientist who was trying to stay under the radar.","Actor Shah Rukh Khan broke his silence on the many successes and setbacks that he has experienced in the last few years, as he accepted an honour at a recent awards ceremony. In his speech, Shah Rukh alluded to the arrest of his son, Aryan Khan, and spoke about the trio of hit film that he starred in last year. He also charmed the crowd with his trademark wit and fun interactions with others, such as director Mani Ratnam. But a kind gesture that he made towards P Veeramuthuvel, the project director in charge of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, caught the attention of his fans on social media, and a video of the moment is being widely shared online.
The short clip from the end of the awards ceremony shows Shah Rukh pulling Veeramuthuvel towards him, making sure that the ISRO scientist gets his moment in the spotlight. The shy Veeramuthuvel was trying to remain in the background, but Shah Rukh wouldn’t have it. Previously, the actor had obliged the ISRO team by joining them on stage for a photograph. Veeramuthuvel was joined on stage by ISRO chairman S Somanath, and they were felicitated by union minister Dr Jitendra Singh, who described the chairman as ‘the Shah Rukh Khan of space’, much to the actor’s amusement.

HanuMan movie review: Teja Sajja film is the perfect family entertainer on Makar Sankranthi,"HanuMan movie review: Tejja Sajja and Prashanth Varma film takes a leaf from Indian mythology and effortlessly adds it to the superhero genre, delivering an engaging and entertaining film.","The Sankranthi movie releases this year touched a new high with four Telugu films coming out simultaneously. While Ravi Teja’s Eagle bowed out from the race at the last minute, Teja Sajja’s HanuMan has multiple biggies to compete with as it releases today. Despite the big names in the fray, HanuMan — with relative newcomers such as Prashanth Varma and Teja Sajja in the driving seat — stuck to its guns, and upped the stakes with paid premiers and a bold marketing strategy. The current mood of the nation with the Ayodhya Temple ceremony also played an important part.
HanuMan takes the major elements from the Ramayana and squeezes it into an egg-sized gem, calling it Rudhira Mani (blood gem) and places it in Anjanadri village. In the first half, we see Hanuman as a silent witness to all the happenings in that village. We meet the film’s bad guy, Gajapathi (Raj Deepak Shetty), a big man in the small village, and its hero, Hanumanthu (Teja Sajja), a petty thief.

"‘If Mukesh Ambani was an actor, no one will cast him as a rich industrialist’: Pankaj Tripathi feels ‘cinema has created stereotypes’","Pankaj Tripathi mentioned in a recent interview that in cinema, people tend to box actors into particular roles based on their looks.","Actor Pankaj Tripathi has been playing all his roles with utmost perfection, be it that of a criminal in Mirzapur and Gangs of Wasseypur or that of an emotional father in Bareilly Ki Barfi and Gunjan Saxena. All his roles, to this day, have been based in the heartland of the country and the audience has barely seen him as a royal or a rich character. But this is not by choice. Tripathi believes he is equally capable of acing a “posh” role if given an opportunity. However, he mentioned in a recent interview that in cinema, people tend to stereotype and box actors into particular roles based on their looks.
While interacting with ANI, Tripathi insisted on ‘changing the perspective of cinema’. He said, “In cinema, we have made a stereotype that a doctor looks like this, an engineer looks like that. During auditions, a brief is written even for the junior artists like ‘rich look, corporate look’. Humne baant rakha hai duniya ko, ki ye look hota hai, vo look hota hai (We have divided the world based on looks). We imagine Katrina Kaif in the role of a doctor. But you go to Delhi’s AIIMS, how many Katrinas will you find there?”

Directed by Trivikram Srinivas, Guntur Kaaram is an old-school ‘masala’ potboiler that also features Sreeleela. The movie is set to pick up where the Prabhas-starrer Salaar left off, marking an auspicious start to the new year for the Telugu box office. Three other films – HanuMan, Saindhav and Naa Saami Ranga – are also vying for attention this weekend.
According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Guntur Kaaram has sold advance tickets worth nearly Rs 25 crore for day one, just in India. HanuMan, on the other hand, has sold advance tickets worth Rs 3 crore so far. Late last year, Salaar defied expectations to deliver an opening day domestic haul of Rs 90 crore, and has since made Rs 400 crore in India and more than Rs 700 crore globally.

He said that Vicky is ‘too nice’ to turn down unreasonable work-related requests and can survive on very little sleep, but Hrithik would never compromise on recovery because he’s built differently. In an interview, Gethin spoke about his longtime association with Hrithik, and said that he only works with the people whom he can vibe with on a human level.
Asked if he has noticed any striking differences between the actors that he works with, Gethin told India Today, “Let’s talk about Vicky and Hrithik. With Vicky, he doesn’t sleep much, because his hours are just so, so long. I had this issue with John Abraham as well, where these people are too nice. Vicky is one of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and I don’t think he likes to say no to too many people, so if the directors want him shooting till silly o’clock, he does that. Sometimes, he’ll be running on four hours sleep. But you would never know. He doesn’t come across tired, he doesn’t moan, he doesn’t whinge, and on the set he’s so energetic. But that wouldn’t happen with Hrithik.”

"In times of hyper masculine angst, Mammootty’s Kaathal The Core is the tender heartache cinema needs",Mammootty-Jyothika headlined Kaathal is a glorious palate cleanser in the context of the cinema the country is watching.,"No one in filmmaker Joe Baby’s Kaathal- The Core gets angry. They are lonely, ashamed, trapped and even annoyed. But never angry, an emotion that has otherwise dominated blockbusters of last year. In Mammootty’s latest Malayalam drama, people look out for people, and family comes together, even as the patriarch struggles to come out.
The enormously moving film–currently streaming on Prime Video–is a gentle call for sensitivity as it tries to understand the complexities of coming out. It is optimistic that relationships can be redeemed, even as it follows a marriage falling apart; it remains hopeful that one can continue to love, even if they nurse a broken heart. Featuring possibly one of the most effective performances of last year, Mammootty crafts Mathew Devassy as a man who must rescue himself from the trap that his loved ones and community set him up in. How do you break free, without breaking apart?

Lift movie review: Kevin Hart is completely miscast in Netflix’s slick but silly heist movie,"Lift movie review: Glossy to a fault, director F Gary Gray's Netflix heist movie features a miscast Kevin Hart opposite wall-to-wall special effects.","What’s worse, chaining your movie to a plot so dated that it involves NFTs, or having a character explain what an NFT is? Ultimately, the new Netflix movie Lift does both. Starring Kevin Hart and a host of others whom you’d recognise as ‘that guy from that thing’, Lift plays like a particularly cynical concoction of a late-period Fast & Furious film and a mid-2000s heist movie set in Europe.
It’s no wonder, then, that it is helmed by F Gary Gray, a Hollywood journeyman who has directed one of each in the past. But while The Italian Job was a mostly enjoyable romp, his The Fate of the Furious was an overblown mess marred by infighting among the film’s two lead stars. Gray also couldn’t catch a break with his last film, the failed franchise-starter Men in Black: International. Making the movie was reportedly such a traumatic experience for him, he attempted to bail on the project on several occasions. It’s anybody’s guess if he had a better time on Lift, because audiences probably won’t.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/lift-movie-review-kevin-hart-miscast-in-netflix-heist-movie-9104787/,entertainment

“I just say what I feel like. I’m glad people connect to it. Janta (public) has made me popular with memes and reels. I’m the hero of the audience, they made me a popular actor.

Tripathi, who hails from Belsand village in Gopalganj district of Bihar, narrated an incident from his birthplace to reiterate his social media popularity and how it sometimes has nothing to do with his movies.
“Recently, I came across two boys in my village. They came to me and said they wanted a picture with me. I was like, ‘Which film or show of mine have you seen?’ They said, ‘We haven’t seen any of them but we have seen your memes’. They were like, ‘We are just happy to see you’,” he recalled.
The actor, who will next be seen in a biopic on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, understands commercial cinema’s ability to reach a wide audience. His own taste in cinema may veer towards the middle-of-the-road and independent projects but he always tries to strike a balance when it comes to his roles, he said.

Tripathi said he is an admirer of films such as Court, Killa, Trance and Mandela but commercial cinema, with its power to reach more people, can also impart a message.
“My sense of cinema is that it should be sensible yet commercial, and have a wide reach. We make films with the intention to reach out to more people. Like, ‘Oh My God 2’ is sensible cinema. It was such a solid subject about sex education and it did well at the box office and on OTT,” Tripathi said.
“We often learn a lot of things when said in a light-hearted manner. While, the moment we become serious, we might lose interest. But as an audience my interest is in independent cinema,” he added.
Tripathi said his upcoming release, Main Atal Hoon, on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is made in a sensible and engaging manner.

The biographical drama is directed by filmmaker Ravi Jadhav of Natarang and Balgandharva fame.
“This is the story of Atal ji’s life and also of India’s journey from the time of independence, how elections would happen, how voting would happen, how society changed. The purpose of the biopic is to provide entertainment and at the same time it serves as an inspiration,” the actor said.
The actor further said when he first arrived on the Main Atal Hoon set, he didn’t feel “confident”.
“I’m never confident on the first day of shoot irrespective of the role, whether it is fictional or non-fictional. I’m always like, ‘What will I do? How will I do it? For two-three days, I’ve been struggling to find the sur of the character.

On the first day of the shoot of ‘Main Atal Hoon’, I was doing all the loud gestures and postures. I was sure I didn’t want to imitate Atal ji or get close to him in terms of his look with the help of prosthetics, I had to capture his soul.” In response to a question about how the team ensured the movie would not end up as propaganda, Tripathi said they had made every effort to be authentic.
“We were aware and conscious about it but our whole purpose was to bring out the persona of Atal ji on the big screen. Since the film is a biopic, we had to make sure that we got things factually correct,” he said.
“I feel one should present the person on screen in the most honest possible way. We are humans, we have both goodness and shortcomings and that’s how it should be presented on screen,” he added.

Produced by Vinod Bhanushali, Sandeep Singh, and Kamlesh Bhanushali, Main Atal Hoon will hit theatres on January 19. Bhavesh Bhanushali and Sam Khan serve as co-producers on the movie.

In the caption, Twinkle humorously reflected on their contrasting statures, likening their relationship to Tom and Jerry or Laurel and Hardy. She wrote, “My sister and I are a year apart. I was always the giant, and she was petite. At times, we resembled Tom and Jerry, and sometimes, depending on my weight, Laurel and Hardy. Of course, we teased each other mercilessly. As her husband likes to recount, when he first came to meet my sister, I informed him, ‘You need to know we have different fathers. My father is Vinod Khanna, and hers is Rajesh Khanna, that’s why I am tall and she is not.’ My sister was livid, though I thought it was quite funny. But whenever I am in trouble, she is the first one by my side. She calls me every day, even if it’s to chat about mundane events. I can’t say that if life is a desert, she is my only oasis, but I know that under the scorching sun, she will definitely share that wide-brimmed hat with me, even if it’s just to throw some shade my way:) Here’s to sisters and what would we do without them. What is the funniest thing your sister has done to you? Let me know in the comments below.”

Taapsee Pannu reveals she didn’t believe she was starring in Dunki even after signing the film: ‘People asked me tu film mei hai ya nikal diya’,Taapsee Pannu spoke about how she wants to break the perception that she doesn't do hero-centric films. She also revealed that she didn't believe she was starring in Dunki even after she had signed the film.,"Taapsee Pannu is currently savouring the success of her latest film Dunki, which saw her starring alongside Shah Rukh Khan. In a recent interview, the actor spoke about how she wants to break the perception that she doesn’t do hero-centric films and only stars in projects that have her as the main character. Taapsee also revealed that she couldn’t believe she is starring in Dunki even after she signed the film.
Speaking about the perception about her in the Hindi film industry, Taapsee told Bollywood Hungama, “There is this big misconception that I am tired of clearing. It is often said that I don’t do films if my character isn’t at the centre stage in a film. From Javed Akhtar to everybody had told me, ‘You don’t do films in which you aren’t the main lead, you won’t do a film if it revolves around a hero.’ I was like who is spreading this!”
She added, “I think this can also be the reason that many big films don’t even come to me because it is assumed that I won’t do them. It is also because sometimes anyone can do those characters. There isn’t a specific requirement from the actor. For those kind of films there are so many options that filmmakers don’t even reach me, and I also not part of that group where my name would instantly be taken. Everybody has their comfort zone and people will approach those who are in the zone.”

Talking about how she was in disbelief even after signing Dunki, Taapsee said, “Everybody isn’t like Rajkumar Hirani sir. He doesn’t necessarily need that comfort zone. He texted me out of the blue after watching Manmarziyaan. After watching a lot of my films, purely on merit, he reached out to me for Dunki. It was too good to be true and which is why I didn’t believe it till the first schedule of the film got over. People would ask me at home, ‘Tu picture mein hai na? Nikal toh nahi dia tujh? (You are in the film right? They didn’t kick you out?). In fact, one-and-a-half years before the film went on floors, people were telling me that Raju sir might be looking at some other actors, nothing came from Raju sir though, he was sure about me. So, it was difficult for me to settle down and accept that I am doing this film.”

A critical mistake by the otherwise impeccable officer results in the loss of his wife and daughter, plunging him into depression and chronic insomnia. While battling his inner demons, Ozler encounters a case where a young man is brutally murdered by someone who leaves behind not many clues except for a greeting card with a few words inscribed in Malayalam.

After a few dull seasons, the show seems to have gotten its mojo back. This time around even Kamal Haasan was part of controversies for allegedly siding with certain contestants.
As the season comes to a close on Sunday with a grand finale, here’s a look at some of the controversial moments of the season:",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/as-bigg-boss-tamil-season-7-comes-to-a-close-a-look-at-top-controversial-moments-of-this-edition-9104663/,entertainment
Greta Gerwig reacts to host Jo Coy’s sexist remarks about Barbie at Golden Globes: ‘He’s not wrong..’,Greta Gerwig agreed with host Jo Coy's joke that Barbie was based 'on a plastic doll with big boobies.',"People watching the Golden Globes weren’t happy with first-time host Jo Koy’s monologue on Sunday. He made a sexist joke about the year’s top movie – Barbie, and since Greta Gerwig’s film fights against gender stereotypes, many viewers thought Koy’s joke was tasteless and unnecessary. The joke in question was: “Oppenheimer is based on the 721-page Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the Manhattan Project — and ‘Barbie’ is about a plastic doll with big boobies.”
Greta has reacted to the statement and instead of roasting or giving a fitting reply, the director kept things simple. She said on BBC Radio 4, “Well, he’s not wrong. She’s the first doll that was mass-produced with breasts, so he was right on. And you know, I think that so much of the project of the movie was unlikely because it is about a plastic doll.”

"Killer Soup review: Manoj Bajpayee, Konkona Sensharma serve a bland broth","Killer Soup review: The whole idea of a black ‘comedy’ is that it is meant to be funny, and that it makes you chortle, despite yourself, but here I kept waiting for the laughs. I also kept waiting for shockers.","A pitch-black comedy, garnished by ‘paya’ soup over a dream serving of Manoj Bajpayee and Konkona Sensharma, and dressed with murder and mayhem? Sign me up already, I’d thought gleefully when I heard of 2024’s new web series, ‘Killer Soup’, directed by Abhishek Chaubey. And it crushes me to say this, but this concoction, which promised so much flavour and freshness, only bubbled up for me intermittently.
First, the plus points. The picturesque setting, in a small town close to Madurai called Mainjur, is perfect for a twisty tale dotted with dodgy characters and dodgier doings. Husband-and-wife duo Swathi (Konkona Sensharma) and Prabhakar aka Prabhu Shetty (Manoj Bajpayee) are in the middle of what seems like a permanent argument, her dreaming of a restaurant of her own, him trying to figure out how to get out of a multi-crore ‘ghapla’. Prabhu’s older brother, the street-smart, foul-mouthed Arvind Shetty (Saiyaji Shinde) is of no help, holding the family purse-strings close, and his art-loving daughter Apeksha aka Apu (Anula Navelkar) even closer, refusing to let her follow her heart. Arvind’s long-time factotum, the gravelly-voiced Lucas (Lal), knows where the skeletons are buried, and is a keeper of past secrets.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/killer-soup-review-manoj-bajpayee-konkona-sensharma-serve-a-bland-broth-9104795/,entertainment
"Rohit Shetty defends Cop Universe against criticism of glorifying police brutality, encounter killings: ‘It’s important to instill fear in the society’",Rohit Shetty said that he is willing to get trolled for saying that fear should be instilled in society in order to protect innocent people from criminals.,"Director Rohit Shetty has addressed allegations that his Singham films glorify police brutality and encounter killings, and said that he knows what the police force goes through, and has observed officers at close quarters. He said that he agrees with the idea of instilling ‘fear’ in the populace, and that he is willing to get ‘trolled’ for his beliefs. The filmmaker is best known for his shared universe of cop movies, which includes two Singham films, Simmba, Sooryavanshi, and the upcoming Indian Police Force series and a third installment in the Singham series.
In an interview with Film Companion, Rohit was asked about these complaints, and he said, “I’m clear in my head about what I’m saying. All of us here are cultured people, but that life is a totally different life. Imagine if you’re going to office and you’re meeting a druggie, a rapist, someone who has chopped the head of an innocent person. When you deal with those kinds of people, you have a different frame of mind altogether.”

"Did Shah Rukh Khan take a dig at Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal? ‘If I play a bad guy, I make sure he dies a dog’s death’","Shah Rukh Khan said that if he plays a bad guy in a film, he would make sure that the character is not rewarded.","Shah Rukh Khan has been a Hindi film hero for over 30 years, and while the actor is known for playing quintessential romantic leads, he has played a few villainous roles as well. But, SRK has largely stayed away from glorifying negative roles in the latter part of his career. At a recent event, where Shah Rukh Khan was honoured as ‘The Indian of the Year’, the actor said that if he were to play a negative character, he would make sure that the character “dies a dog’s death.” It appeared that the actor was taking a dig at director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s controversial blockbuster Animal, which has been criticised for glorifying the morally reprehensible behaviour of its protagonist.
At a News18 event, Shah Rukh said, “I am a guy who is hopeful and tells happy stories. The heroes I play do good things, they give hope and happiness. If I play a bad guy, I make sure he suffers a lot, he dies a dog’s death, because I believe goodness begets goodness. And I believe badness deserves a kick in the back side.” He continued, “I should play honest roles that give people courage to dream. I should keep working hard quietly with the hope that life doesn’t topple my apple cart anytime soon.”

Days before the premiere of her debut film Love Sonia in 2018, the actor bumped into a journalist colleague after a packed afternoon of media interviews.

Criminal Record review: New Apple show is the British antithesis to Delhi Crime; it’s addictive but not unmissable,"Criminal Record review: Apple's new series works better as a psychological thriller than a routine police procedural, although stars Peter Capaldi and Cush Jumbo are in top form.","A tendency to misdirect dilutes Apple’s new crime-thriller series, Criminal Report. Written by Paul Rutman, the eight-episode show pits two London detectives — one a veteran of the police force and the other a wet-behind-the-ears rookie — against each other, when a seemingly dead and buried old murder case beckons from beyond the grave. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game that functions better as a psychological thriller than as a socially responsible police procedural.
Played by Cush Jumbo, Detective Sergeant June Lenker comes across a distress call from a young woman, who tells the operator in hushed tones that her life is in danger. Her boyfriend, she claims, is also responsible for a murder of another young woman that took place over a decade ago. A Black man by the name of Errol Mathis was convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison for that crime, but the woman believes that Mathis is innocent. DS Lenker discovers that the investigating officer in the case was the infamous Detective Inspector Daniel Hegarty, a no-nonsense Glaswegian played in the show by the searingly intense Peter Capaldi.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/criminal-record-review-apple-peter-capaldi-cush-jumbo-crime-thriller-9103304/,entertainment

The arrangement with Warner Bros is non-exclusive, with Cruise working on the next installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise for Paramount Pictures, according to one source.
Warner Bros and the other major studios are working to rebound from a protracted work stoppage, as Hollywood writers and later, its actors, walked off the job in 2023.
Writers and actors from Hollywood went on strike demanding higher wages and protection against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in filmmaking.
The dual strikes shut down a large portion of film and television production, halted late-night talk shows and forced broadcast networks to fill TV slots with repeats of reality shows.

The strikes led to a delay in Tom Cruise’s next Mission Impossible film as production house Paramount Global also bore the brunt of one of the longest work stoppages in the U.S. entertainment industry history.

"Javed Akhtar says Hindi film industry was ‘convinced of its superiority’, Mani Ratnam made them feel like ‘illiterate children’: ‘He slapped us hard’","Javed Akhtar said that while the Hindi film industry was feeling superior, Mani Ratnam made them feel like 'illiterate children'.","Javed Akhtar, who recently attended an event to honour director Mani Ratnam for his achievement in cinema, said that for decades, the Hindi film industry was “convinced of our superiority” but all of that changed when Mani Ratnam started making movies and made them feel like “illiterate children”.
Speaking at an event for News 18, Javed said, “Bombay film industry people have been very complacent and sure of ourselves. We used to be completely convinced of our superiority. And then, a director came from Tamil Nadu, he slapped us hard on our face with the kind of work we had never seen.” The veteran writer called the director’s work “unprecedented” and said, “We were very sure of our technical superiority. He made us feel like illiterate children.”
Javed Akhtar said that in the film industry, success comes to many but only those who have done some “exceptional work” can sustain that success. “It wont be politically right but I can give you names of ten directors who have made number of superhits but nobody remembers them. In the film industry, it is not only success that sustains you, success with some exceptional work, and that is by Mani Ratnam,” he said.

He said, “Javed saab, I think we need you back writing screenplay. It will help us a lot. Especially in these times, when we are talking of just numbers, I think we need Javed saab.”
When asked when he would be willing to make his next film, Mani Ratnam joked that he will do so when Javed Akhtar writes a screenplay for him. Mani is now looking forward to his next film with Kamal Haasan.

Their best tracks included “Thenum Vayambum”, “Ezhu Swarangalum”, “Sukhamo Devi”, “Azhake Ninmizhi”, “Olikkunnuvo”, “Etho Nidrathan” and “Ramakadha”.

While singing the song at the Raveendra Sangeetha Sandhya event, organised by the Mazhavil Manorama television channel as a tribute to Raveendran, Yesudas was joined on stage by its lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri.
Towards the end of the song, Yesudas, visibly moved, expressed that he sensed Raveendran’s presence with them on stage. He remarked with a lump in his throat, “This song marked my comeback. Raveendran demonstrated that songs relying solely on the singers’ voices, without theatrics, can captivate audiences.”

Yesudas began his music career with the Malayalam song “Jathi Bhedam Matha Dwesham” in 1961 and sang mainly in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films, apart from songs in other languages as well. Some of his well-known Hindi songs, which went on to become hits, include “Jab Deep Jale Aana” and “Gori Tera”.
He was honoured with the Padma Vibhushan in 2017 and is a recipient of eight national awards, 25 Kerala state awards, five state awards of Tamil Nadu, and four of Andhra Pradesh.

Watch,Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's holiday home in Alibaug is an extension of their personalities. Step inside their white-themed home where family is always the priority.,"For Virat Kohli, cricketer and former captain of the Indian team, prioritising feelings of relaxation, centredness and peace is crucial and his holiday home in Alibaug perfectly embodies these sentiments. “A holiday home should be one that gives you the feeling of home away from away,” the cricketer said as he gave a tour of his and Anushka Sharma’s newly constructed holiday home in Alibaug, a coastal town south of Mumbai.
A notable feature of the house is its deliberate lack of a television or other entertainment sources in the living room, making it exclusively reserved for conversations. “I really value and cherish having meals together as a family. To be very honest, I did not do enough of that as a kid myself,” he told Architectural Digest India, as he showed it the dining room at his home.

The actor said that initially, the poverty didn’t bother him, because he was so immersed in his work, but over time, he began to realise the importance of financial security. In a chat with his Killer Soup co-star Konkona Sensharma for Indian Express, Manoj looked back on his time at Delhi University, and then experiencing the customary struggle after he moved to Mumbai.
He said that he values theatre more than cinema, because in cinema, he feels he is too dependent on other departments. “It really prepares you, physically, mentally, emotionally. It really aligns you, and that happens to every actor. But the days were of complete poverty. But those days were when you could not get the time to think about poverty. If you don’t have money to eat, you’re not thinking about eating, because you’re so involved and engrossed in what you’re doing, you’re forgetting that you didn’t have food.” Ironically, Manoj hasn’t had dinner in 14 years for health reasons.

He recalled a story about being approached by Sunny Deol, who was impressed with a documentary he’d directed in the early ’90s. He also opened up about casting Varun Dhawan in Badlapur, even though he’d initially designed the character for an older actor.

His new film, Merry Christmas, features the unlikely pair of Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi. He said, “If I keep an actor in mind on the blank page, it’s damn tough. You end up writing cliched stuff that’s already been done. Many years back, I’d not even made a single film, Sunny Deol happened to see (the Raman Raghav documentary), he called me and said, ‘Let’s do something’.”

Sriram first shot the film in Hindi, and then, mainly to mitigate escalating costs, shot a modified version in Tamil. He addressed the dryness that had set into the crew when they started work on the Tamil film, and said that the process was particularly ‘torturous’ for Katrina Kaif, who even suggested that he cast a different actor in her place.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, Sriram said that they’d erected a set for the film, which went unused for several months because of scheduling conflicts. This escalated the film’s budget, which was a source of stress for the filmmaker, who’d envisioned it as a relatively small-scale project. “The rewriting continued till the last day. When Vijay Sethupathi came in, it was still a Hindi film. But during the second wave, we’d built a set, but for three months we couldn’t shoot because Katrina’s dates were clashing with Tiger and Vijay was also not free… So, 70% of the set was done, but we were prohibited from shooting, so we had to bring (the set) down. Costs were going up, but nothing was on screen,” he said.

"Vicky Jain’s mother says Ankita Lokhande ‘beating’ her ‘devta’ son is unfair, accuses her of gaining ‘sympathy’ by talking about Sushant Singh Rajput",Vicky Jain's mother said she never wanted her son to marry Ankita Lokhande. She also said that Ankita has been trying to win the sympathy of the audience by repeatedly talking about Sushant Singh Rajput.,"Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain’s relationship has been going through a rough patch ever since they entered the television’s most controversial reality show, Bigg Boss 17. Recently, their mothers entered the show during the ongoing ‘Family Week’ and shared their opinion with their children. However, after coming out of the house, Vicky’s mother said she never wanted her son to marry Ankita. She also said that the Pavitra Rishta actor has been trying to win the sympathy of the audience by repeatedly talking about her former boyfriend and late actor, Sushant Singh Rajput.
“Ankita has been naming Sushant. Looks like she is trying to gain sympathy for herself. Sushant is anyway gone,” Vicky Jain’s mother told Saas Bahu Saazish after coming out of the Bigg Boss house. She also spoke about Ankita hitting Vicky, after discussing it with the actor inside the house. She said that since husbands are considered god in India, Ankita should not have hit her husband. “It is unfair. We live in India. Your husband is a devta, you are beating him.”

"Saif Ali Khan wasn’t happy about being dumped from Merry Christmas, but Sriram Raghavan was sure he’d ‘made a mistake’ by casting him","Director Sriram Raghavan opened up about offering Merry Christmas to Saif Ali Khan, and then having a change of heart. He went on to cast Vijay Sethupathi as the male lead instead.","Director Sriram Raghavan opened up about telling Saif Ali Khan that he’d changed his mind about casting him in Merry Christmas, after having shook on it previously. In an interview, the filmmaker said that Saif was understandably annoyed, but the best that he could do in that moment was to assure Saif that he’d try his best to make it up to him. Sriram eventually cast Vijay Sethupathi as the film’s male lead, opposite Katrina Kaif.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, the director was asked about his writing process, and how the character evolved over time. “This story is from a different era. If I’d just taken the bare-bones plot, I could’ve made an episode of CID… I love Saif as an actor, although our last film didn’t work. That time he wasn’t doing so much, so I thought he’d be fun. I went to meet him, he loved the story, said, ‘Great, let’s do it’. And then, I started fleshing it out.”

3 Body Problem trailer: Game of Thrones creators return with new mind-bending thriller. Watch,3 Body Problem is billed as show that would redefine sci-fi drama with its layered mysteries and genre-bending high stakes.,"“Something or someone is targeting our scientists,” a voice over cautions as dead bodies are discovered. “There is someone behind everything, you just have to dig.” Netflix on Wednesday dropped the trailer of its highly anticipated new series 3 Body Problem, which has Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss attached as showrunners and executive producers.
Billed as a thrilling story that “redefines sci-fi drama with its layered mysteries and genre-bending high stakes”, the eight-episode show is based on the acclaimed international bestselling book trilogy, The Three-Body Problem by Chinese author Cixin Liu. Alexander Woo (of The Terror: Infamy, True Blood fame) has co-created the series with Benioff and Weiss and is also the executive producer and writer.

The official synopsis of 3 Body Problem reads, “A young woman’s fateful decision in 1960s China reverberates across space and time into the present day. When the laws of nature inexplicably unravel before their eyes, a close-knit group of brilliant scientists join forces with an unorthodox detective to confront the greatest threat in humanity’s history.”
The over two-minute-long trailer, then, sets up the mind-bending world of the series, amping up it stakes and making it clear that it is going to be a visually stunning journey into several timelines and continents. A handy guidebook of the characters, arcs and timelines perhaps would be recommended, as the show is dense with its plot and mind-boggling with the how it intercut across time and geography.

3 Body Problem stars Jovan Adepo, John Bradley, Liam Cunningham, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, Jess Hong, Marlo Kelly, Alex Sharp, Sea Shimooka, Zine Tseng, Saamer Usmani, Benedict Wong and Jonathan Pryce among others.

OMG 2 director Amit Rai says CBFC ‘killed’ the film’s audience by giving it ‘A’ certificate: ‘Would have been neck and neck with Gadar 2’,"Amit Rai, who directed OMG 2, feels his film could not grow financially because of the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC).","When it was announced that Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2 and Pankaj Tripathi’s OMG 2 would be released on the same day, it was seen as one of the biggest box-office clashes of last year. However, when the two films were finally released in the theatres, Gadar 2 became a sensation at ticket counters, and OMG 2 — riding on critical acclaim — managed to stay steady at the box office but could not match up to the numbers of nationalist drama. Amit Rai, who directed OMG 2, feels his film could not grow financially because of the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC).
OMG 2, also starring Akshay Kumar, received an ‘A’ rating from CBFC, which Rai believes kept his target audience, the families, away from the cinema halls, leading to the film’s less-than-expected performance at the box office. He told DNA in a recent interview, “If it wasn’t an A-certificate film, then maybe it would have been neck and neck with Gadar 2, minting money at the box office because families would have come for it.” While Gadar 2 earned Rs 686 crore worldwide, OMG 2 could earn Rs 221.75 crore.

Though now he wants the ‘bygones be bygones’, Rai also felt the censor board “killed” half of his family audience by giving it an A-rating. He added, “The censor board hurt me financially too and in terms of content as well.” CBFC reportedly suggested 27 changes in the film which deals with sex education, among other issues.

Earlier, Rai had shared that he sent many messages to CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi requesting a U/A certificate for OMG 2. But his request fell on deaf ears. “I remember clearly that I folded my hands. I told them that you are doing the wrong thing because if this film goes on OTT…” he told Bollywood Hungama. The filmmaker even tried to get the film’s certification changed after its release but Joshi “never responded” to his messages.
OMG 2 follows the journey of a father and son who are battling social taboos so teenagers can learn about sex education. Akshay plays the ‘messenger of god’ in the film. Yami Gautam portrays the role of a lawyer. She too was ‘disheartened’ when the film was given an ‘A’ certificate.

"Dunki box office collection day 20: Shah Rukh Khan-starrer aims to break this 3 Idiots record, trails Tiger 3 by Rs 17 crore","Dunki box office collection day 20: Rajkumar Hirani's comedy drama earned Rs 1.30 cr on its third Tuesday, and will soon overtake the lifetime collections of 3 Idiots.","Dunki box office collection day 20. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s third release of the year is now clocking numbers in the range of Rs 1 crore per day, as the comedy drama prepares to pretty much close its run at the box office. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Dunki netted Rs 1.3 cr on its third Tuesday.
Director Rajkumar Hirani’s film appears to have lost all steam after the holiday season bump. The film’s domestic total now stands at Rs 219.27 cr, which is around a third of what Shah Rukh’s Jawan earned last year, and less than half of what Pathaan made a year ago. Till Monday, the film had grossed Rs 447.70 cr worldwide according to official figures by Red Chillies Entertainment. Both Jawan and Pathaan grossed more than Rs 1000 crore globally.

After it crosses the Rs 450 cr mark in India, the film will then aim to break the record of another Hirani film, 3 Idiots. The Aamir Khan-starrer had grossed a whopping Rs 460 cr globally back in 2009. Dunki will cross 3 Idiots, but will fall short of Hirani’s last film, Sanju. The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer had minted Rs 588 cr worldwide in 2018.
On the global stage, Dunki is also likely to chase down the collections of Salman Khan-Katrina Kaif fronted Tiger 3, which had clocked Rs 464 cr last year. This, however, is still a disappointing number especially in the context of how box office in 2023 truly exploded, partly thanks to Shah Rukh himself.
Besides Jawan and Pathaan, Gadar 2 and Animal did business of Rs 686 cr and Rs 900 cr, respectively. Dunki has managed to deliver Rs 450 cr despite a clash with Salaar, and with average audience reception, though the expectations were sky high considering it was directed by Rajkumar Hirani.

However, it could not maintain the momentum built during its first week, and is now struggling to pass the Rs 400 crore mark domestically. The movie will be further impacted by the wide slate of releases during the Sankranti/Pongal weekend.
Salaar’s box office collection on day 19 was noted at Rs 2.15 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The film’s nett domestic collection now stands at Rs 397.80 crore, which means that it will finally pass the Rs 400 crore mark in the next day or two.

The chances of the Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran-led drama surpassing the collection of Rajinikanth’s 2.0, look bleak. Released in 2018, 2.0 had earned Rs 407.05 crore in India. Salaar will not even come close to matching Jawan (Rs 640.25 cr), Pathaan (Rs 543.09 cr), Animal (Rs 551.21 cr), and Gadar 2 (Rs 525.7 cr) at the domestic box office.

Salman Khan teaches democracy to Indians (and Pakistanis) in Tiger 3. Let that sink in,"The idea that the latest Salman Khan film is entirely based on the idea that democracy needs to be protected against people who declare themselves to be the sole custodian of the society, makes you hopeful for the future of Indian movies.","What if someone told you that the latest Salman Khan actioner can give you a ready reckoner on why democracy is better than dictatorship? Maneesh Sharma’s Tiger 3 is not just the popcorn-and-patriotism entertainer you always expected it to be, the latest Bhai film also expounds the idea that democracy needs to be protected against people who declare themselves to be the sole custodians of the country, making you hopeful for the future of Indian movies.
For many decades now, star-driven action films in India have been all about seeking revenge. It could be for the death of the hero’s beloved, or any other woman; it could be some childhood trauma that has scarred him for life and he is now looking for comeuppance; or, it could be all about seeking retribution for one’s country. The last one has been frequently revisited in our films and has appealed to the masses. The idea of patriotism, however, has changed a fair bit in our movies and in 2023, this was particularly evident. The year started with Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan where a Pakistani agent, played by Deepika Padukone, had the crowd cheering for her when she joined forces with SRK’s Indian agent to save humanity. A few months later, in Jawan, Shah Rukh gave a rousing monologue where he spoke directly to his fans about the importance of voting for the right candidate. The film did not shy away from taking shots at the corrupt troika of bureaucracy, politics and business. And the year ended with Salman Khan in Tiger 3 where his main mission was to save Pakistan from the evils of dictatorship.
Tiger 3 is an Indian film with an Indian hero at the center of its story but strangely enough, India has no stake in the story of this film. The many times when Tiger is asked as to why he cares about what’s happening in Pakistan, he comes up with a rather flimsy excuse, a reason he repeats many times in the film. It makes you wonder why Maneesh and Salman zeroed in on this subject for the third Tiger installment. In the film, the protagonist asks his crew, who are stand-ins for the audience, a question that immediately tells you about the central idea of this film. ‘Democracy or dictatorship?’ asks Tiger and his crew responds in unison, ‘democracy.’
ADVERTISEMENT
Salman Khan in a still from Tiger 3.
It is a rather strong statement when one of the most successful movie producing studios in the country decides to make a film where a choice as simple as this, at least for Indians who have been living in a democracy for over 75 years, needs to be reminded to the audience. The makers actually had to spell out why the need to have fair elections is essential and why democracy is better than having a dictator, the villain of this story, who might pretend to have good intentions. They underline that complete control in the hands of one person can’t be good for the health of a nation.
Tiger 3 also makes you wonder why, despite being set in Pakistan where an Indian agent is saving their democracy, there is no sense of superiority from any of the Indian characters? Our extremely loud news channels like to compare the two nations often and even before watching one of those shrill shows, you can presume that it’s all going to be about how India is better than its neighbour in the west. Tiger 3 gets an opportunity to do this many times over, yet chooses to walk away from it. Salman doesn’t break into a monologue telling Pakistanis how they should learn from India and its democracy, and the film does not suggest that saving Pakistan’s democracy will benefit India in any way. Was it because the writers and director felt that there was no need for this level of pettiness, or because they wanted their audience to actually think about the importance of democracy in a rapidly changing society?

By any measure, Tiger 3 is not a great film. The filmmaking is inept, the visual effects are laughable, the storytelling is convoluted and Salman can’t summon the charisma that makes his fans swoon, but, despite all of that, Tiger 3 makes a statement that many of its contemporaries would shy away from. Bollywood is often criticised for being apolitical or swaying the way political wind is blowing, but decades from now, when the cinema of 2023 is examined again, this sense of dissent from something as mainstream as Tiger 3 won’t go unnoticed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/opinion-entertainment/salman-khan-teaches-democracy-to-indians-and-pakistanis-in-tiger-3-let-that-sink-in-9101724/,entertainment
"Vijay Sethupathi says he was body-shamed in Bollywood and Tamil industries, feels ‘conscious’ attending events: ‘I wear chappals’","Actor Vijay Sethupathi opens up about his experience of being body-shamed, feeling conscious about wearing 'chappals' to events and how he constantly seeks validation from his fans.","It may be January, but for actor Vijay Sethupathi, it’s very much a Merry Christmas. The actor — clearly the new darling of Hindi cinema audiences — is awaiting the release of the Sriram Raghavan film opposite Katrina Kaif, and enjoying the adulation that is coming his way. After Jawan and Farzi, and a rich filmography in South films, Vijay is the go-to guy for strong author-backed roles, but accepts he is still getting used to everything else that comes as a package deal with working in films.
Lauded for breaking the set template of how a Hindi film actor looks with his real and relatable appearance, Vijay confessed that the newfound love he’s receiving for the way he looks acts like an “energy drink” for him but remembers the time he was body- shamed for it. In this interview with indianexpress.com, he also opens up on how he’s very conscious of what he’s wearing, because he has a habit of showing up in “chappals” at functions, get-togethers and meetings.

"Good Grief movie review: Sensitive but superficial, Dan Levy’s dissatisfying drama is standard Netflix fare","Good Grief movie review: Dan Levy's feature directorial debut aims for dramatic weight, but is too slight to warrant a recommendation.","There’s a thin line between self-awareness and self-satisfaction, and writer-director Dan Levy’s debut feature, Good Grief, isn’t able to straddle it. While awareness is a sign of emotional maturity, being smug about it is perhaps the most immature thing that a person can do. So, when a character in Good Grief makes an off-handed comment about a fictional movie in an early scene, describing it as ‘cloying but well-intentioned’, you can’t help but wonder if that’s Levy with his guard up, pre-empting some of the criticism that could be lobbed in the direction of his film, which is out now on Netflix.
It’s a weepy about a 30-something who experiences a terrible loss, and then goes to Paris to process it. Levy stars as Marc, whose husband Oliver — a famed writer whose books are often turned into blockbuster films — dies tragically in a car accident in the film’s opening scene. After hard-cutting to a tragicomic title card, however, Good Grief jumps forward by a year, and dishes out some more bad news to a still-grieving Marc. It’s the kind of bad news that completely alters his perception of his late husband, and compels him to make an impromptu international trip.

Raveena Tandon: ‘I was offered Karmma Calling ten years back’,"At Karmma Calling's trailer launch, Raveena Tandon shared how playing a grey character in the show was quite challenging.","Raveena Tandon is all set to play a grey character in Disney Plus Hotstar’s Karmma Calling. The show’s trailer dropped today, and the mystery thriller looks every bit gripping. At the press meet of Karmma Calling, the actor spoke about choosing to play a character with grey shades, and revealed that it was indeed challenging.
The actor shared, “Indira Kothari is very different from the real person that I am. So there was always a dilemma because I did not want my thoughts to reflect in this role. For years, I have tried to play different roles, whether Aranyak or KGF 2. People have seen me in different avatars. But this one (Karmma Calling) is the first, and it was challenging.”

The flood struck the area where Vishnu and Aamir were staying. For many it was shocker to see Aamir getting rescued from the flood along with Vishnu. Looks like during the hardship, the two actors became friends, and thus, Vishnu along with his wife were invited to Aamir Khan’s daughter Ira Khan’s wedding to Nupur Shikhare in Udaipur.
It is now clear why Vishnu is visibly absent from promoting his upcoming film Lal Salaam. The actor has gone out of town to attend the wedding in Udaipur along with his wife Jwala Gutta, who took to social media to share pictures from the wedding festivities.

‘Akshay Kumar was in tears’: Samrat Prithviraj director says he and actor have learnt not ‘to tamper with history’ after film failed,Chandraprakash Dwivedi said that Akshay Kumar had tears in his eyes after the failure of Samrat Prithviraj. The director said that producer Aditya Chopra ignored his suggestions during the making of the film.,"In 2022, when Akshay Kumar played the titular role in YRF’s Samrat Prithviraj, directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, it was expected to be a film that would bring back the audience to the theatres after the dry spell of the pandemic but, it backfired and how! Two years later, the director has now opened up about the colossal failure of the movie and expressed how he raised many objections to producer Aditya Chopra during the making but since he did not have much power, he could not control the situation.
In a conversation with Mukesh Khanna on his YouTube channel, Dwivedi said that even before the release of the movie, the audience had picked up on many elements of the film and were criticising it. “They were objecting to how Akshay was looking in the film. One of the objections was about how the actress (Manushi Chillar) was so much younger and Akshay, who was 55 then, was playing the role of a 26-year-old king. Then there was a question about his moustache as to why did he not have a real moustache. They even said that the frame of his body was nothing like Prithviraj. Today, honestly, I would like to confess that most of these objections were right,” he said.

I understood back then that he won’t stay here for long. He asked me one day about producer Pranlal Mehta. I told him he is a big producer. Shah Rukh said that he is getting a lot of calls from the Pranlal. I said, ‘You are getting calls from him, go and do that project with him.’ He told me that he will wait and see, but I asked him not to wait any longer and just do the project. He then decided to think about it for 2-3 days before responding to the producer. After 4-5 days, he told me that he won’t be doing that project and I was shocked. I told him, ‘Pagal ho gaeya hai (You have gone mad). You don’t know how big is the production house and the director helming the film has delivered hits in the past.'”

Salaar box office collection day 19 early report: Prabhas film struggles to surpass Rs 400 crore mark and this Jailer record,"Salaar's current India nett is significantly lower than some of the biggest recent blockbusters like Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan & Pathaan, Ranbir Kapoor's Animal, Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 and Rajinikanth's Jailer.","With just two days left until the commencement of the Sankranti/Pongal weekend, during which a slew of films in different South Indian languages will be released, Prashanth Neel’s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is struggling to surpass the Rs 400 crore mark in the domestic market.

On Day 18, Salaar had minted Rs 2.4 crore in the domestic market. Globally, the film has earned Rs 687.51 crore, toppling Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2, which earned Rs 686 crore worldwide.

Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain’s relationship won’t survive outside the house: Anurag Dobhal,Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain have been making headlines due to their frequent and intense arguments on reality show Bigg Boss 17.,"Recently ousted contestant from Bigg Boss 17, Anurag Dobhal, popularly known as The UK07 Rider, has shared his observations on the show’s much-discussed couple, Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain. The couple has been making headlines due to their frequent and intense arguments on the reality show.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Anurag expressed his thoughts on the dynamics of Ankita and Vicky’s relationship. He said, “A husband and wife had to keep in mind what kind of a relationship they are showing to the audience. I will give an example of Neil and Aishwarya. They got a feedback on their relationship and they worked on that. They also fought a lot and there was disrespect also, but they didn’t talk about divorce. When you say such things on national television, it can’t be taken back. Now, since they have talked about divorce, people don’t trust their relationship. I feel Vicky has disrespected Ankita a lot and she too have slapped him on the national television. Who does that? I don’t think this relationship will survive outside the house.”

Konkona Sensharma recalls ‘literally holding back tears’ while shooting a ‘sensational’ commercial film: ‘Was hoping that it never releases’,"Actor Konkona Sensharma recalled how embarrassed she was early in her career, about doing a 'sensational' film about a teenager stalking an older man.","Actor Konkona Sensharma recalled how embarrassed she was about doing a Bengali-language thriller early in her career, and admitted that she was secretly praying that it never sees the light of day. In a chat with her Killer Soup co-star Manoj Bajpayee for Indian Express, Konkona admitted that she was a ‘snob’, and said that to some degree, she still is. “It’s okay to have high standards,” she said, as she narrated an anecdote about bagging her first role as an adult, while she was still in college.
She said, “I got offered this film by a very lovely man, Subrata Sen. And the film went on to do very well. It was a Bengali thriller. It was about this teenager who was in love with an older man, and it was a little sensational type. Like negative character, stalking this older man. And I used to look down on all this. Here we were, doing seminars on theatre of the absurd, and the Dadaist movement, and surrealist movement and all that. And then, in Calcutta, between my second year and third year… It was a commercial film, sometimes quite silly. I literally remember standing in a studio in Calcutta and holding back tears, and hoping that this film never releases.”

Manoj Bajpayee recalls being mocked mercilessly for his poor English: ‘All my roommates would make fun of me’,"Actor Manoj Bajpayee opened up about the mocking that he suffered for his poor spoken English as a student in Delhi University, and how driven he was to reshape himself in a different person.","Actor Manoj Bajpayee said that he wanted to ‘transform’ himself into a whole new person after enrolling at Delhi University. He said that he’d never experienced anything like it, coming from a small town in Bihar. Manoj credited DU as being an ‘instigator’ in his life, and said that during his time at the university, he discovered ‘urban behaviour patterns, education, knowledge, diction…’ Chatting with his Killer Soup co-star Konkona Sensharma for Indian Express, Manoj said that he wasn’t fluent in English when he first arrived in Delhi, and that this was a source of great amusement for his fellow students.
But, he said, he had a self-deprecating streak, and would often allow himself to be mocked for his poor English-speaking skills. Many years later, he revealed, one of his old college roommates got in touch with him and said that he felt terrible for what happened. “I’m from Bihar, so our pronunciation was all haywire. DU has played a major part in shaping me,” he said. “I always had this feeling that I’m lacking a lot, coming from a place that isn’t exposed to this world. That sense of urgency was there in my mind that I had to reshape myself very fast, I have to adjust into this society very fast, I have to understand its ways very fast…”

During an interview Ahmad Ali Butt, Fawad explained the distinction between Indian television shows and Pakistani dramas and shed light on the factors that make the latter resonate with the Indian audience. He said. “They make soap operas. They don’t make mini-series. They don’t make a 10-20 episode series. They used to make it in the past. Many actors, including Shah Rukh Khan did a series called Fauji, he did one or two TV projects. I believe Nana Patekar also did TV before entering films. I think during that time we also used to watch their dramas. Tab Doordarshan pakda jata tha thoda thoda in some places (We used to get signals of Doordarshan in some places). I am not saying that they evolved into a 24 hour The Bold And The Beautiful, Santa Barbara television presence… long episode soap operas…we finish the series in 26 episodes.”

While some view him as overly involved, others commend his dedication to the craft.

Speaking about Aamir’s work ethic, Mushtaq said, “I have done many films with Aamir Khan. In any film, doesn’t matter who is the director or producer, he is fully involved. The best thing about Aamir Khan is that he wants the film to be good. He wants the scene to be good and he wants that if a scene has four artists they get their moments. For instance, if I have a scene then that will remain my scene. This is a big thing. When it is said that he interferes that’s not true.”

Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video: On letting loose and playing the ‘woman card’,"Sajni Shinde's shame isn't her own, it's one we have all shared. It's the sort of shame a woman is expected to feel when a teacher points out an 'attention-drawing' brassiere, or when a nosy neighbour inquires about a male visitor.","It’s a tale that is all too familiar. And yet, the familiarity offers no comfort. When a young, unassuming teacher’s dance video goes viral, her life combusts. A closer look, however, reveals that the ramifications were not as sudden. As Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video delves into the life of its titular character, the supposed disgraced teacher, the viewer is met with the disquieting realisation that the mores and morality that we often bind ourselves in were corroding Shinde’s life already.
In many ways Sajini Shinde’s (played by Radhika Madan) ordeal was her own. A teacher from a respectable school in Pune, who is later seen in a viral video dancing with two shirtless men on the bar top, isn’t a predicament most of us find ourselves in. But being called out for straying far from the boundaries set for women by the society is a feeling many women are familiar with. Letting loose is a privilege — one that only a few of us enjoy, and mostly in the confines of our homes.

In an interview with Film Companion, she was asked if Merry Christmas was difficult leap for her, after having played ‘morally upright’ women in most of her past films. She said, “Just because a lot of the films I’ve been a part of haven’t portrayed that, it doesn’t mean that me as a person doesn’t understand it, or doesn’t relate to it, or hasn’t experienced it. A lot of it came from discussions with Sriram sir. After our first meeting, where he narrated the film, he told me to write my own backstory for the character. He said, ‘Tell me what you think, where she came from, who she is, why she does what she does’. That process really helped me understand the world…”

Is Mammootty a part of Abraham Ozler? Will there be an Ozler 2?

Kombari Vettapuli song hints Dhanush’s Captain Miller was a demure guy in the past,"A new single from Dhanush's Captain Miller is out, and it seems to be from the backstory of the lead hero when he was a shy young lad. ","Captain Miller’s trailer assured that the film, like Arun Matheshwaran’s earlier movies and like every other star vehicle these days, will be a blood bath. The trailer’s background score, like in the trailers of Kamal Haasan’s Viswaproopam and Vikram’s Dhruvanatchathiram, was made of bullet and bomb sounds. The promo teemed with bodies blowing up, heads getting pulverised by bullets and blood splashes. However, the new song from Captain Miller tells there is a calm (before the storm) segment in the film.
Titled “Kombari Vettapuli”, the song, composed by GV Prakash and sung by Dhee, is a folksy number. Of course with Dhee’s rendition, it effortlessly generates a rural flavour. And the stills show Dhanush as this smitten young and working-class guy, who is lost in the beauty of Priya Arul Mohan’s character. She, on the other hand, seems to be a girl of an affluent background. However, what tells more about the film is lyricist Vivek’s lines.

All able-bodied men in South Korea aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months as part of efforts to defend against nuclear-armed North Korea.

Ananya Panday: ‘You have to block mindless trolling but some criticism is important feedback’,Ananya Panday opened up about the importance of learning from experiences and welcoming constructive feedback.,"You can’t get too carried away by either praise or hate, says actor Ananya Panday, who is earning rave reviews for her performance in Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, a film she describes as a relevant story that captures the impact of social media on youth.
Panday, who made her movie debut with 2019’s Student of the Year 2, has often been targeted by online trolls for her comments, fashion choices and sometimes, just for hailing from a film family.
The 25-year-old, who is the daughter of actor Chunky Panday, said she has been vocal about people expressing themselves and learning from their mistakes. She believes whatever she has experienced since she became an actor has contributed to her growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If I hadn’t been exposed to those emotions, I would probably not be able to perform a certain way. So I’m grateful for whatever’s happened because I have been allowed to express myself through my work. And, some criticism is actually helpful and important feedback. Obviously, you have to block out the mindless trolling,” Panday told PTI in an interview.
Asked about the praise that has come her way post Kho Gaye Hum Kahan and 2022’s Gehraiyaan, the actor said she has learned to take all feedback in her stride.
“I feel like people’s perceptions change every Friday. You can’t get too carried away by praise or by hate. You have to keep working hard, that’s the best you can do. You can’t change the way people speak, so you can only work on yourself. That’s what I have learned,” added Panday, who also runs a digital social responsibility initiative against online bullying.
She is happy that people have connected with her character of Ahana, a workaholic marketing executive, who feels stuck in her relationship and career, and takes to social media to seek validation. Panday said the film, also starring Siddhant Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav, was one of the “best working experiences” she has had. Netflix’s Kho Gaye Hum Kahan is directed by Arjun Varain Singh and released on December 26.

“I want to be able to play characters that go beyond generation, that people always remember, people feel happy when they think about and they feel like they can relate to,” said the actor, recalling growing up on films such as Jaane Tu Yaa Jaane Naa, Ye Jawani Hai Deewani and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan captures the pitfalls of hyper-connectivity in the internet era and the constant need for validation from strangers through the story of three friends, who are unable to move forward in life for different reasons whether it’s Panday’s Ahana, Chaturvedi’s Imaad, a stand-up comic hiding a tragedy, or Gourav’s Neil, a fitness instructor trying to make it big.
Through the film, Panday said, they wanted to understand the current generation and depict “what’s going on around all of us”. “We all felt it, all the actors, the director… Everyone felt like this was happening in their lives and people weren’t talking about it. It is such a relevant issue because it’s not just about social media. It’s about the way relationships have changed.”
Ananya Panday, who is an active Instagram user but is “too scared” of X, said the film helped her relook at her own relationship with social media. “At the end of the day, everyone has to realise that it is just for fun and it can be all taken away with just a click of a button. You just shut your phone and it’s all gone. And, there’s a real world out there with actual people and connections to form.”

Panday has received acclaim for some of the emotional scenes in the movie, but the actor said those came easy to her as opposed to fun moments in the film.
“Strangely, for me, the toughest part as an actor is to laugh on screen. And, this is one of those films where there were moments where the friends are hanging out and we had to laugh and I just couldn’t do it,” the actor recalled.
What helped her was a workshop with acting coach Atul Mongia. “He does this exercise where he does ‘every degree of an emotion’, where you have to go from zero to hundred. I could do anger, sadness, everything, but I just couldn’t do happiness and laughter. He made me sit in the middle of a room. First, he made me cry and then, he made me laugh,” she said.
Ananya Panday’s upcoming projects include Vikramaditya Motwane’s film Control and her debut web series Call Me Bae, a fun chick-flick, and an untitled film.

“As an actor, it’s gratifying that directors like Zoya (Akhtar – co-writer of ‘Kho Gaye…’), Shakun (Batra – ‘Gehraiyaan’), and Vikram sir… They see something in me and want to work with me. To me, that’s the best reward as an actor to work with people where I can learn something and grow,” she said.

The clip begins with Arjun and Ranveer (with his back to the camera) doing the hook step of the catchy Khalibali song from Padmaavat. Ranveer and Arjun are then seen dancing wildly to the Bajirao Mastani banger Malhari. Again, the duo is filmed doing the energetic hook step as guests in the background also groove with them.

"A chaotic Golden Globes night had a bit of everything: The silly, the serious, and Taylor Swift, too","One decisive trend emerged at the Golden Globe Awards 2024: In the great Barbenheimer showdown of awards season 2024, round one went to the “heimer” part as Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer won in several major categories.","They may not have had lukewarm chardonnay on the tables, as nominee Jennifer Lawrence had predicted. But the 81st Golden Globes had a bit of everything else: Some silliness, some seriousness, a bit of history, a few good jokes and many bad ones, loads of stars — and one Taylor Swift, who didn’t ascend the podium but still made her presence known as perhaps only Swift can.
One decisive trend emerged: In the great Barbenheimer showdown of awards season 2024, round one went to the “heimer” part. Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic Oppenheimer dominated the evening, among its wins the prizes for best drama, best director for Nolan, and best actor (Cillian Murphy ) and supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr). Greta Gerwig’s candy-coloured Barbie, meanwhile, lost to upset victor Poor Things in the comedy/musical category, but won the new cinematic and box office achievement award, as well as best song for Billie Eilish’s wistful “What Was I Made For.”
ICYMI | Golden Globes 2024: Christopher Nolan remembers ‘dear friend’ Heath Ledger in acceptance speech
It would be unwise to count Barbie out, but it was a disappointing night for her fans, and also for another fearsome force: Swifties. The pop superstar, who spent 2023 smashing all records in sight, lost out on her fifth Globe nomination. But she stunned on the carpet in shimmering Gucci green and later created a meme-worthy moment when she reacted with a seemingly icy glare to a joke about her by host Jo Koy.

Swift was not alone in her displeasure; at one point the jokes were falling flat enough for Koy to stop and explain that he’d had only 10 days to prepare.

The crowd laughed harder at Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig, who made an amusing bit of pretending — insisting — that the ceremony was “a serious night.” The joke was that few actually take the ceremony seriously. Noted presenter Mark Hamill: “It’s the only awards show with an open bar.”
But it was indeed a serious note that served as an emotional highpoint: Lily Gladstone, of Killers of the Flower Moon, became the first Indigenous winner of best actress in a drama, speaking in the Blackfeet language and reminding the crowd that there are still significant advances to be celebrated. Some notable moments of the evening:

A bumpy Start
Koy got a few laughs with a joke about the lengthy Oppenheimer, saying, “I needed another hour.” But as the monologue went on, it was clear that the comic needed something else: sharper jokes from the writers. Cameras caught negative reactions from celebs like Harrison Ford and Selena Gomez, and the Barbie team did not appear amused when he noted that Oppenheimer was based on serious material but their own film was based on “a plastic doll with big boobies.”
Koy sought to defend himself. “Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue?” He added: “I wrote some of these, and they’re the ones you’re laughing at.”

They’re not called that…
When Da’Vine Joy Randolph won for her acclaimed supporting actress performance in The Holdovers, she duly thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Only problem: The HFPA is now defunct, and many in the audience responded audibly: “They’re not called that.” After several years of turmoil that followed the revelation that the HFPA had no Black members, the Golden Globes were acquired last year by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions and turned into a for-profit venture. Some 300 entertainment journalists now vote for the awards. Later, Randolph spoke about the vibe of the evening. “It’s a party in there,” she said. “It’s a good time. We got through the pandemic. We stuck through our two strikes. There’s a sense of buzz in there.”
…And he wasn’t called that
Winning an early award for best supporting actor, Downey Jr told the crowd he had taken a beta-blocker, so “this is going to be a breeze.” He then misspoke the name of his character, government official Lewis Strauss. “Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summertime saying that I was, I quote, ‘unrecognisably subtle as Leonard Strauss,’” the actor said. “To my fellow nominees, let’s not pretend this is a compliment.”

‘Succession’ succeeds successfully
To nobody’s surprise, Succession, the HBO drama about the Roy family dynasty, had lots of success, winning best drama as well as major acting awards for Kieran Culkin, Matthew Macfadyen and Sarah Snook. Macfadyen said he’d enjoyed every second of playing the “weird and wonderful human grease stain” that was Tom Wambsgans. Culkin, who played troubled son Roman Roy, told the crowd how he’d been nominated for a Golden Globe 20 years ago and never thought he’d be back, and playfully taunted his co-nominee, Pedro Pascal of The Last of Us, quipping: “Suck it, Pedro. Mine!” And Snook, who played Shiv Roy, ascended the stage and said: “Oh, wow. I was kind of hoping I didn’t have to get up. Kieran’s usually better at these speeches, right? Don’t you want to get up instead?”

Don’t be mean
Also on the TV side, Hulu’s kitchen-based The Bear won big – taking best comedy series. Jeremy Allen White won for the second time, and Ayo Edebiri won her first Globe for her own lead performance, charming the ballroom crowd when she thanked the assistants of her agents and managers. “To the people who answer my emails, you’re the real ones,” she said, She added: “If I forgot to thank you, I’m sorry. Unless you were mean or something. Okay, bye!”

If looks could kill
When Barbie won the new award for cinematic and box office achievement, it beat out the nominee many thought would win: “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.” Still, Swift, whose attendance was in question until her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, was ruled inactive for the day’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, was a glamorous addition to the evening (Bruce Springsteen was there, too) in her custom Gucci gown. The camera cut to her several times, but she was not happy when Koy joked that the difference between the Globes and the NFL was that the NFL had more reaction shots of Swift. She stared ahead and took a sip of her drink.

The importance of words
It wasn’t far from anyone’s minds that Hollywood is emerging from historic actors and writers strikes, and one of the more clever presenter bits highlighted the importance of screenwriters. Daniel Kaluuya, Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld joked that they’d asked for their segment to be written not by writers but by studio executives. “What is up, Shameik,” Kaluuya said, robotically. “Not much, Daniel. How are you, Hailee?” Moore said. “I am relatable,” Steinfeld said. The screenplay award they presented had a surprise winner: Justine Triet, writer-director of Anatomy of a Fall, beating out both Barbie and Oppenheimer.

A historic win
The evening’s emotional highpoint came with the penultimate award, when Gladstone won best actress in a drama for Martin Scorsese’s epic Killers of the Flower Moon, becoming the first Indigenous winner in the category. She opened her speech in the Blackfeet language, explaining backstage that “it was one of the more natural things I could do in the moment.” In her speech, Gladstone, who played Osage community member Mollie Burkhart, pronounced her win historic and said: “This is for every little rez kid, every little urban kid, every little Native kid out there who has a dream, who is seeing themselves represented and our stories told — by ourselves, in our own words — with tremendous allies and tremendous trust from and with each other.”

“The only time I’ve ever been on this stage before was accepting one of these on behalf of our dear friend, Heath Ledger, and that was complicated and challenging for me,” Nolan said. “In the middle of speaking, I got all stuck, and Robert Downey Jr. caught my eye and gave me a look of love and support — the same look he’s giving me now.”
Heath Ledger died at the age of 28 of an accidental overdose after filming of The Dark Knight was complete but before the movie was released. His haunting portrayal of the Joker earned him numerous posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, as per Variety.

“I thought it would be simpler accepting for myself. But, as a director, I realise I can only accept this on behalf of people. As directors, we bring people together and we try to get them to give their best,” he added.
The biopic, set during World War II, follows Oppenheimer, known as the “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” during a period in history when he understood that testing the atomic bomb would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world, yet he pushed the button anyway.

Gladstone and DiCaprio walked the red carpet with their respective mothers. After her win backstage, she paid homage to her parents for supporting her dreams. The actor said her father watched from home, where they would have a “big ol’ feast.”
“Every time I’ve felt a level of guilt or it wasn’t really possible, my mom and my dad my whole life never once questioned that this is what I was meant to do,” said Gladstone, who is an only child. “They would always support me when it was the times of famine and the times of feast.” It’s “a beautiful community, nation, that encouraged me to keep going, keep doing this,” Gladstone said of the Blackfeet Nation.

“It’s often how I introduce myself in a new group of people, especially when it’s significant,” she said. “It was one of the more natural things I could do in the moment.”
On the subject of a possible Oscar win, Gladstone told The Associated Press: “It would be an incredible moment in my life, but it would mean so much more than just me.” “It is, of course, something I have to think about, insofar as I would just really love to speak some of my language — and teach myself a little bit more of my language — to have and to hold in that moment,” she continued.
Gladstone is the second Native actress to receive a nomination at the Globes after Irene Bedard, who received a nod for the 1995 television movie “Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee.”
“I don’t have words,” Gladstone said. “I’m so grateful that I can speak even a little bit of my language, which I’m not fluent in, up here, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera.”

Speaking of the award, Gladstone said: “It doesn’t belong to just me. I’m holding it right now. I’m holding it with all my beautiful sisters in the film.”

Wong, who executive produced the series, received widespread critical acclaim and is an Emmy nominee for her performance as Amy Lau, a tightly wound entrepreneur, wife, and mother whose simmering self-loathing leads to an escalating battle of mutually assured destruction opposite Steven Yeun’s character of scammy contractor Danny.

“It is all so amazing. All this couldn’t have happened without Sandeep Reddy Vanga. He had this vision to create this film with conviction,” he said.

Dimri, who essayed the role of Rannvijay’s mistress Zoya in the film, echoed Deol’s sentiments.
“I want to thank Sandeep sir from my heart for giving me this opportunity and believing in me,” she said.
Anil Kapoor called leading lady Mandanna as the film’s “lucky mascot”.
“Film is a director’s medium. It was Sandeep’s vision. Rashmika is the lucky mascot. Pushpa and now Animal, always lucky. I told you Bobby that this will change your life,” he added.

She mentioned how she often thinks about this 'silly business of smiles and tears'.,"Actor Kangana Ranaut is known for not mincing her words.

She wrote about how fascinated fans get when they notice their favourite star in public and think of it as a “miracle”.
Taking to Instagram, Kangana wrote, “The best thing about being an actor is whenever people see you at the airport, in the lounge, in the aircraft, or even in a shop, restaurant, simply strolling around in the streets, their face lights up with a big unexpected smile as if a small miracle has happened. As if a good omen has been bestowed upon them as if the glamorous world of celluloid has collided with their mundane life leaving a haze of stardust.”

"Golden Globe Awards 2024 prediction: Barbie and Oppenheimer expected to clean up awards, Killers of the Flower Moon likely to register big win","The Golden Globes are back on CBS with a revamped ceremony hosted by Jo Koy. Despite controversies, stars like Taylor Swift and movies such as Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer are expected to shine.","The Golden Globes are back from the dead, and ready to party. The long-running award show will again have the champagne flowing Sunday night when the 81st Globes begin at 8 p.m. EST. Much will look the same as always when well-attired celebrities gather at the Beverly Hilton International Ballroom in Los Angeles.
But the Globes are returning sans the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which was disbanded after years of diversity and ethical scandals. The Globes also lost its longtime network home. This year’s show is being broadcast on CBS in a one-year deal. Can the revamped Globes recapture the bubbly, irreverent spirit of all those shows hosted by Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler? Those broadcasts help turn the Globes into the third biggest award show of the year, after the Oscars and the Grammys.
The Globes’ glitzy good time enabled many to overlook the impropriates of an award show that often doubled as a punchline. Regardless of the behind-the-scenes drama, most viewers tune in for the dresses, the speeches and the stars — of which there is a bountiful array this year. Among the expected attendees is Taylor Swift, whose “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is nominated for the newly launched “cinematic and box-office achievement” award. Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, will be playing with the Kansas City Chiefs at nearby SoFi Stadium earlier in the day.

Swift, along with the stars of likely winners Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” are some of the main attractions in Sunday’s ceremony, hosted by Jo Koy. The comedian, who isn’t expected to strike as caustic a tone as previous hosts, will be tasked with leading the Globes into a new era. Even the menu ( Nobu is catering ) has been flipped.
HOW TO WATCH
CBS will air the ceremony live after an afternoon of NFL broadcasts. The show will also be streamed live via the Showtime plan on Paramount+. The Globes can also be watched through live TV streaming services that include CBS in their lineup, like Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV. Red carpet coverage will be online. The official pre-show will be hosted by “Entertainment Tonight” and Variety beginning 6:30 Eastern. The red carpet will stream on the Golden Globes site, ETOnline.com, Variety’s website and social platforms and other Penske Media publications.
WHAT’S IN STORE FOR THE SHOW
Announced presenters include Oprah Winfrey, Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck, America Ferrara, Michelle Yeoh, Issa Rae, Florence Pugh, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfriend.
You won’t see two awards usually handed out at the Globes: the Cecil B. DeMille Award or the Carol Burnett Award. Both of those tribute honours aren’t being given this year, though two new categories are: the blockbuster award and one for a stand-up comedy special.
THE CONTENDERS

Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, the biggest movie of the year with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, comes in the lead-nominee with nine nods, including Best Comedy or musical, Best Director for Gerwig, Best Actress for Margot Robbie, Best Supporting Actor for Ryan Gosling, and three original song nominations.
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is close behind with eight nominations, including for Best Drama, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor for Cillian Murphy and supporting nods for Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.
Barbie and Oppenheimer are expected to clean up, but look for possible wins from front-runners including Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon, Emma Stone for Poor Things and Da’Vine Joy Randolph for “The Holdovers.
On the TV side, HBO’s Succession leads with nine nominations. The Bear and “Only Murders in the Building” follow with five apiece.
THE GLOBES COMEBACK
ADVERTISEMENT
A few years ago, the Golden Globes were on the cusp of collapse. After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA had no Black members, Hollywood boycotted the organization. The 2022 Globes were all but cancelled and taken off TV. After reforms, the Globes returned to NBC last year in a one-year deal, but the show was booted to Tuesday evening. With Jerrod Carmichael hosting, the telecast attracted 6.3 million viewers, a new low on NBC and a far cry from the 20 million that once tuned in.
The Golden Globes were acquired by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which Penske Media owns, and turned into a for-profit venture. The HFPA (which typically numbered around 90 voters) was dissolved and a new group of some 300 entertainment journalists from around the world now vote for the awards.

Questions remain about the Globes’ long-term future, but their value to Hollywood studios remains providing a marketing boost to awards contenders. (The Oscars won’t be held until March 10.) This year, because of the actors and writers strikes, the Globes are airing ahead of the Emmys, which were postponed to Jan. 15.
With movie ticket sales still 20% off the pre-pandemic pace and the industry facing a potentially rocky 2024 at the box office, Hollywood needs the Golden Globes as much as it ever has.

Despite the relatively smaller screen time, Tripathi’s impactful performance resonated with audiences and even garnered attention from real-life gangsters who saw Sultan aka Tripathi as an idol.
During an interview with India TV, Tripathi was asked if the rumour of gangsters approaching him after he played the character of Sultan in Gangs of Wasseypur is true. Admitting the same, the actor said in Hindi, “Many gangsters approached me. At that time, many gangsters in North and South India started thinking of me as their idol. They thought Sultan does what he speaks in the film, and he also has a good character in the film. So, they started liking Sultan a lot. Many writers after that, who would come to narrate stories to me, would be scared that I would take out a knife from my pocket.”

Javed Akhtar bashes Yash Chopra’s Jab Tak Hai Jaan for ‘ridiculous’ portrayal of modern woman: ‘When the heroine says she will sleep with…’,Javed Akhtar expressed the ongoing struggle to define the modern woman in the Hindi cinema. He took examples of Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit and how they never got big roles in their careers.,"Javed Akhtar delved into the evolving concept of the modern woman in Hindi cinema in a recent interview. Reflecting on the historical depiction of women as submissive and quiet, Akhtar acknowledged the industry’s shift towards questioning these stereotypes. Despite this evolution, Akhtar expressed the ongoing struggle to define the modern woman. The screenwriter took examples of iconic actors Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit and how they never got big roles in their careers. He also bashed Yash Chopra’s film, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, for its ‘ridiculous’ idea of an empowered woman.
Speaking about it on ABP Majha, Akhtar said, “Who is the new woman? We are not clear about it. There are two reasons for it. Those who are liberal, if they define this as a modern woman, other liberals will question them. Those who are conservative, if they define it, they feel that they will lose a lot of their territory. So, they don’t want to do it. There were so many talented women -Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit – they weren’t any less talented than any of the actors, but they didn’t get a big role in their whole career. For instance, they didn’t get roles like Mother India, Bandini and Sujata. It is because people don’t know what is an ideal woman.”

When Irrfan Khan’s wife Sutapa thanked Ekta Kapoor’s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi for his international stardom: ‘We would have become producers…’,"On Irrfan Khan's 57th birth anniversary, here's recalling the time that Ekta Kapoor's rise to stardom in the television industry pushed Irrfan towards international projects.","Late actor Irrfan Khan started working in the entertainment industry from the early days of television in India and before he could make his way into films, in India and abroad, the late actor was working in a few TV shows and trying to make a mark. In Shubhra Gupta’s book, Irrfan: A Life in Movies, his wife Sutapa Sikdar spoke about this phase of his life and recalled that while Irrfan was doing some great work in a few episodes of Bestsellers, he had had a few boring experiences on other television shows, like Chandrakanta. At one point, Irrfan even left Chandrakanta but was called back by the makers because the audience loved his style of acting.
Sutapa, in the book recalled, that she was turning into a producer for television and was in the process of putting a show together for Star. But her producing dreams came to a standstill as Ekta Kapoor’s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi happened and changed TV forever. This affected Irrfan’s career in a way that he never even imagined. “I must thank Ekta Kapoor for one thing. We were doing one show for Star, which was a proper TV show. We were the producers – we wrote it and went to Delhi as new producers who will be doing this revolutionary, pathbreaking show. We shot four episodes and then Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi came,” she shared.

Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, ek aadmi ne likha, do aadmi ne compose kiya, 2 ladkiyon ne dance kiya, ek cameraman ne shoot kiya. Yeh 8-10 log thodi problem hai. Problem yeh hai ki yeh gaana samaj mein superhit ho gaya tha. Yeh crore logon ko aacha laga tha. Yeh hume darr lagta hai. (People started telling me, ‘Sir, what kind of songs are being made these days?’  Songs are created by 6-7 individuals. For Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, one person wrote it, two people composed it, two girls danced to it, and one cameraman shot it. These 8-10 people are not a problem. The problem is that this song became a superhit and was liked by crores of people. This scares us.)”

In a recent interview, when Manoj was asked about his extended tiffs with Anurag Kashyap, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Anubhav Sinha, and Hansal Mehta, the actor said that since they are all friends, they tend to fight with each other sometimes. The actor, however, admitted that he had an uncontrollable temper when he lived in Delhi before moving to Mumbai, and would often get in fights in local DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses in the capital.
“I used to get really furious in DTC buses. Because whenever I would see that someone was misbehaving with a woman, and if the woman was protesting, then I would really beat that guy up. Most of my fights in Delhi have happened because of this. I have no regrets over that,” he shared with Jist. When the interviewer brought up Manoj’s fights in Bihar, the actor brushed it aside, claiming that it was teenage angst that compelled him to get into altercations.

He wrote, “Be like Rohit Shetty. Be like my boss KJ. Always acknowledge your writers. Stop hogging all credits. Some directors have a terrible habit of forgetting their writers. Don’t be a d**k. A film which released on ott recently and is getting lot of love, nobody knows who has written it or the book on which it is based. Because the director remembers only him doing everything in all his interviews.”

Saif Ali Khan was ‘upset’ when Sriram Raghavan told him that he’d changed his mind about casting him in Merry Christmas: ‘I want to clarify…’,"Sriram Raghavan had to tell Saif Ali Khan that he'd changed his mind about casting him in Merry Christmas, after initially approaching him with the role.","Filmmaker Sriram Raghavan’s upcoming film, Merry Christmas, stars the unlikely pair Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi. However, the filmmaker had earlier considered Saif Ali Khan for the lead role, but while working on the script, he discovered that Saif wouldn’t be right for the part. The filmmaker clarified his earlier comments about the subject, which he said were misconstrued to suggest that he’d rejected Saif for the role.
During an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Sriram said, “Actually, I had this story for about three years. I met Katrina and she said lets do something. Then, after Andhadhun, I decided to go ahead with it. Initially, when I was looking at it, I was looking at a Hindi film, no Tamil version and all. I was thinking of Saif because I have worked with him in a couple of movies earlier. So, I thought it might be interesting. I met him and he liked the subject, he liked it very much.”

‘Shah Rukh Khan and I were never close friends’: Manoj Bajpayee says he doesn’t cross paths with SRK any more,Manoj Bajpayee and Shah Rukh Khan trained under acting coach Barry John in New Delhi before they became leading actors in Bollywood.,"Actors Manoj Bajpayee and Shah Rukh Khan can trace their origins to the same acting group in Delhi, but the two chose very different styles of cinema as their careers progressed. While Shah Rukh emerged as one of the biggest stars in Indian cinema history, Manoj made parallel cinema and off-beat characters his strength. He said that their worlds are so different now that the two of them don’t even bump into each other anymore.
Manoj has earlier narrated an incident from their Delhi days, when he and Shah Rukh went to a club together but the Gangs of Wasseypur actor was denied entry because he wasn’t wearing the proper footwear. Manoj described that as a ‘one-off incident’ as he downplayed their closeness even back in the day.

When AR Rahman wondered whether Slumdog Millionaire deserved the Oscar Award,"AR Rahman, in a felicitation ceremony, spoke about winning the Oscar. The legendary composer was surprised that Slumdog Millionaire won him two Oscars.","When AR Rahman won not just one but two Oscars for the song “Jai Ho” and the original score of Slumdog Millionaire in 2009, Tamilians were ecstatic. The composer further made the state of Tamil Nadu proud by speaking in his mother tongue on the most prestigious stage. “Ella Pugazhum Iraivanukae (All praise is for the lord),” became the most popular sentence in Tamil and continues to be. However, when the dust settled, everyone wondered if “Jai Ho” of all other AR Rahman’s brilliant songs deserved the much-coveted award. Even the ardent fans of Rahman aren’t huge fans of the album. And the surprising fact is that even AR Rahman shares the same doubt. In a felicitation ceremony that was conducted for him in Chennai after he bagged two Oscars, the composer pondered over the same question.
The ceremony was attended by all the Tamil music legends including MS Viswanathan and Ilaiyaraaja, who were two huge inspirations of Rahman. Harris Jeyaraj and other musicians were also present at the event. When Rahman took the stage, he said, “Raja Sir said this is because of the blessings of my parents, which is true. I am harvesting the profits of all the work done by my parents. For the past ten years, at every Oscars, I kept seeing either a Japanese composer, or a Chinese composer, or an Italian composer getting awards, and I used to wonder are there no composers here at all? Here we have Raja Sir and MSV Sir and KV Mahadevan Sir, Madhan Mohan, Roshan… but they all didn’t need it. Beyond that, they received a lot of love. When Raja Sir stood up, you all made so much noise… that reflected the respect you have for him. This is bigger than Oscar.”

Fan commends Vijay Sethupathi for his ‘simplicity’; Merry Christmas star wants to end this misconception once and for all: ‘What I’m wearing is actually expensive’,"Marking the first collaboration between Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi, Sriram Raghavan's Merry Christmas was shot simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil with distinct supporting casts.","Director Sriram Raghavan’s highly-anticipated thriller Merry Christmas, starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles, is all set for release on Friday.

Manoj Bajpayee is displeased that people didn’t watch Joram in theatres: ‘It made Rs 15-20 lakh per day; we wanted to experiment’,"Manoj Bajpayee emphasised on the importance of 'real cinema', as he broke down the finances of his recent film Joram.","Actor Manoj Bajpayee recently expressed his displeasure at audiences for not turning up in large numbers to watch his 2023 film Joram in theatres. He said that while people spend thousands of rupees on mainstream entertainers, they don’t watch “real cinema”. This trend, he said in a new interview, is endangering the art form itself.
In an interview with Jist, while discussing Joram’s box office performance, he said while gesturing at the audience, “Inmein se kisi ne nahi dekhi hogi (no one here must have watched the film). I am telling you, yeh yetharth hai (it is a possibility). We had purposely released Joram in very few theatres because we wanted to gauge if the audiences’ brains work the same way as we think, or if they only want to watch other kind of films. People who went to watch the film really liked it, they themselves are promoting it by word or mouth, telling ten other people to watch it. But the majority of the people don’t believe in such films, and even if they do, they want to watch them for free. The same people will take a loan to watch other kinds of films, they are okay doing that, it’s their taste. Our fight is about this. We want to see how interested they are in watching the kind of films we want to make.”

Fardeen Khan responds to Zeenat Aman’s claims about his father Feroz Khan docking her payment: ‘Family wasn’t spared either’,Zeenat Aman recently shared memories about working with Feroz Khan. His son Fardeen Khan has now reacted to the Instagram post.,"Days after “Queen” Zeenat Aman shared memories about working with Feroz Khan, and revealed that the actor-director had once docked her payment for being late to set, Feroz’s son Fardeen Khan has now reacted to her claims, which she’d shared in an Instagram post.
Taking to the platform on Thursday, Zeenat shared a picture with Feroz, praising the actor and noting that he was the only person she knew who had “rizz”.

In the same post, Zeenat shared a story about being late to the film’s set after partying all night. Feroz, displeased with her tardiness, cut her pay. Despite this incident, she described Feroz as a cool and talented individual, and said that working on Qurbani remains one of her favourite professional experiences.

"Salaar box office collection day 15: Prabhas’ film plummets further, will struggle to cross Rs 400 crore domestically, Rs 700 crore worldwide","Salaar box office collection day 15: The Prabhas-starrer's current India nett collections are significantly lower than those of Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan and Pathaan, Ranbir Kapoor's Animal, Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 and Rajinikanth's Jailer.","As the Sankranti/Pongal weekend approaches, bringing with it a lineup of highly-anticipated big-budget films, it appears that director Prashanth Neel’s Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is unlikely to surpass the box office collection of Siddharth Anand’s Pathaan, let alone Atlee Kumar’s Jawan and Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, based on current trends.
Although the Prabhas-starrer had a strong start and outperformed the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan (Rs 75 crore) as the biggest opener of 2023, earning over Rs 90 crore on day one, the film has been witnessing a massive decline in its daily box office earnings.

As per industry tracking website Sacnilk, Dunki’s box office on Friday (January 5) was Rs 2.20 crore, taking its total India nett earnings to Rs 208.67 crore. According to the film’s production house, Red Chillies Entertainment, director Rajkumar Hirani’s has earned Rs 422.99 crore at the global box office, which means that it will overtake Chennai Express’ Rs 423 crore lifetime gross today to become the third-biggest hit of SRK’s career behind Jawan and Pathaan. Incidentally, each of these films was released in 2023.
Also starring Taapsee Pannu and Vikcy Kaushal, Dunki is holding well at the box office, but it hasn’t been able to match the lifetime box office performance of Hirani’s earlier films, like the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Sanju, which made Rs Rs 588 crore worldwide during its theatrical run in 2017, and Aamir Khan’s PK (2014) whose total gross was Rs 769.89 crore.

AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam: Bringing out the best in each other since 1992,"AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam have bestowed Indian cinema with some of the greatest tracks with extraordinary visuals. The two have mutually enhanced each other's brilliance, extracting the best from their collaboration.","An ever-romantic Aravind Swamy singing his heart out for his love; a charismatic Mohanlal and Aishwarya Rai dancing in the rain, exposing the government’s inefficiency; a heartthrob Shah Rukh Khan grooving atop a moving train, rendering one of the most influential Hindi songs ever; a charming Madhavan and Shalini setting couple goals; a devoted father and mother expressing love for their daughter, enumerating her significance to them; a mesmerising Aishwarya Rai savouring the rains in the lush green landscapes of rural India; a Raavan realising the true glory of Sita; a modern couple reflects on love in today’s context while traversing familiar surroundings; and a track mapping the thoughts of a Chola commander.
These are just a few songs that AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam have created in the past 32 years since the two began joining forces. This list doesn’t even have one song each from all their movies, let alone their entire discography. Yet, just the aforementioned songs show that the impact of music composer AR Rahman, celebrating his 56th birthday this Saturday, and filmmaker Mani Ratnam on Indian cinema is unparalleled. They have bestowed the visual art with some of the greatest tracks with extraordinary visuals, mutually enhancing each other’s brilliance, extracting the best from their collaboration, and ensuring the enduring timelessness of their songs and movies.

Three of Us: Shefali Shah and Jaideep Ahlawat’s film is an art of relinquishing and preserving a treasured past,Avinash Arun Dhaware's Three of Us is about returning to one's beginning — a journey not solely rooted in nostalgia but a deliberate effort to reclaim the fragments of ourselves we may have intentionally left behind.,"We are often told not to think about our past, fearing it might hold us back. After all, living in hindsight is always rosier than dealing with the present. The past has always been a source of misery as well as comfort for me. But some life events – broken friendships, the inevitable challenges of aging parents, and the overarching responsibilities of relationships – compelled me to reassess the present.
After years of consciously sidestepping my past, I unexpectedly found a mirror of my experience in Shailaja Desai, a character brought to life by Shefali Shah in Avinash Arun Dhaware’s Three of Us. Shailaja, a woman teetering on the edge of dementia, visits the small town of her childhood years, and the friends she had fought hard to forget during her bustling life in Mumbai.

Mammooty’s Kaathal-The Core throws light on the lives of gay men who disappear,"Queer people will tell you about hundreds of Mathews they meet in their lives. Men (and women) who disappear from queer circles, and then you come across their wedding pictures on social media sites.","A crucial scene from Jeo Baby’s brilliant Kaathal-The Core reminded me of a man I interviewed a decade back. In the scene, Mathew (a brilliant Mammooty), a middle-aged married man fighting a divorce case, takes the stand. His wife, Omana (Jyothika), has declared in her petition that he is gay and has subjected her to mental “cruelty”. He is asked by the opposition lawyer if he thinks being gay is a natural thing, he answers in affirmative. She then asks him if he is gay, his answer is a swift “no”.
The story I reported was about gay men who choose to get married to women, without coming out to them. After a doctor of Delhi’s AIIMS died by suicide, stating in her suicide note that she had discovered that her husband was gay, we interviewed gay men across the country, on condition of anonymity, of course. I met one such man in a Kolkata bar. Much like Mathew, he was fighting a particularly messy divorce battle with a woman he had been married to for a few years. His wife wanted divorce on similar grounds, she accused him of cruelty. He talked about growing up being attracted to women, he talked about his many relationships with other men, but he kept insisting that his (then) wife was lying about him. That he can be married to his wife, though he is only attracted to men. As journalists, we are trained to not judge our subjects, but I hated that man then. He made me feel ashamed of being a gay man. It’s so easy to be ashamed of oneself when you live on the fringes.

As evolutionary biology professor Paul Mathews (Cage) keeps telling his university students, we are all wrong when we see the African equine’s black and white stripes as a way of camouflage. Rather, the zebra’s strength lies in blending in, into a herd, thus confusing the predator that can’t tell one from the other.

"Society of the Snow movie review: Harrowing yet hopeful, Netflix’s Oscar contender isn’t for the faint-hearted","Society of the Snow movie review: Sensitively directed by JA Bayona, Netflix's epic survival drama adds a human touch to a harrowing true story.","Director JA Bayona’s horror sensibilities often get the better of him, regardless of whether he’s making a sombre drama or one of the most expensive films in history. Fresh off the success of his Spanish-language thriller The Orphanage, Bayona couldn’t help but ramp up the scares in The Impossible, the weepy that he directed about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Nor could he resist inserting a scene straight out of gothic horror in the otherwise forgettable Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. But neither killer waves nor giant dinosaurs are scarier than the true story that he has decided to dramatise in his latest film, Spain’s official entry to this year’s Oscars, Society of the Snow.
Released on Netflix as a part of the streamer’s leaner-than-usual awards season slate, the epic survival drama revisits the famous 1972 Andes flight disaster, which left around two dozen Uruguayans — mostly young men — stranded at the top of a snow-clad mountain. Rescue efforts were called off after a week or so, after search planes flew over the survivors more than once, but cruelly failed to spot them because the wreckage had blended in with the snow.

Yatra 2 teaser: Jiiva plays CM Y S Jaganmohan Reddy in story about the inception of YSR Congress Party,"While Yatra, the first part of the biography, was a human drama, director Mahi V Raghav comes across as a bit over-the-top film with politicians coming across as villains.","The inception of the YSR Congress started a new chapter not just in Andhra Pradesh, but the whole of India. The success of the party reinforced the idea of federalism, that has been a core tenet of the country. Yatra 2, directed by Mahi V Raghav and starring Jiiva, is all about the origin of the party and the struggles Jaganmohan Reddy faced in bringing in changing the political landscape of the state.
The teaser reveals that unlike the first part, which was a sober human drama, Yatra 2 will be more over-the-top with respect to the political feud that ensued between the Congress party and Jaganmohan Reddy after the death of YS Rajasekhara Reddy.

"‘AR Rahman’s surroundings have divine energy, asked me to wear a cap and perform wazu before Kun Faya Kun’: Javed Ali",AR Rahman created a divine atmosphere before he recorded Rockstar's 'Kun Faya Kun' with Javed Ali.,"AR Rahman’s composition of Rockstar’s ‘Kun Faya Kun’ is considered one of his finest compositions and in a recent interview, singer Javed Ali opened up about the recording of the song and compared the experience of recording this song to praying. Filmed on Ranbir Kapoor, the song was written by Irshad Kamil and carried the vocals of Javed, Rahman, Mohit Chauhan and Nizami Brothers.
Javed, in a chat with The Music Podcast, shared that he was ready to record the song just like any other song but Rahman then made him feel like this was a prayer. “I remember I was singing ‘Kun Faya Kun’ and I was just standing there, ready to record. He asked have you done ‘wazu’? He said please do that first, so I did that sincerely. Even after doing ‘wazu’, I put on a cap and that’s when I recorded the song,” he recalled.

"Golden Globes: Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett will present awards. Here’s what to know","Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories.","Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried will be among the presenters at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards. The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.
Others taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).
Check out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list
Wednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.
ADVERTISEMENT
How can I watch the Golden Globes?
Viewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.

What’s new with the Golden Globes?
The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.
Who’s hosting the Globes?
Comedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.

What about 60 Minutes?
The Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.
Golden Globe nominees
Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.

What are the Globes known for?
The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.

Some years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.

Shark Tank’s Vineeta Singh highlights ‘real problem’ with Animal: ‘Extremely toxic character is allowed to get away with it’,"In an interview, Shark Tank's Vineeta Singh spoke about her biggest quibble with Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Kabir Singh and Animal.","Shark Tank’s Vineeta Singh added her two cents about the controversial film Animal, and said that while she generally supports the exploration of dark themes in cinema, she felt that the film’s protagonist wasn’t adequately punished for his bad behaviour. In a new interview, she said that she had similar feelings about the film Kabir Singh, also directed by Animal’s Sandeep Reddy Vanga.
Vineeta, the CEO of Sugar Cosmetics, became a household name after appearing on the first season of Shark Tank India. On Ranveer Allahbadia’s podcast recently, she was asked about Animal, and she said, “I broadly agree that art is art, and when a fictional character is created, regardless of whether he’s played by Ranbir Kapoor or Shakti Kapoor, he’s still a fictional character. Hollywood makes such films regularly, look at Quentin Tarantino’s films. I was arguing with my friends about Kabir Singh and Animal… The only thing I agree with is this: in India, we’ve seen for so many years, bad guys lose in the end; they get what they deserve. The good guy always wins.”

"Janhvi Kapoor quotes disgraced actor Kevin Spacey on shielding your true self, Reddit says, ‘Inappropriate choice of quote and person’","Audiences have noticed Janhvi Kapoor quoting disgraced actor Kevin Spacey in a recent interview, and are wondering why she chose to do it.","In a recent interview, actor Janhvi Kapoor quoted the disgraced actor Kevin Spacey while making a point about social media exposure. She said that she’d prefer to keep certain sides to her personality hidden from the public, because one’s social media persona can often influence how they’re perceived by the audience. Janhvi said that she isn’t ‘equipped’ to calculate how to use social media to her advantage, as she quoted Spacey.
The Hollywood actor, once regarded as among the finest of his generation, was accused by several people of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement in 2017. Netflix severed ties with him, removing him from the final season of House of Cards, while director Ridley Scott replaced him in his film All the Money in the World. Last year, Spacey was acquitted of sexual assault charges by a jury in London. Spacey has denied the charges, but his career has been severely impacted by them.

"Glynis Johns, Mary Poppins star who first sang Sondheim’s ‘Send in the Clowns’, dies at 100",Glynis Johns' manager said she died Thursday at an assisted living home in Los Angeles of natural causes.,"Glynis Johns, a Tony Award-winning stage and screen star who played the mother opposite Julie Andrews in the classic movie Mary Poppins and introduced the world to the bittersweet standard-to-be “Send in the Clowns” by Stephen Sondheim, has died. She was 100.
Mitch Clem, her manager, said she died Thursday at an assisted living home in Los Angeles of natural causes. “Today’s a sad day for Hollywood,” Clem said. “She is the last of the last of old Hollywood.” Johns was known to be a perfectionist about her profession — precise, analytical and opinionated. The roles she took had to be multi-faceted. Anything less was giving less than her all.

“As far as I’m concerned, I’m not interested in playing the role on only one level,” she told The Associated Press in 1990. “The whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real.” Johns’ greatest triumph was playing Desiree Armfeldt in A Little Night Music, for which she won a Tony in 1973. Sondheim wrote the show’s hit song “Send in the Clowns” to suit her distinctive husky voice, but she lost the part in the 1977 film version to Elizabeth Taylor.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I’ve had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,” Johns told the AP in 1990. “It’s the greatest gift I’ve ever been given in the theatre.” Others who followed Johns in singing Sondheim’s most popular song include Frank Sinatra, Judy Collins, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan and Olivia Newton-John. It also appeared in season two of “Yellowjackets” in 2023, sung by Elijah Wood.
Back when it was being conceived, “A Little Night Music” had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas.
“Hal said Why don’t you just say what you feel,” she recalled to the AP. “When Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve Sondheim and said, I think you’d better get in a cab and get round here and watch what they’re doing because you are going to get the idea for Glynis’ solo.” Johns was the fourth generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn Johns, had a long career as a character actor and her mother was a pianist. She was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were visiting the area on tour at the time of her birth.
Johns was a dancer at 12 and an actor at 14 in London’s West End. Her breakthrough role was as the amorous mermaid in the title of the 1948 hit comedy Miranda.

“I was quite an athlete, my muscles were strong from dancing, so the tail was just fine; I swam like a porpoise,” she told Newsday in 1998. In 1960’s The Sundowners, with Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar. (She lost out to Shirley Jones in Elmer Gantry).
Other highlights include playing the mother in Mary Poppins, the movie that introduced Julie Andrews and where she sang the rousing tune “Sister Suffragette”. She also starred in the 1989 Broadway revival of The Circle, W Somerset Maugham’s romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, opposite Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger.
“I’ve retired many times. My personal life has come before my work. The theatre is just part of my life. It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that I’ve got the talent. I’m not as good doing anything else,” she told the AP.
To prepare for A Coffin in Egypt, Horton Foote’s 1998 play about a grand dame reminiscing about her life on and off a ranch on the Texas prairie, she asked the Texas-born Foote to record a short tape of himself reading some lines and used it as her coach.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a 1991 revival of A Little Night Music in Los Angeles, she played Madame Armfeldt, the mother of Desiree, the part she had created. In 1963, she starred in her own TV sitcom “Glynis”.
Johns lived all around the world and had four husbands. The first was the father of her only child, the late Gareth Forwood, an actor who died in 2007.

"Harry Johnson, who starred in Harry & Louise, dies at 81","Born in 1942, Plainfield, Harry Johnson was known as Chip Johnson in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of Universal Studios' final contract performers.","Harry Johnson, an actor with credits ranging from the original Battlestar Galactica to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, various Dick Wolf programmes, and the famed Harry & Louise ads, died on January 2 in Los Angeles after a protracted illness, Deadline reported. He was 81. Christiane, his wife, confirmed his death to Deadline.
Born on December 27, 1942, in Plainfield, New Jersey, he was known as Chip Johnson in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of Universal Studios’ final contract performers.
Johnson began his screen career with the multi-part pilot episode of Battlestar Galactica in 1978 and went on to guest-star on dozens of TV series, including M*A*S*H, Quincy M.E., The Incredible Hulk, Simon & Simon, The Greatest American Hero, Highway to Heaven, The A-Team, Who’s the Boss?, Thirtysomething, Melrose Place, Party of Five, Days of Our Lives and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He was a prominent ADR voice actor who has contributed to several Need for Speed video games. For more than two decades, Johnson was the voice-over or looping group on several Dick Wolf episodes, including all of the Law & Order and Chicago series.
ADVERTISEMENT
He also acted in films such as Real Genius, Warlock, and The Spitfire Grill, as well as various TV films, most notably Time Warp, in which he co-starred with Batman veteran Adam West.
Johnson famously played Harry in a series of Harry & Louise TV and radio commercials against President Bill Clinton’s health-care proposal in 1993-94.
The Health Insurance Association of America funded the advertising, which was so popular (one famous slogan was ‘If you let the government choose, we lose’) that the Democratic National Committee later produced response ads. In 2000 and 2004, Johnson and Louise Claire Clark reprised their roles in election-year ads.
Harry and Louise reappeared in an ad that aired at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and again the following year, this time for a commercial promoting President Barack Obama’s new health-care proposal.
ADVERTISEMENT
The commercials were imitated during the 2006 Oscars broadcast, featuring a voiceover by Stephen Colbert, then-host of The Colbert Report.
Johnson went on to write books under the pen name Harry Castle. His debut novel, Fugitive Romance, the Fictional Memoir of a Hollywood Screenwriter, was published in 2013, while his second book, Miracles & Misfits, was a collection of short stories.
Johnson’s wife told Deadline that he loved to sail and was well-known among coworkers for his humour and habit of bringing a lightness to settings, making work enjoyable.
Johnson is survived by his stepchildren Oliver and Penelope, as well as his wife of 15 years, Christiane.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/harry-johnson-who-starred-in-harry-and-louise-dies-9096125/,entertainment

"Bobby Deol exits Mumbai airport without security, gets mobbed by adoring fans: ‘Deserves this’. Watch ",Bobby Deol was mobbed by fans who wanted to get a selfie at Mumbai airport. The actor has been appreciated for his work in Animal.,"Bobby Deol has had many comebacks in the last few years but none of those worked quite like Animal. In Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film, Bobby played a small role that appeared on the screen for less than 15 minutes but left enough impact that the audience could not stop talking about him after the film. In his many interviews shortly after the release of the film, the actor spoke about his long wait for recognition and how this phase of his career has given him a lot more than he could have expected. Now, it seems like the reactions of Bobby’s fame aren’t just virtual.
Recently, when Bobby was trying to exit the Mumbai airport without any security, he was mobbed by fans who wanted to get a selfie with him. Bobby could not stop smiling as he was loving the attention.

"Dunki box office collection day 15: Shah Rukh Khan film earns Rs 417 cr, still to catch up with 3 Idiots","Dunki box office collection day 15: Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki earned Rs 2.65 crore on its second Thursday, which is its lowest collection so far.","Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki has been in the theatres for a little over two weeks. The film’s box office collections have been stuck in single digit numbers for almost all of its second week, the numbers declined further on Thursday. On its 15th day in the cinemas, Dunki made Rs 2.65 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk, taking its domestic nett collections to Rs 206.53 crore.
Dunki’s global box office collection stands at Rs 417.1 crore, as per the film’s producers Red Chillies Entertainment. Dunki released with Salaar which dominated the box office. While it does not have much competition at the theatres for the next couple of weeks, it seems rather difficult for the film to cross the Rs 500 crore mark.

Salaar box office collection day 14: Prabhas now responsible for three of Telugu cinema’s four biggest ever hits; can Prashanth Neel’s blockbuster touch Rs 700 cr?,Salaar box office collection day 14: Prabhas' comeback film stands an outside chance of passing the Rs 700 crore worldwide. It is already the 12th biggest Indian film of all time.,"The Prabhas-starrer Salaar continued its downward trajectory at the box office on its 14th day of release. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the action-thriller made an estimated Rs 4.5 crore on Thursday, and this takes its total domestic collections to Rs 378 crore. The film still has a strong chance of passing the Rs 400 crore mark domestically, although it has been highly front-loaded.
Salaar opened to Rs 90 crore on day one, and made over Rs 300 crore in its first week alone. But despite the less-than-encouraging trajectory that the film has shown – drops like this are emblematic of poor audience response – the film has emerged as Prabhas’ biggest hit since Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, and the third-biggest Telugu-language movie of all time. Prabhas can now boast about having led three of the top four films on this list, although Salaar has grossed roughly half of what Baahubali 2 did worldwide. The only outlier is RRR, starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR.

"In the year of Shah Rukh Khan’s domination, how Orry, Shehnaaz Gill, Uorfi Javed and Elvish Yadav became new-age newsmakers","The birth of new age celebrities--Shehnaaz Gill, Uorfi Javed, Elvish Yadav and Orry--and what it means for stardom as we know it.","How to become a celebrity? Imagine a high-end supermarket, where the top-shelf shiny item is the movie celebrity-starter pack. People can access it, but not everyone is able to use it. Its ingredients are simple, but not easy achievable– popularity that cuts across gender, region and age, box office numbers to flex, cultural impact for its time and, of course, legacy. In 2023, the ingredient of the starter pack perhaps has undergone a slight change; it now includes–but isn’t limited to–social media following. Does it still taste well?
From Bollywood’s point of view, 2023 will be earmarked as the triumphant return of Shah Rukh Khan. His films smashed records, made fans sing and dance, created a stir and continued to win new audience. But away from the shadow of the offline mega stardom on display, birthed, lived and became stronger a new breed of stars– the online kind.

"Controversies, judgements and publicly discussed private life: Deepika Padukone’s art of living involves quietly swimming against the tide","What differentiates Deepika Padukone from her contemporaries is that she has been relentlessly subjected to attacks and threats, which have shaped, more than the actor that she is, the star that she has become.","There is an end credits sequence in Imtiaz Ali’s Tamasha, where Ranbir Kapoor’s Ved and Deepika Padukone’s Tara are back in Corsica, dancing alone, happily, with headphones plugged in. The world hears faint atmospheric sound, but they dance to a great AR Rahman music in their head. That’s pretty much how Deepika Padukone, one of the biggest female stars of the generation, has led her life off screen. Over a clearly soaring Bollywood career with major tumultuous phases, she has mastered one crucial art: Of remaining quiet and turning all the noise around her into musical notes. The actor, who celebrates her 38th birthday on Friday, has always been dancing her way.
Only a few female stars, who made their debut in the last decade or so, have been able to stamp their identity so strongly in public conscience the way Deepika Padukone has. And it isn’t even about her movie catalogue anymore, which anyway oscillates between big blockbusters, projects with prestige directors and a few charming mid-sized projects. Deepika Padukone in 2023 stands as the sum total of not only how the audience has reacted to her through the years but also how she has handled those reactions.

Before he made 3 Idiots, Hirani was to direct the third part of the Munnabhai series, which even had a title and a teaser but he did not go ahead with it.
Asked whether the third installment is still a possibility, Hirani said it has been on his mind for a while now but he does not want to direct it without a great story and just to capitalise on the popularity of his first two movies, Munnabhai MBBS in 2003 and Lage Raho Munnabhai in 2006, starring Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi as an affable goon and his sidekick.
“It’s not that I don’t want to do it, 100 per cent I want to do it because I had fun making those films. After every film, I’ve tried to write one Munnabhai. So, I’ve five unfinished Munna Bhai scripts lying with me with various titles such as Munna Bhai Chale America, Munna Bhai BA LLB, and Munna Bhai Chal Basse.
“There are many scripts written but none of them reached that level of greatness. I know that any Munnabhai that I make will make a huge amount of money now. But I don’t want to make it for that reason,” Hirani said.

The filmmaker said he has a lot of gratitude because his first film continues to be in the public consciousness 20 years after its release.

“I just feel gratitude towards life because nobody thought that films that were made 20 years ago would still be talked about, the lingo, the dialogues will still be in the psyche of this generation and you will still see memes,” Hirani said.
“I shot an ad with Sanju and Arshad recently where they are playing Munna and Circuit, and an ad film is made on a film that’s 20 years old with these characters. The reason I did that ad was to work with them. It’s genuinely fun to be working with Arshad and Sanju on the sets, and I hope I can do it someday (again),” said the director.

Captain Miller censor certificate hints at a violent Dhanush film,Central Board of Film Certification has suggested several changes to Dhanush's Captain Miller.,"As expected Dhanush‘s Captain Miller seems to be a violent film. Director Arun Matheshwaran’s films are known for the aesthetic portrayal of violence and looks like we will get to see the same in the upcoming Pongal release. The censor board certificate details of the movie, which is currently viral among Dhanush fans, hint that the film is high on violence and expletives.
The censor board has asked the makers to make several changes to the scenes and dialogues. CBFC has asked the makers to remove all the demeaning words about white people and the British. Words like Vellakaraga naaigal (White dogs) and white pigs have been asked to be muted. Other Tamil expletives have also faced cuts.

While some hail it as creative, others call it unorganised. Singer Alka Yagnik’s first experience of working with him started with her waiting for him for several hours but ended with feeling satisfied with the musical procedure. Now, she understands why the Oscar-winning music composer prefers working at odd hours.
In an interview with O2 India, Alka recalls working with Rahman for Taal when she and director Subhash Ghai waited for almost five hours for the music maestro to turn up. She said that initially, she did feel impatient.

When Gauri Khan broke up with ‘over-possessive’ Shah Rukh Khan: ‘My family was yet to reconcile to the fact that he was Muslim…’,There was a time when Gauri Khan decided to break up with Shah Rukh Khan because her family was against the relationship and he was growing over-possessive about her.,"The one man who has taught an entire generation how to romance had a rather dramatic love story in real life. It’s Shah Rukh Khan’s love story with his wife of over three decades, Gauri Khan. The two had a whirlwind romance before their marriage in 1991. They faced opposition from Gauri’s parents because of him being a Muslim. All the drama at home around her relationship with Shah Rukh made Gauri take a break from it.
In a 1994 interview with Filmfare, Gauri had shared why she broke up with Shah Rukh. “Oh, that was at the beginning when my family had yet to reconcile themselves to the fact that he’s a Muslim. I didn’t want to hurt my family, so I decided to break up with Shah Rukh,” shared the interior designer and film producer.

"Janhvi Kapoor admits she put all her eggs in the Bawaal basket, was gutted when the film went to OTT: ‘I wanted the numbers’","Janhvi Kapoor spoke about the backlash that Nitesh Tiwari's Bawaal received, and said that she didn't see it coming.","Actor Janhvi Kapoor spoke about the poor reviews that her last film, Bawaal, received when it was released on Prime Video in 2023. She said that she didn’t see it coming, because she’d become accustomed to the pure intentions that director Nitesh Tiwari was making the movie with. In a new interview, Janhvi admitted that she’d put all her eggs in one basket, and was hoping that Bawaal would take things to the next level for her.
In an interview with Film Companion, Janhvi said that she fought to be a part of Bawaal, and then changed her dates around to ensure that she’s able to do the film. But the first setback came when she was told that the movie wouldn’t be releasing in theatres at all. Also starring Varun Dhawan, Bawaal followed the story of a mismatched small town couple, who go on a trip to Europe, and discover that their own problems pale in comparison to what the Jews experienced during the Holocaust. As expected, the movie drew criticism for framing a regular couple’s domestic problems against the backdrop of a mass genocide.

Abraham Ozler: Jayaram looks promising as a quintessential brooding investigator in this crime drama,"Directed by Midhun Manuel Thomas of Anjaam Pathiraa fame, Abraham Ozler is another crime drama with Jayaram in the lead role.","Director Midhun Manuel Thomas is back to his grind with Abraham Ozler. The trailer of the film introduces you to a brooding titular character who seems to be guilt-ridden. We learn he keeps bringing food to a culprit in a prison. Though the reason behind the gesture is unknown, it hints at a dark past to Ozler, who is currently an insomniac and is on the edge. In one instance, he says there is no place even in hell for people like him. And then comes an unsolvable case. Will it absolve him of his past sins or will it awaken the suppressed trauma?
Looks like Midhun’s upcoming film travels the familiar landscape of such crime dramas, but it is intriguing to see Jayaram in such a role, who seems to be pretty comfortable in it. Largely known for his comic sense, Jayaram aces this dark territory too.

"First Pooh, now Mickey. In public domain, early Mickey Mouse version will star in horror movies","In the trailer for Mickey’s Mouse Trap, directed by Jamie Bailey, what appears to be a human in a comically small Mickey mask terrorizes a group of young people at an arcade.","Slashed free of Disney’s copyright as of Monday, the iconic character from Steamboat Willie is already the focus of two horror films. On Monday, just hours after the 1928 short entered the public domain, a trailer for Mickey’s Mouse Trap dropped on YouTube. Another yet-to-be-titled film was announced Tuesday.
Steamboat Willie featured early versions of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, it was the third cartoon featuring the duo they made but the first to be released. In it, a more menacing Mickey, bearing more resemblance to rat than mouse, captains a boat and makes musical instruments out of other animals.
It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the first projects announced are seemingly low-budget and campy slasher movies — and not unprecedented. Winnie the Pooh — sans red shirt — entered the public domain in 2022; scarcely a year later, he was notching up a heavy body count in the microbudget Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.

In the trailer for Mickey’s Mouse Trap, directed by Jamie Bailey, what appears to be a human in a comically small Mickey mask terrorizes a group of young people at an arcade.
“A place for fun. A place for friends. A place for hunting,” text flashed during the trailer reads. The mouse is out.
“We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it’s Steamboat Willie’s Mickey Mouse murdering people,” director Jamie Bailey said in a statement cited by trade publications. “It’s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.”
No release date has been set.
The second movie is from director Steven LaMorte, who previously directed a horror parody of The Grinch, which is not in the public domain (the movie is thus called The Mean One).
ADVERTISEMENT
“A late-night boat ride turns into a desperate fight for survival in New York City when a mischievous mouse becomes a monstrous reality,” is the logline for the untitled film, per a post on LaMorte’s Instagram.
“Steamboat Willie has brought joy to generations, but beneath that cheerful exterior lies a potential for pure, unhinged terror,” LaMorte said in a release cited by the trades. The movie has yet to begin production.
With the expiration of the 95-year copyright, the public is allowed to use only the initial versions of Mickey and Minnie — not the more familiar character designs.
“We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,” Disney said in a statement ahead of the characters entering the public domain.
ADVERTISEMENT
LaMorte told Variety that the producers of his film are working with a legal team so as not to run afoul of Disney, and will call their raging rodent Steamboat Willie instead of Mickey Mouse.
“We are doing our due diligence to make sure there’s no question or confusion of what we’re up to,” he said.

Dave Chappelle The Dreamer review: Controversial comedian promises to ‘keep punching down’ in mean-spirited Netflix standup special,"Dave Chappelle The Dreamer review: Like a theoretical physicist helping the Nazis during World War II, or a surgeon dedicating his life to stealing kidneys, the legendary comedian isn’t exactly putting his skills to good use.","Dave Chappelle opens his latest Netflix special, The Dreamer, with a masterfully constructed joke, combining his penchant for autobiographical storytelling with his trademark laid-back delivery. It’s a pity, then, that he unleashes it in the service of a truly despicable punchline directed at, you guessed it, trans people. In a world populated by plenty of real villains — racists, corrupt politicians, warmongers — Chappelle has decided, for some obscure reason, to make the queer community his enemy. And it’s truly tragic to watch one of the greatest comics of all time devote his talent to pettiness that would be viewed with pity even on a school playground.
In fact, watching him perform in recent years can immediately transform you into a middle-aged Indian schoolteacher. “This boy had so much potential,” you think to yourself, as you shake your head in regret. But like a theoretical physicist helping the Nazis during World War II or a surgeon dedicating his life to stealing kidneys, Chappelle isn’t exactly putting his skills to good use. And to top it all, he just can’t seem to stop viewing himself as the wronged party in all of this.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/dave-chappelle-the-dreamer-review-mean-spirited-netflix-standup-special-9091652/,entertainment
In defence of Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki: An effective testimony of sufferings of many,"In Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, goodness of the common Indian propels the story forward. In a way, it's a Hirani construct -- the unflinching faith (rather hope) in humanity that once defined films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee.","Days before the release of Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki, The Indian Express visited Gholpura village in Haryana-Punjab border, where every house has a member settled abroad. And most of them have taken the Dunki (or the illegal) route to Canada, US and England. One thing that most interviewees mentioned is how this perilous journey, which passes through some of the most hostile terrains in the world, wouldn’t have been possible without the kindness of fellow travellers. Men and women from different walks of life, who would share their bread with fellow Indians, ensure that no one gets left behind.
In Hirani’s ‘Dunki’, goodness of the common Indian propels the story forward. In a way, it’s a Hirani construct — the unflinching faith (rather hope) in humanity that once defined films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Hirani, in the way only he can, throws light on the lives of a few Dunki travellers who migrate to London from Punjab. What follows is a rags-to-not-rags story, as Manu (Taapsee Pannu), a feisty girl from a Punjab village, travels illegally to England, walking through perilous jungles, dodging bullets of border police, escaping rape and persecution, with a little help from the adoring Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan), her ‘banda’ (boyfriend). Embedded within it, however, is a story of red tape (and corruption) that surrounds every effort of these helpless men and women who want to access a better life in countries that will anyway use them for work that none of their citizens want to do. Manu and her friends find their way through the dehumanising labyrinth of forms, oral tests, fake marriages and cons, until a combination of persistence and Shah Rukh Khan, take them back to where it all started, the Punjab village, where the mustard field is always swaying to Pritam’s melodies and lassi flows endlessly from jugs. The very structure of ‘Dunki’, and indeed almost all of Hirani’s films, means it will always have the propensity to drift into melodrama, and plays with the kind of cliches that will pull at your heartstrings. But it almost always comes back to a more pointed center because of another quintessential Hirani ingredient — humour.

"Salaar and Vardha are amplified versions of Thalapathi’s Devaraj and Surya — but high on testosterone, with low EQ","The characters Deva and Vardha in Salaar are merely amplified versions of Surya and Devaraj from Thalapathi, ruling over the larger and more affluent kingdom of Khansaar, while being consistently high on testosterone, but with low EQ.","A strong man whom the people regard as their ruler due to his righteousness faces numerous obstacles in his path; seeking solace and assistance, he turns to his best friend, a formidable figure known for strength, dominance and virtue; the latter assumes the role of commander, and together, they lead their army against the ruler’s rivals who are determined to dethrone and eliminate him; the unbreakable bond between the ruler and his commander proves insurmountable, with their deep love for each other serving as their most powerful weapon.
If you’ve watched both Mani Ratnam’s Thalapathi and Prashanth Neel’s Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire, a retelling of Neel’s 2014 film Ugramm, you may be uncertain about which movie is being discussed here. Don’t worry; it’s not your fault if you can’t identify the film. In fact, from its core to the surface, Salaar is essentially a revamped version of the 1991 gangster film, which itself draws inspiration from the purported friendship between Karna and Duryodhana, characters from the Hindu epic Mahabharata.

"This actress was the star of India’s first ever sequel made in 1940s, did her own action decades before Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn ","This week that year: On Fearless Nadia's 116th birth anniversary, here's looking back at the original franchise queen who starred in India's first sequel.","Sequels and franchises are the lifeblood of the movie business today. Most films are either a part of a franchise or could possibly get included in a ‘cinematic universe’ if they are successful. Even those films, that could be independent stories, leave enough room for a sequel, and while you might think that this is a new phenomenon for Indian films or something that we stole from our Western counterparts, the origin for franchises in India goes back to the 1940s. And much like today, this became a sure-shot way for a film’s success as soon as it was introduced. The first film to have a sequel was the 1935 film Hunterwali, starring the original stunt queen Fearless Nadia and the sequel, which came almost a decade later, revived her career.
In the 1930s, filmmaker Homi Wadia made a series of films which were heavily reliant on stunts and unlike now, the actors playing the lead roles were responsible for doing the action scenes themselves. Nadia, who earned the moniker ‘Fearless’ and had performed stunts with lions in a closed cage, was the star of most of these films. In an interview with Girish Karnad in 1980, Homi had shared that the best era for stunt films was from 1935-1940. Mythological and historical films drew a lot of crowds in this era and when the audience was presented with action films where all the stunts were performed by an actress of Australian descent, they were hooked. Nadia, who was born as Mary, had moved to India with her parents during the First World War. And during the 1930s, she got established as the actress who could pull off any imaginable stunt. Her anglisiced Hindi attracted the viewers and her abandon towards performing the role of a warrior, while also managing to seduce her audience with her acting, gave her a unique position in the movies. The other Indian female actors were known for their demure and delicate ways but Nadia got love from the audience for being the exact opposite.

"Vetrimaaran: ‘If you are not taking a stand, it means you are standing by the oppressor’",Filmmaker Vetrimaaran in a roundtable spoke about recent Tamil films and the social justice movement that they have brought about.,"Director Vetrimaaran has lately been making films about oppression. Be it Asuran, a bloody tale of a socially backward farmer, or his latest film, Viduthalai Part 1, an anti-establishment film about the violence meted out by police in tribal villages, the director has been making powerful statements with his movies. Speaking about the same, Vetrimaaran, at the roundtable of Cinema Express, credited director Pa Ranjith for the movement. He also shared his thoughts on social justice, and how an individual shouldn’t shy away from standing up for the oppressed.
When asked what’s his view about people who can afford not to take a stand when it comes to issues that films like Viduthalai and Maamannan deal with, Vetrimaaran said, “Imagine a couple is fighting on the road. And the man is beating the woman. If you just pass by without interfering because it is their issue, you are supporting the man. There is no one called a by-stander. If you are not taking a stand when it comes to the issue of oppression, it means you are standing by the oppressor.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/vetrimaaran-if-you-are-not-taking-a-stand-it-means-you-are-standing-by-the-oppressor-9092437/,entertainment

When Yash Johar joked about the expenses on Amitabh Bachchan’s Agneepath: ‘Meri pitayi kar rahe hain’,Yash Johar joked about the expenses on the set of Amitabh Bachchan starrer-Agneepath. The film flopped at box office but has found cult status since.,"When Yash Johar’s Dharma Productions produced the 1990 film Agneepath with Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role, the actor and the producer were both desperate for a hit. Yash Johar had been around in the film industry for a few decades by then and even his film production company had been around for almost a decade but they were yet to experience a big hit. But, despite all of that, Yash Johar had a jovial attitude and his sense of humour could always make people laugh.
In a recent interview with Rajshri Unplugged, actor Rohini Hattangadi recalled the time when she was working in Agneepath and producer Yash Johar took a dig at himself. Rohini recalled that in the process of trying to age a prop on the set, one of the crew members was hitting the prop with a stick and as they continued to do it, the prop looked a little older and shabby, as the scene demanded. During the process, a child actor asked Yash why this was being done and Yash, in his own style, answered, “Bete, yeh meri pitayi kar rahe hain (It feels like they are hitting me).” Yash joked that the crew had first painted the prop and had then aged it so as a producer, both things were adding up in his cost.

Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai glimpse: Nivin Pauly is in search of his love across centuries in Ram’s film,Nivin Pauly's character claims to be more than 8000 years old in Ram's directorial venture.,"Director Ram, best known for his debut film Katradhu Tamizh, is back with Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai which is reminiscent of his first movie. Here too an unkept but intriguing protagonist is in search of his lost love. However, unlike Katradhu Tamizh, which was a realistic tragedy, Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai comes across as a supernatural drama about a protagonist who is traversing across centuries to find his love.
Nivin Pauly is a vagabond in a tattered long coat, who seems to be more than what he comes across as. A fellow passenger (played by Soori), who reminds one of Karunas’ character from Katradhu Tamizh, is in disbelief when he hears that Nivin’s character has been living for 8822 years. It is up to the audience to decide whether the protagonist is sane or not. He also tells his love (played by Anjali) that when he first saw her, she was a queen.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/yezhu-kadal-yezhu-malai-glimpse-nivin-pauly-is-in-search-of-his-love-across-centuries-in-rams-film-9092215/,entertainment

"Ilaiyaraaja says Ponniyin Selvan films were not like the novel at all: ‘I am not finding faults with it, but…’","At the art exhibition of famed artist and illustrator Maniam, who is known for his works in Kalki's Ponniyin Selvan, music icon Ilaiyaraaja opined that he couldn't enjoy Ponniyin Selvan films as much as the novels.","Music maestro Ilaiyaraaja is known for speaking his mind without holding anything back. At times, it has led to severe backlash, but the veteran composer has never heeded any criticism. In a recent interview, on the sidelines of an art exhibition in Chennai, Raja expressed his thoughts about Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan films. It looks like the movies didn’t impress the legend, who claimed that the films didn’t give him the feel of the novel.
Ilaiyaraaja was one of the chief guests of late artist and illustrator Maniam’s art exhibition in Chennai. Maniam is widely known for his illustrations for Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan series, which was published as a series in Kalki magazine for about seven years. Speaking at the event, Ilaiyaraaja praised Maniam’s work and how he and his friends were in love with the world. “My friends including director Bharathiraja were huge fans of the books, and we used to take the book from a lending library nearby. We would only find the second part or the third part as the rest would be with someone else. Kalki’s words and his writings made me fly in my imagination. It was his and Maniam’s illustrations of Kundhavai and Vandhiyathevan that made me dream about the world. And it was not the films. It didn’t feel like the novel at all. Don’t think I am finding faults with it. I have been affected by the book that much. I don’t know how many times I have read the series.”

Geographically, I lived in a different part of the city and I was far removed from the nepo kids.

When Amitabh Bachchan was berated in front of 200 people for fumbling Urdu line: ‘Laanat hai… Harivansh Rai Bachchan ke bete ho tum’,"When Amitabh Bachchan was struggling with a line of Urdu in the film Kaalia, Tinnu Anand's father stepped in to direct the scene.","Actor Tinnu Anand, who also directed hit Amitabh Bachchan-starrers Kaalia and Shahenshah, recalled stories about working with the superstar. Looking back on the four years that it took to complete Kaalia, Tinnu narrated a story about his father, writer Inder Raj Anand, assuming control of the project for a scene that Amitabh was struggling with. The actor couldn’t get himself to correctly deliver a line in Urdu, leading Tinnu’s father to berate him in front of the entire crew.
Asked if he had any disagreements with the star, he said in an interview with News-18, “The disagreements were mainly about dialogue. My father was the strength of Urdu; no one could argue with him. He was nowhere around set, but there was a party scene, in which Pran saab says, ‘You’ve made a grand success of your life, but the road you’ve taken is made of gold, and that will lead you straight to my prison, or to the gallows. Kaalia, that is your future’. And Kaalia says, ‘Kya naza ki takleefon mein maza, jab maut na aaye jawaani mein. Kya lutf janaaza uthne ka, hargaam pe jab maatam na hoga‘. I told my father when he wrote the line, I said, ‘Dad, what does this mean?'”

I would have disappointed and messed up a lot of people’s lives if I passed. There’s a lot for me to fight for. Recovery is a one-way road in my mind. I still work hard every day,” he added.
Renner had suffered an accident in January 2023 after a snow plough ran him over as he was trying to save his nephew from getting run over himself. Renner broke over 30 bones in the accident, which required major rehabilitation.
Mayor of Kingstown follows the McLusky family, power brokers in Kingstown, Michigan, where the business of incarceration is the only thriving industry. In the Paramount+ series, Renner plays Mike McLusky, who acts as a liaison between criminals, prison guards, and police.

"Faysal Quraishi calls for release of Indian films in Pakistan: ‘If you have to run Pakistani cinemas, it’s important that you exhibit Indian films’","Faysal Quraishi said that if there was no ban on Indian films in Pakistan, the Pakistan film drama industry would have been earning around Rs 6,000 to 7,000 million annually.","Faysal Quraishi, one of Pakistan’s top actors and producers, has advocated for the release of Indian films in the country to revive the local cinema exhibition sector.
Quraishi, who has starred in several hit serials and also produced many blockbuster series, said Pakistan needed to lift the ban on screening of Indian films to survive and grow.
“Being a Pakistani, I’m very patriotic. But if you have to run Pakistani cinemas, it’s important that you exhibit Indian films. I’m being very selfish. But I know the audience in Pakistan wants to watch Indian films. You can’t enforce your will on them. Let us work to improve relations,” he said in an interview with a local channel.

There has been a complete ban on screening of Indian films in cinema houses in Pakistan since late 2019 but movie buffs can easily watch these movies on different streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which are legal and even others which are accessible through VPN services.

Faysal Quraishi
If there was no ban on Indian films in Pakistan, Faysal Quraishi said the Pakistan film industry would have been earning around Rs 6,000 to 7,000 million annually from the entertainment business, including screening of Pakistani content on Indian streaming portals and some channels.
“Our movies and serials were being shown on their online portals and people went to the cinemas as well to watch Indian films and it brought in valuable revenue for our industry. It is funny we tend to shut down our avenues of revenue,” he said.
Faysal Quraishi said he had come to the conclusion that until Indian films were allowed to be screened in Pakistani cinemas its industry could not grow.
ADVERTISEMENT
“People need new and exciting content to attract them to the cinemas and for that, not only do we need to improve our content and business models but also have no ban on screening of Indian movies. This would also reopen our content on streaming portals,” he added.
Quraishi said the Pakistan entertainment industry can be revived and it was necessary for Pakistani content to be shown on streaming portals.
“It is time we started producing content of such a level that we can even hit the international streaming platforms,” he said.

“You all know I’m passionate about fitness, but I’m even more passionate about staying fit the natural way. What I like more than fancy gyms is swimming, playing badminton, climbing stairs, exercising with ‘mudgar’, eating good healthy food…
“Change your lifestyle on the advice of doctors and not by looking at some film star’s body. Actors are often not what they appear on screen. Many types of filters and special effects are used and after seeing them, we start using shortcuts to change our body,” the actor said.
Akshay also cautioned the listeners about taking shortcuts in their fitness journey.

“Nowadays, many people take steroids and go for these six packs and eight packs. Friends, with such shortcuts the body swells from outside but remains hollow from inside. Remember that shortcuts can cut your life short. You need long-lasting fitness, not shortcuts…
“Like, I believe pure ghee, if eaten in the right quantity, is beneficial for us. But I see many boys and girls do not eat ghee because they fear they might become fat. It is very important for us to know what is good and what is bad for our fitness,” he added.
The actor likened fitness to “devotion”.

“It shouldn’t be like instant coffee or two-minutes noodles. In this new year, promise yourself no chemicals, no shortcut, exercise, yoga, good food, sleeping on time, some meditation and most importantly, happily accept how you look. After today, don’t live a filter life, live a fitter life,” Akshay said.
During the broadcast of Mann Ki Baat, Isha Foundation founder Sadhguru, Indian Women’s Cricket Team Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and chess legend Vishwanathan Anand also shared their fitness tips.

American Idol judge Paula Abdul sues producer Nigel Lythgoe for sexual assault,"Singer and dancer Paula Abdul filed a lawsuit accusing British television executive Nigel Lythgoe of sexually assaulting her when they worked together on two popular talent shows, American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance.","US singer, dancer and American Idol star Paula Abdul filed a lawsuit accusing British television executive Nigel Lythgoe of sexually assaulting her when they worked together on two popular talent shows, according to court documents.
Abdul, who rose to fame as a chart-topping singer in the late 1980s, alleged in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday that Lythgoe sexually assaulted her in an elevator during the early seasons of TV singing competition series American Idol.
Lythgoe, the producer of several hit television talent competitions, allegedly groped Abdul’s breasts and genitals, among other unwanted physical contact in a hotel elevator after a day of auditions for American Idol. Abdul tried to push him away and ran as soon as the elevator doors opened, court documents said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Abdul or Lythgoe for comment. Lythogoe denied the allegations, according to TMZ.
“For more than two decades, Paula and I have interacted as dear – and entirely platonic – friends and colleagues,” he told TMZ. “Yesterday, however, out of the blue, I learned of these claims in the press and I want to be clear: not only are they false, they are deeply offensive to me and to everything I stand for.”
According to court documents, Abdul immediately reported the assault by Lythgoe, an American Idol producer at the time, to her representatives but did not take action for fear of losing her job, the lawsuit said.
Moreover, Abdul’s contracts prohibited her from speaking out, the lawsuit said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Another alleged assault took place years later when Abdul worked as a judge on So You Think You Can Dance, according to court documents. The star, 61, enjoyed renewed popularity in the early 2000s starring as a judge on talent TV series.
The lawsuit alleges Lythgoe, 74, assaulted her on the couch of his Los Angeles home after a work dinner. Abdul again firmly rejected him and “immediately left Lythgoe’s home,” court documents said.
In the lawsuit, Abdul levels other allegations at the entertainment industry mogul, including that Lythgoe once called to taunt her and said it had been “seven years and the statute of limitations had run” on the alleged assaults.
The lawsuit alleged that the star also witnessed Lythgoe assault one of her assistants on So You Think You Can Dance.

The lawsuit was submitted days before the Dec. 31 filing deadline established under the California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act. The legislation allows individuals to bring certain sexual abuse lawsuits that would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations.

"Most popular actors of 2023: Shah Rukh Khan reclaims ‘Badshah’ status; Vijay, Ranbir Kapoor got audience back to theatres","As we look back at the year 2023, here is a list of actors who dominated the Indian box office, with their charm and acting prowess.","The last few years brought the film industry to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Movies got pushed, actors itched to return to the silver screens and theatre owners waited for people to queue up at the ticket counters. Come 2023, normalcy was resumed — audiences crowded cinema halls and even bought movie tickets at hefty prices (tickets for Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan sold for Rs 2100 at some places) to satiate their appetite for big-screen entertainment. Actors, who were long considered as the most reliable ones to fill seats, made the most of the audience’s mood and reclaimed their status as box office stars, thus saving the sinking boat of the Indian movie marketplace.
Shah Rukh Khan propelled Siddharth Anand’s Pathaan and Atlee’s Jawan to financial heights, while Ranbir Kapoor delivered back-to-back hits with Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar and Animal. The Deols – Dharmendra, Sunny and Bobby – reclaimed the spotlight and gave three hits individually with Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Gadar 2 and Animal.

Priyanka Chopra’s mother Madhu says ‘nuclear family set-up should be thrown out of the window’,"Madhu Chopra, mother of actor Priyanka Chopra, spoke about the importance of family in their life.","Priyanka Chopra’s mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, said that nobody is prepared to be a parent, and that if things were left to her, she’d abolish the ‘nuclear family set-up’ completely. In the book Raising Stars, by Rashmi Uchil, she said that her daughter makes sure to mention her family in her interviews, because she was raised by a team. Madhu was busy with her career when Priyanka and her brother, Siddhant, were growing up, and her children were mainly raised by relatives.
“I am the proudest mom and Priyanka is my favorite topic of conversation. I take so much pride in my children. I gave so little. In return, Priyanka has blossomed so much,” she said, adding that a mother’s influence on their child amounts to 95%, whereas the father and the rest of the family contribute the remaining 5%. Priyanka was sent to boarding school when she was very young, and in her teens, she was sent to the United States. In an earlier interview, Madhu said that neither of her children has ever complained about her being absent from their lives when they were growing up.

Even the film’s detractors have agreed that Vicky’s performance was one of Dunki’s highlights. But did you know that the role of Sukhi landed in Vicky’s lap by chance, and that Hirani originally intended to cast newcomers for all the side characters, including Sukhi?
Reflecting on an early conversation with Dunki’s stunt director and Vicky’s father, Sham Kaushal, Hirani told NDTV, “As we were chatting, the topic of casting came up. When he asked about the ideal boy for the role of Sukhi, I mentioned, ‘A boy like Vicky would be perfect’. However, I made it clear that I wouldn’t offer him the role because it’s a small role. Now he’s doing lead roles, so I wouldn’t offer it to him. Sham didn’t say anything.”

"‘When husband hits you, TRPs will increase’: Amruta Subhash recalls ‘disgusting’ comment by TV producer, was told, ‘This isn’t Prithvi theatre’","Ratna Pathak Shah and Amruta Subhash spoke about the rise of hyper-masculine action cinema in recent months, and said that until society evolves, movies won't.","Actor Ratna Pathak Shah expressed relief about the influx of talented writers and directors in the streaming space, but said that mainstream theatrical films still look down upon their audience, and insist on spoon-feeding them. She said that as a culture, Indians are accustomed to thinking that ‘papa knows best’, and that same mentality translates into our cinema.
At a roundtable discussion organised by Zoom Entertainment, her co-panelist, Amruta Subhash, spoke highly about action films, and said that they are very difficult to execute because there’s so much that could go wrong. Ratna wasn’t as forgiving. She said, “I think it’s a trend that has been foisted upon us, and has been encouraged, over many, many decades. And it’s not something that’ll go away. It’ll reinvent itself in different ways. There is a large audience that is keen on seeing that. They sublimate what they are seeing in their lives through characters of this type, and until our society changes, I don’t think these kind of films changing. They’ll keep coming back.”

"Rajkumar Hirani explains ‘donkey flight technique’, details how 276 passengers on plane grounded in France intended to enter Europe","Centred around the illegal immigration technique known as 'donkey flight', Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan, has sparked significant discussions on the topic since its release.","Despite facing tough competition at the box office from director Prashanth Neel’s Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire, director Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, has been showcasing a commendable performance, and has so far earned a global gross of over Rs 340 crore in just nine days.
Centred around the illegal immigration technique known as ‘donkey flight’, the film has sparked significant discussions on the topic since its release. A recent incident involving a charter plane carrying 276 passengers — mostly Indians — being grounded in France for four days due to suspected human trafficking, before being sent back to Mumbai, has once again brought attention to the subject.

Opening up about the technique and the incident, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani recently told NDTV, “Such reports surface every month. Not a single month goes by without reports of people crossing borders in such ways. Since we are more aware of this now, it immediately captures our attention when it makes the news.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“In Dunki, the flashback is set in 1995. Nowadays, several countries provide Indians with visas upon arrival. So the method to illegally immigrate has changed. In the past, people used to physically cross borders from India to Pakistan, then to Afghanistan, followed by Turkey. From there, they would travel by boat to Greece, then move on to Italy and then France. This was one of the donkey routes. Sometimes people also went through Russia,” he explained.

Mentioning that the 276 passengers grounded in France were en route to Nicaragua — a country that grants Indian passport holders visas on arrival — Hirani remarked, “Once they reach there, they would then cross borders and go to Europe.” He added, “But if you go to Punjab and say ‘Dunki lagani hai’ (Want to commute via the donkey route), they will immediately understand what you mean. Everyone in that state knows what it signifies.”
Hirani said that while researching the subject, he spoke to people who either knew somebody who’d ‘done the dunki’, or was in the process of doing it themselves. He spoke to a man from Punjab who was in Mexico, and was sure that he’d made it across the border in a few months.

Ratna Pathak Shah says directors in her time were more interested in discussing the lunch menu than scenes: ‘Aaj sarson ka saag mangate hain’,"Actor Ratna Pathak Shah rued about the state of the Hindi film industry earlier in her career, and said that directors were more interested in discussing the lunch menu than scenes.","Actor Ratna Pathak Shah expressed appreciation for filmmakers of today, and said that in her time, most directors had no idea what they were doing. Ratna participated in a roundtable discussion for Zoom Entertainment, which also included actors Sobhita Dhulipala, Amruta Subhash and Rajshri Deshpande, each of whom has worked with Anurag Kashyap. As they were appreciating how he handles actors on his sets, Ratna said that she didn’t have the same sort of freeing experience with the filmmakers she worked with earlier in her career.
She said, “I have come from a time where directors really did not know. You sat around set for hours, waiting for a scene to come, waiting for things to get organised, waiting for a prop which was written on the first page of the scene but has still not come. Every little thing was a problem. And in the meantime, they would discuss, ‘Iski picture kaisi chali? Lunch mein kya ayega? Aaj toh sarson ka saag manga lete hain (How did that guy’s film do? What’s for lunch?). They’d have a long, two-hour discussion on what we’re going to eat. They weren’t bothered about the scene.”

Backing his viewpoint with examples like his Dream Girl 2, Akshay Kumar’s OMG 2 and Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2, Khurrana told Variety, “There was a conspiracy theory, maybe a year back, that Indian audiences [were] only looking for spectacles or larger-than-life films, but this year, a lot of films [like the aforementioned ones], which were not really big budget but mid-budget, did really well.”

Salaar director Prashanth Neel responds to allegations of inflated box office numbers: ‘Misrepresentation and all of these things are heresy’,"Salaar director Prashanth Neel commented on the big clash between Dunki and Salaar. As per him, the clash was only in the mind of the fans as actors or directors ""are not here to compete among ourselves"".","The release of Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki and Prabhas’ Salaar, one day apart from each other, was deemed as the biggest box office clash of the year. The fans of both the actors indulged in a war of words on social media and there was also a fight for the screens for both the films. Recently, Salaar director Prashanth Neel commented on the big clash. As per him, the clash was only in the mind of the fans as actors or directors “are not here to compete among ourselves”.
Speaking to Pinkvilla, Neel said, “What happens with cinema is you root for your heroes and the emotions get the better of you. It might be that way for the fans but with us, we are not trying to compete with one another. We are both surviving together. I don’t advocate being a part of something like that. It’s nasty is what I heard. I really wish it didn’t come down to something like that because both the stars are huge in Indian cinema and they deserve the respect they have accumulated over all these years.”

The filmmaker believes that such an environment “is not good for cinema”. But since “there’s no way to control something like that, you would rather ignore it. You just let it pass.” While Dunki was released in the theatres on December 21, Salaar arrived on December 22. But there was a huge difference between the opening box office collection of both. Salaar earned Rs 90.7 crore and Dunki took an opening of Rs 29.2 crore.
Neel said, “It is not a war between Dunki and Salaar. I don’t think either the makers of Dunki or Salaar think like that. We are here to survive and impress the audience. We are not here to compete among ourselves. This is not a cricket match.” The filmmaker also understands the feelings of the fans as he said that they are just “possessive” about their favourite star.
The director was also asked about the ‘misconstruction of numbers’ referring to the allegations that box office numbers of the films that are released for public consumption might not be correct. “If this was a solo release, I don’t think this would have come up,” Prashanth said. He further added that he doesn’t take the audience to be foolish and believes that they can see through such things. He said, “Misrepresentation and all of these things are heresy. You want to hear more negatives than positives.”

"Ratna Pathak Shah says she wasn’t as good as Smita Patil, Shabana Azmi in the ’80s: ‘I was a pretty dumb person’",Ratna Pathak Shah recently opened up about the initial days of her career and the reasons behind her delayed success.,"2023 was a comparatively better year for Ratna Pathak Shah, as the veteran actor was featured in three web series and one film. She kicked off 2023 with the crime drama series Trial by Fire and also took on the lead role in the comedy series Happy Family: Conditions Apply. Following that, she appeared in the mystery thriller show Charlie Chopra & The Mystery Of Solang Valley and concluded the year with the road adventure film Dhak Dhak.
Though she commenced her silver screen journey with Shyam Benegal’s classic satirical comedy Mandi (1983), Ratna became more actively involved in cinema in the last decade or so. However, in the past few years, she has been gracing screens with unconventional and nuanced characters, captivating audiences.

Meanwhile, she recently opened up about the initial days of her career and the reasons behind her delayed success. Reflecting on her debut in Mandi, she humorously mentioned, “If you blinked for two and a half minutes while watching it, you would miss me. I was just hanging around there, frankly. Naseer and I had just gotten married, and he had to go off for a shoot. Shyam asked me to come along with him, and I did. So, I was just a total hanger-on. I have been a bloody hanger-on for years,” she recalled during a conversation with Zoom TV.

Reminiscing about her role in Ketan Mehta’s Mirch Masala, Ratna mentioned that her part was very miniscule. She acknowledged that these filmmakers, unfortunately, didn’t know how she could fit in. “I have to admit, I wasn’t very good. I didn’t even have a particularly unusual face like Smita (Patil) or Shabana (Azmi). They sort of changed the way you look at women on screen. Mine (face) was neither here nor there. So, I am not surprised that they (the filmmakers) didn’t imagine that I could do more than whatever I did,” she explained.

She also reminisced about working with Ketan Mehta on a play titled The Lesson, penned by French-Romanian playwright Eugène Ionesco, at the age of 18 when she had just started her career. “I was even more of an idiot than I was later. I don’t think I understood anything. Whatever Ketan said, I sort of tried to do…”
Emphasising that that era was exceptional, Ratna mentioned she was always observing their works. “It was a very useful experience for me. I learned a great deal watching these people work. I was a pretty dumb person back then so I was trying to soak in everything I could get. Nobody starts out right. You start at Point A, and if you remain there, you are an idiot. But if you progress from Point A to B, C, and D, that means you did some work,” she added.

"Rajkumar Hirani says box office is not the right barometer to judge a film: ‘Debate should be about content, not money’","Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan, is being pitted against Prabhaas-starrer Salaar at the box office.","Rajkumar Hirani’s latest release Dunki, starring Shah Rukh Khan, released a few days ago and has been competing against Prabhas-starrer Salaar for a few days now. The box office collections of both these films are being compared to one another and Hirani has now said that more than the collections, one should speak about the content of the film.
In an interview with ANI, Hirani spoke about the impact that the publicity of box office collections have on audience. “I feel it’s temporary and it is possible that people get influenced. A person can hear something negative and it is possible that he won’t go. It does have a little impact but in the longer run, that person will see it. If not here (theatre), then may be on OTT or satellite and then his love will stay with the film,” he said,
He added, “I still feel that a barometer to judge a film should be… jo debate honi chahiye wo paiso se zyada film ki honi chahiye, film ke content se hone lagi hai. Thoda sa hum ye paiso se karne lage hai, ye tha nahi pehle, ye thoda sa badh gaya hai abhi. (The debate around a film should be more about its content than the money. These days we focus a little more on money.) Earlier, we used to go for a film innocently. We used to talk about the film but now the discussion around numbers has increased.”

Dunki stars Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role where he is helping out his friends to get to London via an illegal route. This film is Shah Rukh’s third release this year after blockbuster action-entertainers Pathaan and Jawan.
Calling the actor ‘brave’, Rajkumar said that Shah Rukh was invested in the film ever since he first heard about it. “When you make a film, you make it because you like the story and Shah Rukh has been involved in the story from its inception. From the time I showed him the photograph of the plane, he was very curious. He is a brave actor and every actor wants to try something different. He did action films, so he wouldn’t want to keep doing that. He was very involved, very happy with the story,” he said.
The filmmaker also shared how he has been wanting to work with the actor for several years now and Dunki gave him the chance. Rajkumar described working with Shah Rukh as a lot of fun and added that he is “great man who showers love on everyone.”
The director’s previous films including Sanju, PK, and 3 Idiots were celebrated for their box office collections.

In an interview with The Free Press Journal, Madhu called Nick and Priyanka a “befitting match.” She said, “Through my daughter Priyanka, I am earning double the benefit of what I had given to my parents and in-laws. Priyanka has imbibed one thing from us i.e. family support is of utmost importance. She has seen her father taking care of them when I was away in an emergency. Today, she has made us feel proud by looking after her daughter Malti so well. Both Nick and Priyanka are really lucky as they are a befitting match.”

"Tamil Cinema 2023: Jailer to Leo, biggies are the highlight of a decent year",Tamil cinema experts dissect the highs and lows of 2023.,"In stark contrast to the clarity of 2022, this year defies easy categorization. While the previous year unequivocally silenced discussions about the demise of theaters, showcasing a diverse range of blockbusters from intimate family dramas like Thiruchitrambalam to the pan-Indian spectacle of KGF Chapter 2, 2023 took a more nuanced turn. The triumphant return of Mani Ratnam with the film adaptation of Ponniyin Selvan and the success of Kamal Haasan’s Vikram stood out. However, the real victor was Karthi, not the usual superstars, with three hits that reverberated across the industry. However, uncertainty lingers around the progress card of 2023, which is marked by both the highest number of releases and notable failures among big-budget films. To decode the nuances of the past year, Indian Express engaged in discussions with industry experts producer-distributor G Dhananjeyan, Vetri Theatre owner Rakesh Gowthaman, and film trade analyst Ramesh Bala.

Stars Dimmed?
In 2022, stars like PS 1, Vikram, and Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu scored dual victories as they emerged as blockbusters and critical favorites. However, this time, the stars fell short of expectations. Karthi, riding high on the successes of Sardar, Komban, and PS 1, faced a setback with Japan, emerging as one of the year’s biggest disappointments. Mani Ratnam’s PS 2 also failed to captivate audiences like the first part. Despite a promising start with Vijay’s Varisu and Ajith’s Thunivu, the hits became sporadic, as noted by Rakesh Gowthaman. “Leo, Jailer, and Varisu were exceptions; mid-level and small-budget films struggled. After Thunivu and Varisu, the next hit, Viduthalai: Part 1, arrived in March. The lull continued, with movies like Dada having modest success. Ponniyin Selvan 2, expected to be a blockbuster, did not match the hype, resulting in a lackluster summer. Hits like Maamannan, Maaveeran, Jailer, and Leo offered some relief, but overall, 2023 proved middling. Even the much-anticipated Maaveeran fell short of Sivakarthikeyan’s best. Dhanush, Karthi, and Suriya didn’t make a significant impact.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Contrary to this perspective, Dhananjeyan contends that 2023 was far from a dismal year for Tamil cinema, citing the record number of film releases – a staggering 256. “Despite a potentially lower ratio of hits to releases due to the sheer volume, the industry’s turnover has seen a remarkable increase. This indicates a thriving business, doesn’t it? Out of the 190 small-budget films released (made with less than Rs 5 crore), only a handful became hits, affecting the success ratio. However, the actual number of hits has risen.”
A Silver Lining
Ramesh Bala, offering a more optimistic view, sees the success of Por Thozhil as a significant positive for Tamil cinema. In an era where marketing expenses often match the film budget, he points to Por Thozhil’s minimal promotion yet substantial success, earning around Rs 40 crore gross. This achievement, he suggests, gives hope to filmmakers that quality content can yield results, even without extravagant promotion. “About 90 percent of films made here are small-budget ventures. Por Thozhil was one of them, and no one knew about it till its release. It worked solely because of word-of-mouth reviews, and I think it will give hope for many such filmmakers.”
Pan-Indian Films Lose Luster
Although Rakesh and Dhananjeyan disagree on their assessments of Tamil cinema’s overall progress, they concur that Pan-Indian films have lost their appeal. Despite the sensational successes of 2022, such as KGF: Chapter 2, Kantara, Sita Ramam, RRR, and Charlie 777, the trend faltered in 2023, with Jawan being an exception. “Tamil filmmakers must overcome their reluctance to release films alongside Pan-Indian productions from other states. This year, none of the Pan-Indian films, including Adipurush, Salaar, or Dunki, found success. The optimism of 2022 has waned, and 2023 has disappointed theatre owners, albeit with exception like Jailer,” opines Rakesh.
Dhananjeyan concurs, stating, “Jawan is the sole exception, and even with Atlee, Nayanthara, and Vijay Sethupathi, it leaned more towards being a Tamil movie. This year, Salaar didn’t meet expectations, signaling a failure of Pan-Indian films in Tamil cinema.”
Challenges on the Horizon
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite the landmark successes of films like Jailer and Leo, which resonated beyond regional borders, Rakesh dismisses the notion that these triumphs compensate for the void left by mid-level film failures. “The Tamil cinema market has expanded, but individual theater collections remain static. While there are more centers and avenues for Tamil cinema, the revenue for producers remains largely unchanged. The ticket price hike from Rs 120 to Rs 190 hasn’t translated to a substantial increase in earnings.”
Dhananjeyan, wearing his producer and distributor hat, identifies two imminent challenges for Tamil cinema. “OTT platforms are acquiring fewer films, presenting a challenge for the industry. Out of the 256 films released this year, only 140 found a place on digital platforms. Additionally, theatres face dwindling audience interest in smaller films, as viewers increasingly prefer watching them on OTT platforms. While a film like Por Thozhil stands out, it cannot single-handedly transform the industry. The audience must support smaller films, and OTTs need to expand their acquisition of such content.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/tamil-cinema-2023-jailer-to-leo-biggies-are-the-highlight-of-a-decent-year-9083782/,entertainment
"Pierce Brosnan is in hot water, accused of trespassing in a Yellowstone thermal area","Pierce Brosnan walked in an off-limits area at Mammoth Terraces, in the northern part of Yellowstone near the Wyoming-Montana line, on November 1.","Pierce Brosnan, whose fictitious movie character James Bond has been in hot water plenty of times, is now facing heat in real life, charged with stepping out of bounds in a thermal area during a recent visit to Yellowstone National Park.
Brosnan walked in an off-limits area at Mammoth Terraces, in the northern part of Yellowstone near the Wyoming-Montana line, on November 1, according to two federal citations issued on Tuesday.
Pierce Brosnan, 70, is scheduled for a mandatory court appearance on January 23 in the courtroom of the world’s oldest national park. The Associated Press sent a request for comment to his Instagram account on Thursday, and email messages to his agent and attorney.

Yellowstone officials declined to comment. Brosnan was in the park on a personal visit and not for film work, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Wyoming said.
Mammoth Terraces is a scenic spot of mineral-encrusted hot springs bubbling from a hillside. They’re just some of the park’s hundreds of thermal features, which range from spouting geysers to gurgling mud pots, with water at or near the boiling point.
Going out-of-bounds in such areas can be dangerous: Some of the millions of people who visit Yellowstone each year get badly burned by ignoring warnings not to stray off the trail.
Getting caught can bring legal peril too, with jail time, hefty fines and bans from the park handed down to trespassers regularly.

In addition to his four James Bond films, Pierce Brosnan starred in the 1980s TV series Remington Steele and is known for starring roles in the films Mrs. Doubtfire and The Thomas Crown Affair.

Salaar’s box office collection on the eighth day was Rs 9.62 crore by 9 pm, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. This brings the film’s total nett collection in India to Rs 317.62 crore.

"Sivakarthikeyan reveals reason behind delay in Ayalaan release, confirms second part","In a recent interview, Sivakarthikeyan opened up about Ayalaan, and the reason behind its delay, financial constraints, and more.","Actor Sivakarthikeyan’s long-delayed film Ayalaan will be finally released on Pongal and compete with Dhanush’s Captain Miller, and Aishwarya Rajinikanth’s Laal Salaam. Ayalaan, a sci-fi action drama, was announced way back in 2016. However, it has taken more than seven years for the film to see the light of day. In a recent interview, Sivakarthikeyan opened up about the reasons behind the delay, and the financial problems the film went through. He also assured that a second part of the movie is on the cards.
Talking about the film, Siva told Galatta Plus, “I loved director Ravikumar’s Netru Indru Naalai… how he had pulled off such a film with limited means. So, when he told me he had an idea for a story about an alien meeting me, I told him we are doing it. Later, we started working on the story and it has become what it is now.”

When asked about the reason behind the delay of Ayalaan, Sivakarthikeyan said, “As far as Ayaalan is concerned, it is a vision to make such a film in Tamil on a limited budget. When I say small budget, it is a huge one for me. It is not a film made with Rs 200 crore, but it will look like it is that big. There is no reference for us while making the film. We just have Hollywood films, but we can’t ape them. So, it took a long time to make it. If not for the pandemic, we would have finished way earlier.”
ADVERTISEMENT
He added, “Software companies could function from home, but CGI work can’t be done since no one has systems that powerful at home. So, it came to a halt. Then we had to start all over again. Initially, there were financial problems. Then we sorted it all out and when we were about to make the film, COVID hit. Then we had to wait and do it. But the delay has helped him (Ravikumar) use new technologies in the film. I can assure you that no other Indian film has been made like Ayalaan. It will be a new experience for the audience.”
Talking about the financial issues, he added, “It is true that there were fund issues, but it is not a film that can be salvaged with a small budget. We wanted to do justice to it and so we waited to make it work. There was a time when it looked like the project couldn’t be finished, but now, it is ready for release. We are going to see the final in a few days. We have overcome all the struggles to get here, and it will be released on Pongal.”
Sivakarthikeyan is sure of Ayalaan’s success and he is confident that there will be a second part to the film. “Making the film has been a learning in itself that we now have an idea of what to do. So, we have now figured out there are other ways to achieve what we want and we will be using it for part 2. Yes, I believe that this character will be liked by all, and I think there is a scope for a part 2.”

Vijayakanth laid to rest at DMDK headquarters with full state honour,"Vijayakanth, who passed away on Thursday morning, was laid to rest at his party headquarters with full state honour. Many political leaders and celebrities were present at the funeral.","Vijayakanth, the founder of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), was laid to rest at his party headquarters in Koyambedu, Chennai with full state honour. 72 rounds of gunshots were fired to honour the veteran actor-politician. Many political leaders and celebrities including Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, Ministers TR Balu, Udhayanidhi Stalin, KN Nehru, former CM O Panneerselvam, BJP leader Tamilisai Soundarajan, GK Vasan, and Jeyakumar were present at the funeral. The whole of Koyembedu was jam-packed with people pouring in from different parts of the state to get a last glimpse of ‘Captain’.
Ahead of the funeral, the mortal remains of Vijayakanth were taken for a final journey across the streets of Chennai. People stood on either side of the streets and threw flowers at the vehicle. Vijayakanth’s sons Shanmugha Pandian and Vijay Prabhakaran were on the van thanking the public.
Vijayakanth was laid to rest in a coffin made of sandalwood. “Puratchi Kalaingan Captain Vijayakanth” was engraved on the coffin.

Earlier, Rajinikanth, who was spotted at Tutucorin airport, expressed his condolences. He said,  “My heart aches. Vijayakanth was a man with great willpower. Lastly, I saw him at the DMDK’s genral body meeting and thought he would bounce back after battling his health issues. His death is a huge loss to the people of Tamil Nadu.”
The actor added, “If he was healthy, he would have been a formidable force in politics. He would have done so many good deeds for the people. People of Tamil Nadu have now lost him. May his soul rest in peace.”
Vijayakanth, whose original name is Narayanan Vijayaraj Alagarswami, rebelled against his dad who wanted him to take care of the family business of running a rice mill. He, however, had dreams of becoming an actor and realised it after many struggles in the industry which looked down upon dark-skinned actors and outsiders.

Over the years, Vijayakanth became a formidable force in Kollywood churning out hits that were on par with the films of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. Captain Prabhakaran, Vaidheigi Kaathirundhaal, Oor Katha Kaavalan, Nooraavathu Naal, Oomai Vizhigal, Naane Raja Naane Mandhiri, Chinna Gounder, Vaanathai Pola, Chatriyan, and Ramana are some of his biggest hits.
The actor, who always had political aspirations and was a believer in Dravidian ideology, made his foray into politics by floating his party in 2008. The start of DMDK became a new chapter in Tamil Nadu as it became the third-largest party in a very short time. Vijayakanth also served as the leader of the opposition between the years 2011 to 2014.
Later, due to a health issue, the actor couldn’t be at his best, which affected the electoral performance of his party. The leadership was later transferred to his wife Premalatha.
Vijayakanth was suffering from a lung-related illness and was admitted to MIOT hospital a few weeks ago. He was discharged on December 11. However, the actor-politician tested positive for coronavirus and was hospitalized again on Tuesday. After being put on ventilator support, Vijayakanth breathed his last on Thursday morning, leaving millions of his fans and followers devastated.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/vijayakanth-laid-to-rest-at-dmdk-headquarters-with-full-state-honour-9087623/,entertainment
Reacher Season 2 review: Alan Ritchson series delivers the goods,"The story-telling in Reacher Season 2 is basic, but it gets the job done without wasting any time, and it’s all just as it should be, for Reacher fans.","Reacher is back. And all’s well with the world. Or will be, as soon as he and his three pals– whose bonds go back to the time when they were in the military together–rumble the bad guys, destroy them, and, as best-selling author Lee Child has them succinctly declare, ‘piss on their ancestors’ grave.’ End of matter.
In season one, we were introduced to Alan Ritchson, who instantly fixed the major problem with the two feature films in which Tom Cruise tried being Jack Reacher: Ritchson was six feet plus, as big horizontally as he was vertically, just the way Child’s eponymous hero ought to have been, instead of the compact Cruise.
It was impossible to buy the suave Hollywood star as the big-as-a-boardwalk ex-Army drifter who lives rough, packs a toothbrush as his only luggage, refuses to be tied down by real estate-and-paperwork, and roams around the US countryside, passing through small towns in which live big villains, dealing with them the only way he knows how: getting in his massive blow, or head-butt, first.
ADVERTISEMENT
In season 2, based on Child’s 11th novel ‘Bad Luck And Trouble’, and developed by Nick Santora, he looms even larger, and is as fearsome. This time around, things have got personal: a member of his old Army unit has been murdered in the most brutal fashion, and it looks like someone has it in for the rest of them. Back when they were a tightly-knit band, they had a saying: you do not mess with the Special Investigators. Now someone clearly has, and as far as Reacher is concerned, that’s the end of that someone. Or someones.
The three friends who get together with Reacher on this mission are remnants of that old unit. Their addition makes things more interesting, especially when we need a bit of chatter in between all the action: thumping people with his bare hands is the big man’s forte; he leaves conversation to other people. Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), whom we met briefly in the first season, is back with her sharp sleuthing instincts: David O’Donnell (Shaun Sipos) as the spiffy knife-man, and Karla Dixon ( Serinda Swan) as the numbers whizz, slip into step smoothly, as we follow them from New York to Vegas and all kinds of places in between as they start tracking those who killed their friends.

In the first season in early 2022, we got all the episodes at once. This new series has launched with three episodes together, followed by one every week. Five episodes down, three to go, and we’ve had one-on-one combats, car crashes, gun battles, cops-hot-the-trail-of-Reacher, a very bad guy leaving a trail of bodies in his wake, fancy weapon prototypes, dirty drugs dealers, bent arms manufacturers.

"Nag Ashwin says he felt he was doing ‘engineering, not filmmaking’ while making Kalki 2898 AD, reveals relevance of film’s title","Recently, Nag Ashwin attended an event at IIT Bombay, where he spoke about his dystopian drama, the film's title and his experience of working with stalwarts like Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan.","Nag Ashwin directorial Kalki 2898 AD, starring Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Kamal Haasan, among others, is being touted as “India’s Mytho-Sci-fi Epic” by the makers. Recently, Ashwin attended an event at IIT Bombay, where he spoke about his dystopian drama, the film’s title and his experience of working with stalwarts like Bachchan and Haasan.
When an audience member asked Ashwin, why the film, which was earlier called Project K, has been titled Kalki 2898 AD and why specifically the 2898 AD, the filmmaker replied, “There is one logic to it which I will reveal closer to the film’s release date. But there is a logic, I don’t know how true or accurate it is.” When another person asked why Kalki, the director added, “It’s a very powerful name and it is something which is connected to present and past, and that’s what the story (of the film) is.” The tenth avatar of Lord Vishnu is also called Kalki.
Going by the teaser which was unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023, Kalki 2898 AD looks like it revolves around a war between two factions. The film is backed by an able cast and Nag Ashwin had a great time working with them. “All of them are very humble and make the life of their director easy. They love cinema,” the filmmaker said about Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan and Prabhas.

Kalki 2898 AD has been in the making for almost 4-5 years now, and during its making, Ashwin felt he is doing “engineering, not filmmaking” as everything, from the props and costumes to the sets was built “from scratch”.
“In India, we do not have a lot of sci-fi films. We have done a few time travel films. This one is different because it’s in a whole separate world on its own. Also, in the international sense, it is new because we have not seen India in a future setting or dystopian setting. So now we don’t have to look at London and New York being born, now we can see our cities also,” Aswin spoke about his film.
He added, “This movie took place in the cusp between before and after Midjourney and before and after Chat GPT. First two years, we did a lot of work and then we realised a lot of work became easier after this text-to-image and image-to-text generator happened.”

"Rajesh Khanna: The OG ‘King of Romance’ who irked Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Yash Chopra with his ‘starry tantrums’","On Rajesh Khanna's 81st birth anniversary, we look back at his illustrious career, record of delivering 15 consecutive hits and abrupt downfall.","‘Zindagi kaisi hai paheli, kabhi toh hasaaye, kabhi ye rulaaye’
There couldn’t have been a better song written for Rajesh Khanna – the handsome, twinkle-eyed heart-stealer of late 1960s and 1970s Hindi cinema. With his boy-next-door looks, chivalry and his swoon-worthy romantic actions, he robbed the audience of critical thinking and charmed them, especially women, with his roles of a lover. He came at a time when the audience was done revering middle-aged heroes (Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar) and wanted a new generation actor to express their dreams and desires onscreen. Not just youngsters, but even the older generation lapped up this storehouse of talent.
“In all my films, people identified strongly with my character. Every college girl wanted a boyfriend like me, every mother wanted her son to be like me, and every sister wanted her brother to be like me. All the married women dreamt of a husband like me. Together, they made Rajesh Khanna the screen idol that he was,” the actor had said in a 1989 interview.

Rajesh Khanna was unlike today’s stars. He didn’t have a well-built physique or looks that would stop people in their tracks, yet he managed to turn heads as he brought a stamp of class and sensitivity to his characters. Moviegoers connected with him as he conveyed their emotional vulnerabilities on screen with the utmost sincerity and passion. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, as actor Rakhee told Etimes, believed, “Nobody can compete with Rajesh Khanna. It is impossible. He wasn’t there for his body and height but just for his face, smile and eyes.”
While he did impress with his initial films like Aakhri Khat (1966), Raaz (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Khanna came to his own and became invincible with Aradhana (1969), Do Raaste (1969), Ittefaq (1969), Safar (1970), Kati Patang (1971), Khamoshi (1969), and several others. Actor Deepti Naval, who watched Khanna’s Aradhana thirteen times with her sister, told Scroll, “He was the dream man of every girl. I felt no other actor could have done ‘Roop tera mastana’ like Rajesh Khanna, treading a fine line between forbidden love and desire…” Naval and her sister even wore a Guru kurta to watch his film Safar. “We were that crazy about Rajesh Khanna.” Not just the actor and her sister, millions of girls were in love with the ‘superstar’. He used to receive fan mail in abundance, some of which were supposedly written in blood. His car would be covered in lipstick marks wherever it was parked.

Sharmila Tagore said in an interview with The Indian Express, “Women came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse. They would marry his photographs, and they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.”
Born Jatin Khanna, on December 29, 1942, in Amritsar, Punjab, the actor was brought up by foster parents, Chunnilal and Leelawati Khanna, and he never spoke of his biological parents. He was a much-pampered kid who attended Mumbai’s St Sebastian Goan High School, where he became friends with Ravi Kapoor, who later gained popularity as Jeetendra. After completing his studies at Kishinchand Chelleram College, Khanna, who was already doing theatre, decided to pursue acting. He approached several filmmakers with his pictures but got no response from them. But Khanna’s struggle story was a little different from others as he came from a well-to-do family that was willing to support him financially. Gautam Chintamani’s biography on the actor mentioned that he “drove to auditions in a car and had a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000.”
Mumtaz and Rajesh Khanna were hit on-screen pair.
In 1965, he was presented with a unique opportunity as some of the famous producers and directors from the Hindi film industry, including BR Chopra, Guru Dutt, and Bimal Roy, organised a talent contest along with Filmfare to find a new face for the film industry.

Rajesh Khanna beat 10,000 contestants and won the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare. The talent hunt contract specified that 12 different producers would sign the winner for 12 films. Hence, a golden chance to rise to stardom. The first film he signed was GP Sippy’s Raaz and subsequently, Chetan Anand approached him for Aakhri Khat. Though he was happy to have gotten two films early in his career, what bothered him was the call time for Raaz, which was 9 am. He told Bhawana Somaya for ‘Echoes of an Era’, “Now, waking up early is just not my style. I am not an early bird. From childhood, I have always risen late. My mother wouldn’t allow anyone to enter my room and disturb me. So when the director told me about attending shooting early in the morning, my heart sank.”

On the day of the shoot, Khanna arrived at 11 am and instead of being apologetic, he hit back at a senior team member who questioned his behaviour despite being a newcomer, “To hell with the career and to hell with this film. My lifestyle cannot change for my career.” This remained the actor’s attitude throughout his career, as confirmed by Prem Chopra in one of his interviews. “Rajesh Khanna was a great actor, but he had this habit of reaching late all the time. Not everyone would take it when he landed late on sets. Hours after everyone reached and got ready, he would reach the sets.” Even in her latest appearance on Koffee With Karan, when Sharmila Tagore was asked to describe Khanna in two words, she replied, “Perpetually late.”
However, filmmakers grew habitual of Khanna’s habit of always turning up late and continued to cast him for his impeccable screen presence. The actor holds the record of delivering 17 consecutive super-hits in three years from 1969-71, which included 15 successive solo super-hit films, starting with Ittefaq (1969) and Aradhana (1969). Ramesh Deo, who played Dr Prakash in Anand, recalled that Khanna was perpetually late on the sets of Anand, and this would infuriate Hrishikesh Mukherjee. But as soon as he saw what the actor did in front of the camera, his anger would melt away. In a 2012 conversation with DNA, Deo said, “Rajesh used to enact the scene so well, that after the scene, Hrishi-da used to say, ‘Tumne itna aacha kam kiya hai, tumhare sau gunah maaf (You have done such good work that all your sins are forgiven).’”

By the time Anand released in 1971, Khanna had reached the pinnacle of success and had become a ‘phenomenon’. The mass hysteria around him remains unbeatable to this day. In fact, at one point, he himself felt, “next to God”.

“He was the biggest star ever. From 1969 to 1975, the high that he touched became a benchmark that nobody could breach. You could identify with him. He had a very charming smile. He had a good voice and he also got really good music. When a person’s stars start working in his favour, then he gets support from every sphere,” screenwriter Salim Khan once said about Khanna to BBC.

However, by the mid-seventies, Rajesh Khanna’s hold over the box office had begun to slip, increasing his insecurities. He only wished to be surrounded by people who praised him, and those who spoke anything which was not favourable to him became his enemy. His starry tantrums were no longer taken by filmmakers and he was once reportedly slapped by Mehmood when he was directing him in Janta Hawaldar. Yash Chopra also couldn’t handle his “superstar tantrums on a regular basis”. In 1973, when Khanna worked with the emerging star Amitabh Bachchan, he believed nobody could replace him. Actor Asrani recalled in a 2018 interview with Filmfare, “There was a basic courtesy between the two but Rajesh suffered from a superiority complex. He believed ‘no one can shake me. I am too powerful.’ Throughout the film, there was palpable tension between the two.”
The dried-up offers were also a result of Khanna’s unwillingness to reinvent himself. “He continued the same style and those films did not work either. That is why he had to (suffer a downfall). He could not face that thing – where I was and where I am now,” Prem Chopra had said while explaining the superstar’s downfall from the numer-uno position.

The failure led him to alcoholism and one night after drinking, he started yelling from the terrace of his Mumbai bungalow, Ashirvaad. This was the phase of Khanna’s career when he had seven consecutive flops. “One after another, seven films had just flopped in a row. It was raining, pitch-dark and up there alone on my terrace, I lost control. I yelled out. ‘Parvardigar, hum garibon ka itna sakt imtihan na le ki hum tere vajood ko inkar kar de (God, don’t test my patience to such an extent that I question your very existence).’ Of course, Dimple (Kapadia, his wife) and my staff came running, thinking that I had gone insane. It was because success hit me so much that I couldn’t take the failure,” he shared with Movie Magazine in 1990.
One of the actor’s dialogues from Daag (1973) sums up the ups and downs of his life, which he later recreated on the stage at an event with much of the film industry in attendance, “Izzatein, shohratein, ulfatein, chahatein, sab kuch iss duniya mein rehta nahin/ Aaj main hun jahan kal koi aur tha/ Ye bhi ek daur hai woh bhi ek daur tha. (Nothing is permanent in life. somebody else was here where I am today).” A day came in Khanna’s life when he, who once felt “next to God”, thought of himself to be a ‘dog’.

He told Filmfare, “I used to ask my man Prashant to tell the caller that Kaka is having a bath and call up again just to feign importance and attend to the call only when the caller called up four times. God punished me and a time came when I used to stand next to the phone hoping that I would get a call. And when one day a call came, I picked the receiver and said,’ Kaka here,’ and then came the reply, ‘Kaun Kaka? Wrong Number.’ That was when I realized that I was not GOD but DOG.”

Rajesh Khanna continued to work in the 80s, but unlike the early 1970s, he failed to pull people to cinema halls. One of the last notable roles that he did was in Rishi Kapoor’s Aa Ab Laut Chelein in 1999.
At the peak of his career, Khanna married 16-year-old Dimple Kapadia, whom he met on a flight to Ahmedabad. The two got married six months before Kapadia’s Bobby released. But Kapadia knew her marriage with the superstar wouldn’t last long from the moment she stepped into his house. On The Pritish Nandy Show, the actor said she could not understand the superstar. Revisiting the pre-separation phase of her life, Kapadia said, “I think we were two very different kinds of people. I was probably very young to understand what was happening to this man, who was a superstar. I have never been able to understand stars and their behaviour pattern at all because I am not one myself. I just couldn’t understand.”

The duo separated in 1982 and have two daughters – Twinkle Khanna, who was born in 1974, and Rinkie Khanna, born in 1977.
Before marrying Dimple, Rajesh Khanna was in a seven-year-long relationship with Anju Mahendru. When he married Kapadia, he deliberately made his baraat parade before Anju’s house. After separating from Kapadia, he also got involved with Tina Munim, who allegedly left him because he didn’t divorce Kapadia.

Journalist Bhawana Somaaya summarised Khanna’s life in a Screen article which was published in 1987: “Rajesh Khanna became more rigid and withdrew into his shell. If Anju couldn’t cope with his success, Dimple couldn’t cope with his failure.”
But, all the people he was close to returned to him during his last days, including Dimple Kapadia and her daughter, and Anju Mahendru. He was admitted to Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital due to prolonged illness, but he insisted on dying in his bedroom. The family brought him back to Aashirvaad and tried to lift his spirit by saying that he will be well soon. But Khanna knew it was time on July 18, 2012. Yasser Usman revealed the actor’s last word in his biography, “Time up ho gaya [My time is up] . . . Pack up!”

"Dino Morea calls Bipasha Basu his favourite co-star, says Raaz was one of the most iconic films of 2000s",Dino Morea opened up about the start of his career and why he took a break.,"Dino Morea was one of the most famous models in the 1990s and when he made his debut in Hindi movies in the late 1990s with Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, the audience saw him as a part of the generation of actors who had something new to offer. Soon after, Dino appeared in the 2002 film Raaz with Bipasha Basu, which is possibly the most popular movie of his career. In a recent chat with Bollywood Bubble, Dino spoke about his debut film and called Bipasha his most favourite co-star.
Back in the day, Bipasha and Dino also dated each other and were not shy about discussing their relationship. When asked about his favourite co-star from the early 2000s, Dino said, “Bipasha, she was in most of my movies. She has to be my favourite co-star.” And when he was asked about the most iconic film of the early 2000s, Dino named his own film Raaz and said, “It was one of the biggest successes of 2002. That movie did hugely well even though we didn’t win a single award, which is very weird.”

Speaking about his debut film Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, Dino Morea recalled that “it was a lot of fun”. He said, “We were going city to city promoting our film. The songs were already a hit.” The actor added, “I come out of the theatre, people were pulling my jacket. It was just fantastic.”
Dino shared that he took a break from the movies around 2011 because he wasn’t getting the kind of offers that would have helped him advance his career. “When films don’t work one after the other, you keep wondering what’s going on and that’s when I made the conscious decision to say no to any work that was really not good. And I made that decision in 2011-2012. Every offer that came to me after that was just terrible and I just said no. You just have to have faith in yourself.” But five years later, things picked up again as Dino was offered The Empire, Tandav, Mentalhood and Hostages.
Dino Morea was last seen in the Telugu film Agent.

The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans,"The Mission movie review: National Geographic's new documentary captures the obsession, devotion and delusion that led American missionary John Allen Chau to his death in the Andaman Islands.","One of the most gut-wrenching scenes in all of modern cinema comes at the end of Werner Herzog’s 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man. The film tells the tragic story of Timothy Treadwell, an outdoorsy American man who made the mistake — as so many of Herzog’s protagonists do — of staring into the abyss without bothering to consider the consequences. Treadwell was killed by a grizzly bear that he’d deluded himself into thinking he could tame. They recovered audio of the fatal attack, which Herzog listens to on camera in the film, but crucially, restricts from the audience. It distressed him to the point that he instructed Treadwell’s ex-girlfriend to destroy it immediately.
Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss perhaps came across a similar ethical dilemma in their new film, The Mission, which in many ways can be seen as a thematic companion piece to Grizzly Man. Like Herzog’s classic, the documentary follows the exploits of another adventurer — the Evangelical missionary John Allen Chau — who got more than what he bargained for after making illegal contact with the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands. The Sentinelese are perhaps the world’s most isolated community, having fended away almost all attempts at communication by the outside world.

ADVERTISEMENT
Chau, a mixed-race American who grew up in the ‘90s, slowly became obsessed with the idea of converting the Sentinelese to Christianity. He believed that the island was Satan’s last great stronghold, and that only he could bring the Gospel of Christ to the 200-odd people who are said to live there. Chau wasn’t always a religious zealot, however. He grew up on The Adventures of Tintin and Robinson Crusoe, but found himself drifting away from conventional pop-culture in his teens, as he became completely entrenched in the Evangelical movement.
Chau’s life story is recounted in gorgeously animated sequences by his own father, who openly blames the Evangelicals for what happened to him. Chau was aware that the Indian government had forbidden all contact with the Sentinelese. He also knew that several past expeditions had ended with the Sentinelese giving clear warning signs to incoming explorers by aiming arrows at them. One of the most enduring images of the tribe — this also gives the film’s producers, National Geographic, a chance to offer internal critique about the west’s messiah complex — forever painting them as the savages in the eyes of the ‘civilised’ world.
The movie makes an honest attempt at capturing the complex blend of obsession, devotion, and delusion that sent John Allen Chau on his suicide mission. Perhaps the most interesting interviewee — the movie also features one of Chau’s old friends, and his many enablers from the Evangelical community — is the linguist Daniel Everett, who sees in Chau a kindred spirit, and harbours a vague sense of guilt over what happened to him. Everett spent decades with the Pirahã people of the Amazon, initially with the intention of teaching them the Lord’s ways. But in an unexpected turn of events, he found his own faith crumbling when the Pirahã started resisting his lessons.
He’s a fascinating character, someone who tears up at the mere memory of an old aphorism — “He gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.” — and freely admits that his three-decade mission might have been a waste of time. Whatever statements that The Mission is unable to make in literal terms, it makes by awarding Everett a large chunk of the screen time. But he isn’t a martyr, not like Chau.

We see endless self-shot footage of Chau climbing mountains, jumping into rivers, scurrying along narrow forest paths — visuals that could ostensibly project him as a ‘regular’ person. But Everett offers perhaps the film’s most sobering observation, when he warns that Chau’s reckless actions might inspire others to make similar illegal incursions into forbidden territory. It’s a dangerous proposition, and as one person keenly notes, none of this takes into consideration what the Sentinelese might want.

Gary Oldman says he was ‘mediocre’ in the Harry Potter movies: ‘If I had read the books…’,"Oldman had starred as Sirius Black in The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix and The Deathly Hallows Part 2.","Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman says he is not a fan of his performance as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise. During his appearance on the latest episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast, the British actor said his portrayal of the fan-favourite character was “mediocre”.
“I think my work is mediocre in it. No, I do. Maybe if I had read the books like Alan (Rickman, who played Severus Snape), if I had got ahead of the curve, if I had known what’s coming, I honestly think I would have played it differently,” Oldman said.
The Harry Potter movies were adapted from author JK Rowling’s book series of the same title. The franchise titles are The Philosopher’s Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows – Part 1 & 2.

“I’ll tell you what it is. It’s like anything, I think if I sat and watched myself in something and said, ‘My God, I’m amazing,’ that would be a very sad day, because you want to make the next thing better,” Oldman said.

“It’s so subjective. It’s such a personal thing that you’re looking at that other people are not seeing… It’s not to disrespect someone who says to me, ‘Oh, I really love you in that movie,’ and I’m thinking, ‘I’m terrible in that movie. What are they talking about?’ It’s not that. It’s (that) they’re seeing something else,” he added.

Recently, Gary Oldman had revealed that being part of popular franchises Harry Potter and Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy “saved” him as a single father.
In Nolan’s movies, which featured Christian Bale as superhero The Batman, Oldman had essayed the role of Commissioner Gordon.
“At 42 years old, I woke up, you know, sort of divorced and I had custody of these boys. That, in itself, was … that was hard because there was a shift in the industry where a lot of productions were… in Hungary, Budapest, Prague, Australia, you know, all of these places. So, I turned down a lot of work.

Recalling Shah Rukh Khan’s reaction, Vikram said, “Behind the camera, Shah Rukh sir was standing, and he couldn’t control his laughter.

Devil movie review: Kalyan Ram film lacks punch,Devil review: Kalyan Ram is sincere in a film lacking originality or depth. Devil is strictly for fans of the actor.,"The success of last year’s Bimbisara still augurs well for Kalyan Ram, despite the poor show of his Amigos earlier this year. The choice of a British-era story has worked well in creating interest in this film. Samyuktha also lends support here. Pushing all these factors is producer Abhishek Nama, who raked up controversy by removing director Navin Medaram from the movie and declaring himself the chief architect of the film. Has the gamble worked? Let’s see.
Devil is all about spies, double agents working for the British or the Indian National Army headed by Subhash Chandra Bose. It is all taking place at the time when Bose is contemplating returning to India, and the British are working hard to catch him. The central stage of this drama is Rasapadu, a coastal town in Madras Presidency, with a British secret agent named Devil (Kalyan Ram) running a bigger operation pretending to solve the murder of a Zamindar’s daughter. Playing other characters of interest are Samyuktha, Vashistha Simha, Satya, Shafi, Ester, Ajay and Malavika Nair.

Vikram said that another actor from Punjab was with them on set, but there was some miscommunication between him and Hirani. “What he had done in his audition, he wasn’t able to translate on set. We were all a little nervous. You are affected when you are working with someone big. So, just the thought that you are in the first shot of a Rajkumar Hirani film, which is being made after so many years, so you are bound to get nervous. It’s a big responsibility that you have.

"Javed Akhtar wrote iconic Jagjit Singh ghazal in 9 minutes, says inspiration behind ‘Ek Ladki Ko Dekha’ was ‘terror’",Javed Akhtar recalled how he wrote the now-famous 1942 A Love Story song 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga'.,"Javed Akhtar has written some of the most popular Hindi film songs of all time, and in a recent interview, the veteran writer recalled the circumstances in which he wrote the romantic song ‘Ek Ladki Ko Dekha’ from 1942: A Love Story. Picturised on Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala, the song is often described as one of the most romantic Hindi film songs of the 1990s, but for Javed, the source of inspiration for this song was ‘terror’.
Talking to Red FM India, Javed said that he was the one who suggested to director Vidhu Vinod Chopra that the scene in question demanded a song, but as soon as he walked out of that meeting, he forgot about it. He shared, “I suggested that there could be a good song here. He said, ‘No, it’s not the right place. The boy and girl have not even met yet. He has only seen a glimpse of her and he doesn’t even know that she lives here, he is still looking for her, where will we fit a song here? And anyway there is a romantic song in a while so what’s the point of a song here?'” But since Javed insisted, Vinod asked him to write a song and present it four days later.

"Salaar, Rocky and Agastya: The angry young Amitabh Bachchans in Prashanth Neel-verse","For KGF and Salaar director Prashanth Neel, Amitabh Bachchan serves as an inspiration when crafting male leads, particularly drawing from the grey roles of Bollywood's Shahenshah.","From Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor to Kamal Haasan, Naseeruddin Shah and Irrfan Khan, Indian cinema has consistently had extraordinary male actors who, along with their female counterparts, significantly impacted and moulded visual art, while in/directly enabling writers and directors to push boundaries, resulting in the creation of more intricate works.
Although these actors have mutually inspired each other and subsequent generations of talent, leaving a lasting impact on viewers as well, the influence of Amitabh Bachchan in the realm of Indian cinema remains unmatched. Beyond creating shockwaves with his remarkable acting skills and versatility, effortlessly portraying a range of emotions and drama while excelling in action and dance sequences, Big B redefined stardom in India, earning admirers nationwide, transcending language barriers. The characters tailored specifically for him to fit the ‘angry young man’ archetype, left a profound mark on various film industries across India, paving the way for regional endeavours to replicate similar movies, catapulting local stars to greater heights. Yet, no one could replicate what Bachchan achieved.

Telugu Cinema in 2023: The five best movies and the five biggest letdowns,"Last year, Telugu Cinema produced RRR, Sita Ramam, Ante Sundaraniki, Virata Parvam and Masooda. Looking back at it at the end of 2023, the cinematic heights of last year feel Olympian in comparison.","With a couple of exceptions, picking the best films in a year like this becomes a matter of one’s preferences among the almost-theres. This is a year defined by various strands emerging from within Telugu cinema complicating any reductive reading—indie dramas rooted in rural Telangana broke through with Balagam and Pareshan, mass films attempted to be more experimental with form— Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire and Dasara, even big star-vehicles like Bhagwant Kesari and Waltair Veerayya were forced to take the hero down a peg in order to keep the genre relevant.
The most interesting facet was the return of the romance—the success of films like Sita Ramam last year and Hi Nanna this year perhaps indicates a resurgence in the popular consciousness of a genre that acknowledges something beyond male fantasies and anxieties, a tendency which has defined and circumscribed popular Telugu cinema for too long. A film like Miss Shetty Mister Polishetty stood out precisely because it managed to center an independent woman who refuses to be circumscribed by patriarchy. There was also Nandini Reddy’s Anni Manchi Sakunamule, which featured a woman working to solve her family’s financial troubles as its protagonist. 2023 also saw the debut of a female filmmaker (woefully underrepresented in Telugu cinema)—Puja Kolluru, with Martin Luther King, a remake of the Tamil film Mandela (2021).

Was 2023 a tipping point for Hollywood movies? Barbie success and Marvel struggles may signal a shift,"For the first time in more than two decades, the top three movies at the box office didn’t include one sequel or remake: Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Oppenheimer. The last time that happened was 2001, when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Shrek and Monsters, Inc. topped the box office.","Eight years ago, Steven Spielberg predicted that the superhero movie would one day go “the way of the Western”.
Spielberg’s comments caused a widespread stir at the time. Avengers: The Age of Ultron was then one of the year’s biggest movies. The following year would bring Captain America: Civil War, Deadpool and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The superhero movie was in high gear, and showing no signs of slowing down.
But Spielberg’s point was that nothing is forever in the movie business. These cycles, Spielberg said, “have a finite time in popular culture.” And the maker of E.T., Jurassic Park and Jaws might know a thing or two about the ebbs and flows of pop-culture taste.

As 2023 draws to a close, no one is sounding the death knell of the superhero movie. The Walt Disney Co.’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 made $845.6 million worldwide and Sony’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($691 million) was one of the most acclaimed films of the year. Marvel is still mightier than any other brand in the business.
But more than ever before, there are chinks in the armor of the superhero movie. Its dominance in popular culture is no longer quite so assured. A cycle may be turning, and a new one dawning.

For the first time in more than two decades, the top three movies at the box office didn’t include one sequel or remake: Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Oppenheimer. The last time that happened was 2001, when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Shrek and Monsters, Inc. topped the box office.
No, it’s not exactly a lineup of originality like, say, 1973, when The Exorcist, The Sting and American Graffiti led all movies in ticket sales. Barbie and The Super Mario Bros., based on some of the most familiar brands in the world, will generate spinoffs and sequels of their own.

But it’s hard not to sense a shift in moviegoing, one that might have reverberations for years to come for Hollywood.
“There’s an inflection point in 2023,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “Barbenheimer is just one part of that story. Audiences, they want to be challenged. I think the tried and true is not necessarily working.”
Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, from Warner Bros., was the year’s runaway hit, with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales worldwide. It was a blockbuster like none seen before: an anarchic comedy that set a string of records for a movie directed by a woman.
Nearly as unprecedented was the success of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, a three-hour drama that nearly grossed $1 billion. As different as it and Barbie were, they were each original feats of cinema and personal statements by its directors.

At the same time, the Walt Disney Co.’s Marvel, a hit-making machine like none other in movie history, faltered like never before. The Marvels marked a new low for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, collecting $200 million globally. DC Studios, in the midst of a revamp, saw disappointing results for The Flash and Blue Beetle before watching Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom sink to a $28.1 million debut.
Both Marvel and DC have already made moves to right their ships. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called turning around Marvel his top priority. He said the superhero studio has suffered greatly from too many films and series leading to “diluted quality”. The James Gunn, Peter Safran-led DC, meanwhile, won’t officially launch until 2025 with Superman Legacy.
In the meantime, something else will have to fill the void. That was a theme in 2023, too, when the writers and actors strikes marred release plans and forced the delay of several films including Warner’s Dune: Part Two, Sony’s next Ghostbusters movie and MGM’s Challengers.
Those disruptions will continue in 2024. Analysts aren’t expecting a banner year for Hollywood in part because films like the next Mission: Impossible film and the Spider-Verse sequel, both delayed by the strikes, won’t make their original dates.

Overall ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters for 2023 are expected to reach about $9 billion, according to Comscore, an improvement of about 20% from 2022. The industry is still trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing, when ticket sales regularly surpassed $11 billion. Output of wide-releases in 2023 (88) still trailed those in 2019 (108) by 18.5%.
Hollywood is still coaxing moviegoers back to theaters — something Barbie, Oppenheimer and Mario went a long way to helping.
“It reinforced something that we’ve known for 100 years in the business: People like going to the shared experience out of the home,” says Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. “They love being entertained. Movies are a good financial proposition and can bring in a mass audience.”
“It probably started with Mario last April,” adds Goldstein. “I think that showed audiences again that theaters are a fun place to be to. And it showed studios and content creators: Up your game.”

If 2023 is any guide, hits will come from increasingly unpredictable places.
That was the case with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, a film released just two months after Swift’s recorded concerts in a first-of-its-kind distribution deal with AMC Theatres. It grossed $250 million worldwide, and was followed by the similarly released Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, another No. 1 debut.
More surprising was Sound of Freedom, a $15 million film from the independent Angel Studios, which matched Swift with $250 million worldwide. It was released with a unique “pay it forward” program that allowed people to donate tickets.
Going into 2023, no one was betting Sound of Freedom would outgross The Marvels or that Five Nights at Freddy’s would have a bigger opening weekend than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There are going to be examples of big-budget, traditional blockbusters that do well,” says Dergarabedian. “But for every one of those, there have been two that failed. An audience that’s finding a lot of interesting material on streaming is becoming more open to films like Godzilla Minus One, Indian cinema, Japanese anime. There’s a shift in audience taste and studios need to get a handle on this.”
That poses as much of a challenge as an opportunity to studios. If more-of-the-same no longer has quite the same appeal for moviegoers, an industry that for years has depended on sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes to make up the bulk of its profits may require new creativity.
The Western didn’t vanish all at once. After two decades of ubiquity, it began going out of style in the 1960s. And the Western, of course, continues to be rich territory for filmmakers. This year, 81-year-old Martin Scorsese made his first Western in Killers of the Flower Moon, the three-hour-plus $200 million epic from Apple Studios.
The superhero movie, likewise, won’t ever die. But its heyday might have reached its endgame.

Vijayakanth: The man with a golden heart,Vijayakanth was a people's person. His speeches and deeds stand evidence to it.,"“Andha vinnukum mannukum samandham undunu sonnathu yaar? Adhu mannavan paeru (Who proved there is a bond between heaven and the earth? It’s our king.” Perhaps, this line from Chinna Gounder, in the voice and composition of Ilaiyaraaja, is the song playing in the heads of many across Tamil Nadu today. Actor Ilavarasu, a frequent collaborator of Vijayakanth, while mourning the death of the star, made a valid observation that how irrespective of his success and failures in politics, Vijayakanth remained someone who was never hated by the masses. Almost all celebrities of Tamil Nadu have invariably noted how the actor was a people’s champion and helped the downtrodden.
To describe the mindset of Vijayakanth, a viral video of his speech at a public meeting, would help. In the clip, Captain says, “What is everyone going to do with crores and crores of rupees? Won’t you all feed me, my wife, and my sons? Won’t there be a small space for me and my family? Isn’t that enough? If I start spending one day at every one of your homes, I can live through life. What is then money? Even when we are burnt, they take off the arunakodi (a thread tied in the hip in people down South). Am I going to take all of it when I go?”

Hain Tayyar Hum: Congress’ slogan was once a Laxmikant-Pyarelal song in Amitabh Bachchan-Rajinikanth film,"Composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal and written by Anand Bakshi, Hum song 'Hain Tayyar Hum' was sung by Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan, Mohammad Aziz, Sudesh Bhosle and Sonali Vajpayee. Congress has announced it as its poll slogan.","When Hindi film fans heard the slogan chosen by Congress for its campaign for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, they couldn’t help but sing it in a melody. ‘Hain Tayyar Hum’, the slogan chosen by the Congress is reminiscent of the song of the same name from the 1991 film Hum. Congress held a mega rally dubbed ‘Hain Tayyar Hum’ in Nagpur on Thursday, the party’s 139th foundation day.
Starring Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth and Govinda in lead roles, Hum was directed by Mukul Anand. ‘Hain Tayyar Hum’ was the title song of the film and was used as a family song in the film with the characters standing up united in the face of adversity. The film also starred Kimi Katkar, Deepa Sahi, Shilpa Shirodkar, Danny Denzongpa, Anupam Kher and Kader Khan, and was one of the most successful films of the year.

"Dunki actor on success of films like Animal, Pushpa: ‘Masses are angry, frustrated, filled with rage’","Dunki actor Vikram Kochhar spoke about the success of violent action movies this year, and said that audiences these days are filled with rage that they don't know how to exercise.","Dunki actor Vikram Kochhar spoke about the the film’s box office clash against Prabhas’ Salaar, and said that art isn’t something that should be pitted against itself. He also spoke about the rise in male-driven action films, a genre that has dominated Indian theatres this year, with films such as Pathaan, Jawan, Gadar 2, Leo, Jailer and most recently, Animal, delivering huge numbers.
In an interview with Bollywood Now, the actor speculated that the masses in India are angry, frustrated, and vengeful, which is perhaps why they are turning to this kind of cinema over more sensitive stories. “There are a lot of action-thrillers that are working these days, and a lot of people want to watch them. But this also depends on the political scenario of a given time. Look at how many wars are going on around the world. People are frustrated, angry, hateful, these feelings are prevalent. Everybody has vengeance in their heart, but they don’t think about where this will take them,” he said.

Did you know a case was filed against Vijayakanth for his moniker Captain?,"A case was filed against Vijayakanth for using the title 'Captain', by an ex-army man in 2014.","‘Captain’ is among many other titles like ‘Puratchi Kalaingar’ that have gone viral on social media after the demise of actor-politician Vijayakanth. While other names like Karuppu MGR and Sokka Thangam do justice to the actor, nothing comes close to Captain. It was accepted not only by his fans but the masses, who never found a reason to hate him. However, a case was filed against Vijayakanth for using the moniker as it is a title given only to soldiers in Indian armed forces.

"‘Shah Rukh Khan gives every cue himself, double sometimes fills in for Akshay Kumar’: Dunki actor Vikram Kochhar highlights differences between two stars","Actor Vikram Kochhar, who has worked with Shah Rukh Khan in Dunki and Akshay Kumar in Kesari, spoke about the differences in the two actors' working styles.","Actor Vikram Kochhar, who recently appeared in Shah Rukh Khan‘s Dunki, spoke about how different the experience was as compared to working with Akshay Kumar on the film Kesari. In Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani, Vikram played the character Balinder ‘Buggu’ Lakhanpal, who is a part of the core group of friends of Shah Rukh’s character Hardy.
In an interview with Home Bollywud, Vikram praised Shah Rukh dedication to his projects, and said that he is completely devoted to his scripts and loves rehearsing scenes until he knows them like the back of his hand. As an actor, he said, it was more fulfilling to work on Dunki. Asked to highlight the differences between the two sets, and to confirm if the reports about Akshay preferring to work early in the morning are true, he said, “Discipline is something that is maintained on every set, and entire teams of people are responsible to maintain the discipline. There isn’t much of a different in terms of working style. They give their shots when they have to, they give cues when they have to. Yes, it’s true that Shah Rukh gives his own cues. It’s not like that with Akshay sir. Sometimes he gives cues himself, but other times, his double fills in.”

She also spoke about SRK’s working style and mentioned that he would rehearse every scene to the point that it becomes a part of his muscle memory.
“Just like Bachchan sir, Shah Rukh sir loves to rehearse. He likes to rehearse a scene to the point that he is one with the dialogue and it becomes a part of his muscle memory. He is a theatre actor who became a film actor. So his way is more like going about rehearsing. And he is a trained actor also so our methods are quite opposite,” she told Connect FM Canada.

Saif cleared a couple of misconceptions about himself on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, on which he was joined by his mother, Sharmila Tagore. On the episode, Saif also narrated an anecdote about his son, Taimur.
He said that Taimur has developed an interest in Christianity, after being introduced to the religion by Kareena Kapoor. But since Kareena doesn’t answer his questions, the responsibility has fallen on Saif. “He keeps asking me questions about God. And I have to figure out how to answer them properly. He was asking something about the crucifixion, and how Jesus died, and why he was killed. It needs a proper answer.” Karan joked, “Thank God he isn’t asking Bebo that, because I don’t want her to give him wrong information, which she’s capable of…”

"Dunki box office collection Day 7: Shah Rukh Khan-starrer crosses Rs 300 crore mark worldwide today, SRK’s combined 2023 total hits Rs 2500 crore","Dunki box office collection Day 7: After making the most of the Christmas holiday period, Shah Rukh Khan's latest film has witnessed a consistent decline. The film has surpassed Rs 150 crore mark in India and will pass the Rs 300 crore mark worldwide today.","Despite facing stiff competition from the Prabhas-starrer Salaar, Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki has maintained a steady pace at the box office. However, after making the most of its first weekend and the Christmas holiday period, Dunki has witnessed a consistent decline in revenue. According to early estimates by industry tracker Sacnilk, Dunki is expected to earn Rs 9.75 crore on Wednesday, marking the film’s lowest single-day haul. This will bring the film’s total domestic collection to Rs 151.26 crore.
On Wednesday, Dunki had an overall 19.89 percent Hindi occupancy. After seven days, Dunki accumulated Rs 305 crore in worldwide gross box office, as shared by Red Chillies Entertainment on X (formerly Twitter).

"Salaar box office collection day 6: Prabhas-starrer crosses lifetime collection of Adipurush, punches past Rs 500 crore mark worldwide","Salaar box office collection day 6: Starring Prabhas in the lead role, Salaar has emerged as the actor's biggest hit since his Baahubali films. The film has already surpassed the collection of Radhe Shyam and Adipurush.","Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire, starring Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran in the lead roles, had a historic start at the Indian box office. The film made Rs 90.7 crore nett on its opening day in India, but even after such a massive start, the film’s collections have seen a steady drop in subsequent days. The long weekend over the Christmas holidays helped the film’s box office numbers. After collecting Rs 24.9 crore on Tuesday, the film earned Rs 17 crore on Wednesday, its sixth day of release. This takes Salaar’s nett domestic collection to Rs 297.40 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.
This seems like a win for Prabhas, whose previous film, the much-hyped Adipurush, could only manage to make Rs 288.15 crore nett in India through the course of its run. Adipurush ran into controversy soon after its release and was criticised for its visual effects and dialogues. His 2022 film Radhe Shyam, earned only Rs 104.38 crore nett during its run. Salaar will cross the lifetime collection of Prabhas’ 2019 film, Saaho, on its seventh day. Saaho made Rs 310.60 crore through its run. His biggest hit to date is SS Rajamouli’s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, which made Rs 1030.42 crore nett in India and grossed Rs 1788.06 crore globally.

Ricky Gervais Armageddon review: Provocative comedian dusts off dated material in latest Netflix standup special,"Ricky Gervais Armageddon review: The British comedian certainly isn't breaking new ground with his latest Netflix standup special, but his penchant for provocation remains as cheeky as ever.","Is it even a joke if you have to explain it? But that’s what Ricky Gervais repeatedly does in his new Netflix special, Armageddon. Essentially a cover version of his greatest hits, the hourlong special finds the comedian taking particular delight in essentially committing an act of onstage arson. Gervais tackles everything from dying babies to dwarf actors, from China to chimpanzees. “You’ll realise this is great satire when I’m dead,” he says at the end of a particularly hilarious bit about ordering a pair of track bottoms off Amazon.
His recurring schtick in Armageddon is to keep telling the audience that he’s still workshopping the material, implying that some of the jokes haven’t yet been perfected. It’s all a part of the act, of course, even the extended break-downs. The bigger question is, why? Why, after all these years, does Gervais feel the need to underline every point that he is making? The simplest answer is that, in his attempt to spell things out, he is satirising his audience’s dwindling appetite for risqué humour.

From Mammootty to Darshana Rajendran: 11 Malayalam actors who shined in unconventional roles this year,"2023 saw many Malayalam actors pushing the limits and embracing roles considered unconventional. From Mammootty and Joju George to Darshana Rajendran and Aju Varghese, the list is not short.","Despite the challenges faced by Malayalam cinema in 2023, especially in terms of business, where nearly 90 per cent of films reportedly struggled to eke out a profit in theatres, it would be unfair to label the year as entirely negative for the industry. The presence of a few highly memorable films, showcasing exceptional narratives and featuring outstanding performances, provided audiences and the industry with some respite.
Moreover, 2023 also saw many actors pushing the limits and embracing roles considered unconventional — from Mammootty and Joju George to Darshana Rajendran and Aju Varghese, the list of actors who excelled in out-of-the-box performances is not short.

"Govind Namdev revisits ‘traumatic’ experience of working with Subhash Ghai in Saudagar, director removed him from the film after shooting",Govind Namdev said that he had a 'traumatic time' after working with Subhash Ghai. He implied that he 'blacklisted' the director.,"Subhash Ghai’s 1991 film Saudagar was considered the biggest casting coup at the time as it starred Dilip Kumar and Raaj Kumar for the first and only time. Ghai took the credit for bringing the stars together as they were rumoured to be on not-such-great terms off-screen. However, while Ghai scored big with the audience for bringing the actors together, Govind Namdev, who was also a part of the film, felt that he was shortchanged here. In a recent interview, Govind said that it was a “traumatic time” for him as Ghai shot with him but later removed his character from the film altogether.
“That was a traumatic time for me,” Govind told Lehren Retro. “When I got the role, it was quite big and then he later chopped off the entire role in the final edit. By then, I had already told the entire world that I was working with Dilip Kumar, Raaj Kumar, Subhash Ghai. These are big personalities. I had told everybody about it. The shoot was also done,” he shared.

"Vijay Sethupathi says he was ‘afraid’ of talking to Katrina Kaif while filming for Merry Christmas: ‘I’m new to this industry, she is a big star’",Vijay Sethupathi said he was intimidated by Katrina Kaif's stardom when they filmed for Sriram Raghavan's Merry Christmas.,"Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif will soon be seen together in Sriram Raghavan’s Merry Christmas. In a recent promotional interview for the movie, Katrina revealed that Vijay did not speak to her much during the filming. She said that after talking to Varun Dhawan, who has worked with Sriram in Badlapur, she came to the conclusion that maybe the director had instructed him to not speak with her but Vijay had another story to tell. The Farzi actor said that he didn’t speak to the Tiger 3 star because he was intimidated by her.
Katrina shared that Vijay is “very philosophical and he is very very wise” and added that “he is not a big conversationalist, at least on the film.” The actor then shared that she really liked working in the film but found it strange that people were not talking to her on set. “I came to know later that Sriram sir possibly told people that they should not talk too much to me on set. Varun Dhawan told this to me. He was asking, ‘What’s it like working with Sriram sir?’ I said, ‘He is amazing, his world is amazing but nobody talks too much to me on set.’ I was really questioning myself. He said, ‘Don’t worry, he has told everyone not to talk to you.’ I don’t know if that’s true,” she shared while talking to Pinkvilla.

56 French stars defend Gerard Depardieu despite sexual misconduct allegations,"Gerard Depardieu was handed preliminary rape and sexual assault charges in 2020 following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould, and has been accused by more than a dozen other women of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting them.","More than 50 French performers, writers and producers published an essay Tuesday defending film star and national icon Gerard Depardieu amid growing scrutiny of his behavior toward women during his five-decade career. Advocates for sexual abuse victims expressed dismay at the outpouring of support.
Depardieu was handed preliminary rape and sexual assault charges in 2020 following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould, and has been accused by more than a dozen other women of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting them. Depardieu denies wrongdoing, and called the essay ‘”beautiful”.
Published Tuesday in the conservative-leaning Le Figaro, it was signed by figures including former first lady and singer Carla Bruni, Depardieu’s former partner Carole Bousquet, and actors Pierre Richard, Charlotte Rampling and Victoria Abril. Two dozen of the 56 signatories were women. Many are from Depardieu’s generation; he is 74.
ADVERTISEMENT
A recent documentary outlined accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women against Gerard Depardieu, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea. The France-2 documentary prompted calls by some to stop airing Depardieu’s films, which include classics of modern French cinema.
In response, Tuesday’s essay says: “We cannot remain silent in the face of the lynching targeting him, the torrent of hate being dumped on his personality.
“When Gerard Depardieu is targeted this way, it is the art (of cinema) that is being attacked,’’ it said. “France owes him so much. … Depriving ourselves of this immense actor would be a drama, a defeat. The death of the art. Our art.’’
Paris lawmaker and feminist Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu said the signatories are experiencing a ‘’denial of reality”.’ She said she would have preferred for them to support initiatives against sexual violence instead.
ADVERTISEMENT
“They are refusing to see what this man did … because he is an artist,″ she told broadcaster France-Info.
Emmanuelle Dancourt, whose #MeTooMedia group supports sexual misconduct victims in the media industry, said on BFM television that the essay’s message is particularly painful for victims of sexual abuse by powerful men.
French President Emmanuel Macron also drew ire when he said last week that Gerard Depardieu ’’makes France proud”.
The recent documentary includes a segment where Depardieu is heard making crude sexual comments about a young girl riding a horse.

"’12th Fail is the biggest hit of the year, in terms of ROI’: Abhishek Bachchan breaks down movie distribution business","Starring Vikrant Massey and directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 12th Fail grossed nearly Rs 70 crore worldwide, emerging as the year's biggest sleeper hit.","Actor Abhishek Bachchan said that he isn’t one to complain when films do well at the box office, because ultimately, that’s what the industry needs. But, he said, on a purely mathematic level, the biggest hit of the year wasn’t Jawan or Pathaan, but probably director Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s sleeper hit, 12th Fail. Abhishek was participating in a roundtable discussion with 12th Fail actor Vikrant Massey, where they were both asked about the resurgence of Bollywood in 2023, which has been fronted by a slew of hyper-masculine ‘films.
The biggest Hindi-language hits of the year are Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan and Jawan, the Sunny Deol-starrer Gadar 2, and Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal. But 12th Fail quietly ended up making nearly Rs 70 crore worldwide, despite being released in a fraction of the screens as some of the bigger films. Abhishek took the opportunity to explain how the business functions, and said that the marketplace isn’t conducive for smaller films, which are often held to the same standards as the big blockbusters.

"When Salman Khan recalled his struggle after Maine Pyar Kiya’s success: ‘I had no work, a devta-saman aadmi entered my life’",Do you know Salman Khan's salary for his 1st Bollywood film? Find it out here.,"One of the most successful stars that Hindi film industry has seen, Salman Khan is a brand in himself today. As the actor, fondly called Bhai by his fans, is celebrating his 58th birthday today. However, Salman’s initial days in the film industry were not smooth despite being writer Salim Khan’s son. Earlier this year, Salman Khan reflected on his struggle before finding success in the film industry.
Speaking at a recent press conference before the release of his film Tiger 3, he had shared, “People say that we will put in all the work after we get the film. All these things, I have done much before I came into the industry. The four-five years of struggle that I had before I came into the industry, before I did films like Maine Pyar Kiya and Biwi Ho To Aisi. After that also, whenever I sign a movie, I have to like it in the first narration. If I like a film, I shift that film before my other projects. And the projects that I have postponed, they will likely not happen. Until that time, I won’t sign another film. That is what I usually concentrate on.”

Chatting with iDreamMedia, Pranay said that the criticism against Animal has mostly come from the English-speaking critics in Mumbai, while the Telugu media has been mostly lenient. “There’s a gang forming,” he said, “They want to bring him down.” Asked why anybody would want that, Pranay added, “First thing is, he’s a South Indian guy coming to Mumbai, dictating terms there.” Absolving Bhushan Kumar and T-Series of any suspicion, Pranay continued, “These English-speaking critics are far from reality. They should travel from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in a second-class coach to see what people are going through… Can’t do much.”

Asked why it took him so long to collaborate with Hirani, Shah Rukh said in the interview, “Actually, we’re very old friends. When he started his career as a director – he was an editor – he wrote a film called Munna Bhai MBBS. I still remember, I was shooting a scene for Devdas, in which I was going to pass away. And this gentleman came and said, ‘I have a script’. And I said, ‘Okay, let’s meet day after tomorrow, I’m doing this film next’. He said, ‘You haven’t heard it’. I said, ‘I love the title, it’s a fantastic title, Munna Bhai MBBS’.  We were supposed to do that film, we sat on it for six-seven months. But I had a sudden injury, I had a spine surgery, and they didn’t know when I would recover.”

She said in Hindi, “I am a 90-year-old woman. I got married, had three kids. I’d take the kids to my mother’s house when things became difficult in my marriage, but I never filed for divorce. But nowadays, every month I hear about divorces. Why is this happening?” Ravi Shankar joked that older generations had her music to turn to in difficult times.

In his 35-year career as an actor, Salman has led over a hundred films, most of which have turned out to be box office successes. One of the troika of Bollywood’s Khans, Salman has ridden epic crests and touched deep troughs but managed to retain a massive fanbase. However, the last few years have been lacklustre for Salman with films failing at the box office and the touchstone of public acclaim. While the films’ report card has not blemished the actor’s starpower, is it time for reinvention for Salman Khan?
Today, on Salman Khan’s birthday, we speak to filmmakers and industry experts to understand what is that people expect from the star and how he can reinvent himself a la Shah Rukh Khan circa 2023.

"Kho Gaye Hum Kahan: Ananya Panday is the best thing about the Netflix movie, so why does Bollywood insist on miscasting her?","Post Credits Scene: For some reason, Bollywood films have largely avoided telling stories about urban millennials. And for that reason alone, Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, is a bit of a path-breaker.","It’s a strange scene, but Ananya Panday saves it. Strange because, unlike the rest of the film (which is surprisingly sombre and not averse to simmering in sadness), this scene unfolds like a farce — complete with an over-the-top tone, garish set dressing, and broad humour. And it becomes Panday’s responsibility to to rein it in. The movie in question, of course, is Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, a coming-of-age drama that will make everybody with a fast-depleting Cult Fit membership feel seen. But we’ll get to that later.
First, Panday. The young actor is often cited as the foremost example of blatant nepotism — the sort of nepotism that makes a certain section of the audience raise their pitchforks and orchestrate boycotts on social media. She isn’t, for instance, slotted alongside Babil Khan, despite being being considerably captivating on screen. In Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, she’s often jostling for space alongside the equally talented Siddhant Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav, but your attention invariably ends up being drawn to her.

In a chat with Pinkvilla, Pranay said that after passing out of his film school in Australia, when Sandeep returned to Hyderabad, he thought he “would crack it easily” but it did not happen that way. “He thought he would crack it easily after coming from Australia but that wasn’t happening because of the way he was narrating the story. I don’t know… It was beyond the belief system of the producers, the way he was narrating,” Pranay told Pinkvilla.

The film presents Ranbir Kapoor’s character Ranvijay as an alpha male. Bajpayee said what a film represents depends entirely on a director’s ‘gaze’ and the message of a film doesn’t matter if the film is not ‘engaging’. But he also clarified that he won’t ever play a character that doesn’t match his conditioning as a human being.
During a recent chat with Zoom, Bajpayee, while answering a question about balancing the layers of a male character in a movie, said, “The film that has instigated this debate about masculinity has a director who believes completely differently. That’s his gaze. Joram is another gaze, which is directed by Devashish Makhija and we are in complete agreement with him. His interpretation is that the man doesn’t have a voice and the woman is making decisions for him. When that woman goes away from his life, he becomes voiceless.”

He said, “My closet from the industry is Janhvi Kapoor, I think JK has part timer as my therapist, my advisor, my teacher, my guru, my life coach, my cheerleader, my support system, etc etc she has always been the real deal to me. Says it how it is and says it with love. There was a time 3 years ago, I hit a very dark rock bottom in my life, and I kid you not, this girl has sat with me on the phone (we were in different countries) and baby sat me for days, weeks, months. Between sets, between meals, between sleep. I would have been so traumatised if I was her, but she is such a strong girl, the life raft of my life. I would not be where I am, or even how happy I am if JK did not have my back, back then and today. I may sound like a suck up/a fan/or even a minion, but idgaf credit where credit is due dude. There has not been a moment I have been conscious, scared, embarrassed to share any detail of my life with her, no matter how low or humiliating it could be.”

"Kohraa, Jubilee, Trial by Fire: As web series trumped films in 2023, Shubhra Gupta picks the year’s best","The best web-series trumped the best movies of the year in the way they were backed by solid, layered, meaningful writing, with proper character arcs and motivations built in.","Looking back at 2023, OTT-wise, it’s clear that in the most crucial manner, the best web series trumped the best movies of the year in the way they were backed by solid, layered, meaningful writing, with proper character arcs and motivations built in.
Kohraa
Just look at ‘Kohraa’, by far my top show of this year. A brilliant collaboration by Sudeep Sharma, Randeep Jha, Diggi Sisodia and Gunjit Chopra, it used a murder as a peg to hang a compelling character-study in a very specific time and place. The five-part series opens with a body in a fog-laden field in a Punjab village : the discovery leads to seemingly disparate people connected by dark secrets, with a parallel thread of drugs and mobsters. In a great ensemble cast – Suvinder Vicky, Barun Sobti, Manish Chaudhary, Varun Badola, Harleen Sethi, Rachel Shelly– the former towers over the rest.

As the year draws to a close, we pick the movies that we consider the best of 2023.","Malayalam cinema kicked off 2023 in style with the highly acclaimed Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam, directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, hitting the screens on January 19.

"Dunki is Rajkumar Hirani’s darkest film, but it’s also his driest and dated","Dunki's biggest strength until its release is also now its biggest flaw- Rajkumar Hirani. The faults in his filmmaking were never more apparent, even if the ambition was also never so grand.","What can be the worst moment in a film? A classroom full of characters laughing their hearts out over a joke which is only funny to them. The echo of their laughter gets no response from the audience. Dunki has that moment– and then some more. You know what the joke is setting out to be, but the punch doesn’t land. You are aware of the drama that is unfolding, but it never tugs. You have seen how high Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani can rise yet are merely settling while watching Dunki, a 2 hour 40-minute heartbreak of a collaboration.
Till about last year, all the year-ender listicles had placed Dunki right in the top 3 of the most anticipated Bollywood films, and rightly so, for it was the fruition of two-decade long attempt to unite Rajkumar Hirani, one of the biggest mainstream Indian directors, and Shah Rukh Khan, in his golden phase. Four days after Dunki, there is a silent disappointment that is ringing through. The film will eventually sink, and there are some valid reasons for this.

"Twinkle Khanna on feeling like a ‘ball of gas’ in song with Shah Rukh Khan: ‘I was starving, survived only on channa’",Twinkle Khanna opened up about how she was starving to fit into catsuits for a song with Shah Rukh Khan in Baadshah.,"Actor turned actor Twinkle Khanna took a trip down the memory lane and opened up about why she felt like a ‘ball of gas’ while filming a song with Shah Rukh Khan for the film Baadshah. The song in question was Mohabbat Ho Gayee in Badshah. Twinkle, who was seen wearing body-hugging outfits, revealed that she was basically starving and surviving on channa (roasted gram) to fit into the outfits.
In a conversation with Shrayana Bhattacharya, Twinkle said, “I know you see all these actresses saying that they don’t diet and they eat everything; it’s not true, most of them are starving. I was starving, if you want your stomach to be flat in all those catsuits that we used to wear—I don’t know why we wore them. This was my own brainwave that I’m going to live on channa. For some reason, being Gujarati, I felt that was also cheap, and you know, I could get it easily wherever I went.”

"Ghajini 15 years on: Aamir Khan’s film, which became Hindi cinema’s first Rs 100-crore earner, is a hard pass","Aamir Khan's Ghajini, which released in 2008 on Christmas, feels archaic. Had it been an 80s film, when masala-actioners, with morally uncorrupted superbeing heroes taking on demonic villains singlehandedly, defined Hindi cinema, I would have still given it a pass.","Ghajini is a violent film that puts your mind, ears and all other senses to test. Here, a business tycoon meets a small-time model, falls in love with her, gets hit on the head with a rod, witnesses her murder helplessly and avenges it despite suffering from short-term memory loss.
Led by Aamir Khan, the film by A. R. Murugadoss also features hammers, water taps, iron rods, ‘ketchup’ blood and an unpleasant, contrived and artificial plot. Of course, everyone loved it 15 years ago when it was released on Christmas day in 2008. Otherwise, how would you justify it becoming the first Hindi movie to earn Rs 100 crore in the domestic market, thus introducing the ‘coveted’ Rs 100 crore club to judge a film’s worth? Perhaps, even hinting to budding filmmakers that gory violence, a couple of songs, thumping action-sequences, one sweet love story, and an avenging protagonist would promise a victory at the box office.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga says ‘too much wokeness in Mumbai’: ‘Don’t know why they are so sensitive towards films’,Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga spoke about his film receiving flak from critics and how films shouldn't be perceived as a temple of learning. He also criticised the growing hypersensitivity and wokeness in Mumbai and across the country.,"Ever since the release of his film Animal, filmmaker and writer Sandeep Reddy Vanga has often complained about critics and how they have been unfair to his latest blockbuster. In a recent interview, the filmmaker reiterate the same point, emphasizing that films are not a temple of learning and criticised the growing hypersensitivity and wokeness in Mumbai and across the country.
In response to trade analyst Komal Nahta’s question about the perception that Animal could influence people negatively, Sandeep said, “You are right, a film is not a temple of learning. When they don’t learn in school or from there parents then how will a film teach them? I forgot this and thought that maybe it’s okay to judge a film, but this statement reminded me that it’s wrong. There is a saying that, ‘if one says a lie many times, it appears to be the truth’ that is what is happening in Mumbai and the whole country. There is too much wokeness. People are getting hyper sensitive. I don’t know why they are so sensitive towards films, they don’t have this reaction in any other department.”

Zakhm turns 25: Why this 90s film on Mahesh Bhatt’s mother should be an inspiration for today’s filmmakers,"Set against the backdrop of the 1992-93 Bombay riots, Zakhm draws inspiration from the life of Mahesh Bhatt's mother, Shirin Mohammad Ali. Despite its historical context, the film addresses various subjects that remain relevant even today.","“The 90s’ called, they want their films back,” is my lingering sentiment as I reflect on the Hindi film landscape of 2023. This year witnessed an onslaught of chest-thumping, ostensibly patriotic films that not only dominated the box office but also transported us back in time. One of these releases was a literal sequel to a 90s hit film, devoid of any contemporary essence. Despite the cinematic offerings of 2023 harking back to the 90s, my recent revisit to Mahesh Bhatt’s 1998 film, Zakhm, compelled me to reconsider my stance. This 90s film wasn’t just ahead of its time; it served as a reminder that good films are timeless.
Zakhm draws inspiration from the life of Mahesh Bhatt’s mother, Shirin Mohammad Ali, who spent her life yearning for public acknowledgment of her relationship with filmmaker Nanabhai Bhatt. Despite having six children with Shirin, Nanabhai never married her due to their differing religions, subjecting Shirin and her children, including Mahesh Bhatt, to societal judgment. Pooja Bhatt, Mahesh Bhatt’s daughter, portrays the character of Noor in the film, inspired by her grandmother’s challenging life.

"Men in Black, Field of Dreams star Mike Nussbaum dies at 99",Mike Nussbaum was acknowledged by the Actor's Equity Association union multiple times in the past several years as the oldest professional actor in the country.,"Mike Nussbaum, reputed as the oldest professional actor in America with a prolific stage career and roles in films including Field of Dreams and Men in Black, has died. He was 99.
He died of old age at his Chicago home on Saturday, just days before his 100th birthday, his daughter, Karen Nussbaum, told The Associated Press.
“He was a good father and a good man who raised us to care about other people and respect other people and care about justice,” she said.

Mike Nussbaum was acknowledged by the Actor’s Equity Association union multiple times in the past several years as the oldest professional actor in the country.
When asked about his status as a working nonagenarian over the years, Nussbaum said he simply enjoyed the work.
“I am gifted and lucky to still be able to do the thing that is the most fun for me in life,” he told WBEZ Chicago in 2019 when he was 94 years old. “As long as I can do it, I will.”
Born in December 1923 in Chicago’s Albany Park neighbourhood, Nussbaum first acted in summer camps. He didn’t pursue acting full-time until he was in his 40s, working for a time as an exterminator. He received his Equity card in the 1970s.

Nussbaum spent more than 50 years on stages in the Chicago area, including at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. He played Shylock in a 2005 production of The Merchant of Venice and Gremio in The Taming of the Shrew, among many other roles.
In 1984, he won a Drama Desk Award for his performance in David Mamet’s Glengarry Glen Ross, which won a Pulitzer Prize the same year. Nussbaum worked with Mamet often over the years.

Nussbaum performed into his 90s, including a 2017 role as Albert Einstein in the play Relativity at Northlight Theatre in suburban Skokie, where he also served briefly as artistic director.
“His genius was that you couldn’t tell he was acting,” said BJ Jones, a longtime friend and colleague who is current artistic director at Northlight. “His level of truth was unparalleled. You never saw him sweat. He wasn’t trying to draw attention to himself. ” Though he was primarily a stage actor, his film credits included a school principal in Field of Dreams and in Men in Black as Gentle Rosenberg, whose head opens during a pivotal scene to reveal a small alien creature.

"Prithviraj Sukumaran defends violence in Salaar, Animal: ‘We should have the liberty of making what we want to’","Prithviraj Sukumaran, though hasn't watched Animal, said that a filmmaker should have the liberty to show violence for his narrative.","One common element in most of the recent films — from John Woo’s Silent Night to Prashanth Neel’s Salaar–is the explicit violence, blood, and deaths. Earlier, Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal faced criticism for being too graphic when it comes to fight sequences, and now, Prabhas-Prithviraj starrer Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire is receiving similar reaction. When asked about the violence, Prithviraj Sukumaran, who has played a lead role in the film, defended it as a creative choice.
ALSO READ | Salaar Movie Review: Prabhas’ violence-riddled film is all noise, meaning very little
In an interview with News18, the Malayalam star, who is also a film director, said that if a filmmaker wants to shoot graphic violence for his story, he should have the liberty to do so. He pointed out that every film is certified by the Central Board of Film Certification and the body decides who can watch the film. “Our responsibility as a filmmaker is to make sure that we submit it to the Censor Board. How we make the film should be left to us,” he said.
He stated, “The audience has already been told about a film’s certification because it has violence or nudity. Censorship should happen in the exhibition sector to keep a tab on who goes to the theatre and who gets to see it. As an artist, I’ve always believed that we should have the liberty of making what we want to. Who sees the material should be regulated as it is.” Defending Salaar’s violent scenes, Prithviraj said that the film won’t be the same with violence. “The violence in Salaar is very much a character in the plot and it’s a screenplay instrument to further the drama. Without the violence, Salaar won’t be what it is.”
Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, directed by Prashanth Neel, is set in a fictional kingdom named Khansaar. Prithviraj has played the role of Vardha Mannar, one of the governors of the city, who wants to become its king. When a coup is staged to overthrow him, Vardha seeks help from his old friend Deva (Prabhas). The film, which is loosely based on Prashanth Neel’s Ugramm, has collected more than Rs 200 crore at the domestic box office in a matter of four days. Other than Prabhas and Prithviraj, the film also has Shruti Haasan, Jagapati Babu, and Bobby Simha in important roles.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/prithviraj-sukumaran-defends-violence-in-salaar-animal-prabhas-film-wont-be-what-it-is-without-violence-9081727/,entertainment

On her eviction Aishwarya said, “I wanted to win the trophy, but I got eliminated for breaking rules, so I am very disappointed. It was a very unfair decision from Isha.

She has just gotten very overconfident.”

When prompted to respond to a tweet suggesting that he seek psychiatric help, Sandeep replied, “He (the person who tweeted)  needs to go to the psychiatrist. Because he needs to understand that this is not what I am doing in real life, this is cinema, this is art, this is expression. I will make a few scenes uncomfortable, that’s the quality of the film, that’s the quality of art. It will upset you, it will provoke you, it will irritate you.

Vanga recently commented on critics, drawing parallels with what happened after the release of his previous film, Kabir Singh. According to him, many critics lack knowledge and education about film craft, often overlooking aspects like editing and sound design in their reviews. In an interview with Connect FM Canada, he said, “In a way, I understood their mental status and their IQ. If morality comes into the picture, then you can’t make this film. If everybody is going to focus just on the morality, we should stop making films. Let’s just make cartoons.”

"Dibakar Banerjee says he can’t make Khosla Ka Ghosla today, finds the film to be ‘very patriarchal’: ‘All female characters are helpers’","Dibakar Banerjee can no longer 'relate' to his National Award-winning film Khosla Ka Ghosla. In his opinion, the film is 'very patriarchal'.","Dibakar Banerjee’s directorial Khosla Ka Ghosla was released in 2006, three years after being shot. The film, starring Anupam Kher, Boman Irani, Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, Parvin Dabas, Tara Sharma and others, attained a cult status over the years and is counted among one of the best satirical comedies. But Banerjee can no longer “relate” to the film and the only emotion that he feels about it is “nostalgia”. In his opinion, the film is “very patriarchal”.
Banerjee recently appeared on the latest episode of Unfiltered by Samdish where he said that he won’t be able to make a Khosla Ka Ghosla today. Expressing his opinion about the film, Banerjee said, “Khosla Ka Ghosla is a very patriarchal film. I can’t make a film as patriarchal as that anymore. It will feel like a lie.” The filmmaker feels that he was able to make it back in the day because, “At the age of 35-36, you are in guilt, you don’t even know what you are saying, you are just making a patriarchal film.”

He will say ‘I will do it, I’ll just come.’ And he will go (Shah Rukh), and will not come back. What does star system mean is that I am a star, and I have a scene with you. I am doing it, I am doing the scene with you. But I know that ‘150 crores’ is sitting here’. The star has this awareness, totally, in every scene. So, I mean you can see all the stars do this. Now I feel a little boredom in that.”

"Do Rajkumar Hirani’s films still hold up? 3 Idiots, Sanju aren’t the evergreen films they were once considered to be",Rajkumar Hirani has a hundred percent on his report card when it comes to box office successes but does that make his films evergreen?,"Rajkumar Hirani is one of those rare Indian filmmakers who has never had a flop in his career. Box office hits, which don’t necessarily speak about a film’s quality or longevity, however, have nothing to do with a film’s success, and here, Rajkumar Hirani does not have a 100 percent hit rate. Hirani started making movies in 2003 and his first film Munna Bhai MBBS was a crowd-pleaser. He subsequently turned it into a franchise with Lage Raho Munna Bhai and then moved on to making films like 3 Idiots, PK, and Sanju. Over the two decades that Hirani has been making movies, he has established a certain style for himself that hasn’t evolved much. People crack jokes in emotional situations and the extras in the scene end up in tears with smiles on their faces, the characters give out life lessons but in a Sadhguru-like way where they can sound new age-y and turn it into a catchphrase for the film’s marketing, and the jokes here are as massy as the ones that appear in Kapil Sharma’s shows.
Let’s talk about his last release Sanju, a biopic on actor Sanjay Dutt’s life, where Hirani whitewashed Sanjay’s image to the point where it was anyone else’s fault but Sanjay’s for the way his life turned out. Sanju was like a PR exercise to clean up Sanjay Dutt’s image in front of the masses who, by the way, are still not inclined to buy tickets for a film that is solely led by him. The entire film had a ‘bechara’ vibe going for him that left you wondering if this was indeed the life story of a man born with a silver spoon who chose to throw his life away many times, but was awarded multiple chances every time he reached the cusp. The idea that the media was to be blamed for Sanjay’s problems was simply bizarre but this became the grand conclusion of Hirani’s film. Sure, Ranbir got a chance to flex his acting muscles but making a hagiography for a man who is still working in the public eye was an odd choice by Hirani, that made for an odd film that isn’t the kind that will end up in anyone’s list of favourites.

Shah Rukh Khan says Jawan and Pathaan were not ‘mass cinema’: ‘We analyse films a lot’,Shah Rukh Khan was all praise for Dunki director Rajkumar Hirani and opened up about working with him.,"Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani’s film Dunki, featuring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role, hit theaters on Thursday. After the success of SRK’s Jawan and Pathaan earlier this year, there’s curiosity about whether Dunki, which is not billed as a mass entertainer, can capture the audience’s attention similar to his previous two films.
Opening up about the same, Shah Rukh said, “I feel we kind of analyse films a lot. We keep talking too much about mass oriented and content oriented. I think films are entertainment oriented. In any which way they make us feel good, entertain us, whatever their topic is. I don’t think Jawan or Pathaan were mass cinema, they were just entertaining films. I hope they were entertaining.”

"Shah Rukh Khan says he was ‘age-honest’ for the first time in Dunki, calls Vikram Rathore from Jawan ‘over the top old person’",Dunki actor Shah Rukh Khan said that people don't want to give him older roles because he looks young.,"Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dunki was released in theatres on Thursday to a mixed response. Shah Rukh, who plays the role of Hardy in the film, has opened up about how he has been ‘age-honest’ for the first time in the Rajkumar Hirani directorial. SRK also said that he is comfortable playing his own age and also made a comparison to his role in Jawan.
The actor said, “I am 58 now and I feel I should do age-centric roles now. Jawan was more like a commercial, ‘in-your-face’ kind of character. I won’t call it a caricature, but it was an over the top old person. In this (Dunki), he is very real. And to be a certain age and span that many years is very interesting. I would say I have been ‘age honest’ for the first time in Dunki. It’s more close to my age. And I think I have tried to play it as real as possible. It’s not a conscious effort, but I am comfortable playing my age and others. Since I look young, people don’t want to give me older roles.”

Rebel Moon movie review: Zack Snyder’s spectacularly dull sci-fi epic is the worst film of his career,"Rebel Moon movie review: Despite echoes of Lagaan and India's colonial past, director Zack Snyder's legions of local fans might struggle to find positives about his ghastly new Netflix film.","Whatever the tonnage of the cash-laden trucks that Netflix presumably backed into Anthony Hopkins’ garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull Rebel Moon at the last moment, it wasn’t enough. The recent Oscar winner has seen it all in his day — he once played a Transformers historian, for Optimus Prime’s sake — but you’d be hard pressed to find a project in which he was as underutilised as he is in director Zack Snyder’s latest eye-sore.
Hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device, in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary ‘hello’, but with, “You’re the legendary assassin known only by the name of Nemesis. Assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail, all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children.” What?

The song might grow on the audience but the initial impact left by Deepika and Hrithik is simply unmissable. It also makes you wonder why no one ever cast Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone in the same film even though they have been contemporaries for over a decade and a half.

Curry and Cyanide movie review: Netflix’s dissatisfying true crime documentary inelegantly exhumes Jolly Joseph serial killings case,"Curry and Cyanide movie review: Superficial and salacious, Netflix's documentary about the Jolly Joseph case doesn't deviate from the true crime template.","Director Christo Tomy takes a sensationalist approach to what could have been a been a complex story of infighting among family members, lasting resentments, and cruel betrayals, in Curry & Cyanide – The Jolly Joseph Story, the rare Netflix true crime film that could have benefited from the streamer’s typical three-episode structure. As it stands, Curry & Cyanide comes across as a sleazy slasher movie masquerading as an exhaustively researched account of horrific crimes.

In 2019, a middle-aged woman named Jolly Joseph was arrested on suspicion of killing them with cyanide. Her husband, Roy, fell unconscious in the bathroom, while the infant daughter of a man she had her eye on was said to have choked on food some years later. Some years after that, that man’s wife died at a dentist’s office, while Jolly’s uncle and in-laws were all declared dead after having collapsed without warning. She was present on each occasion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/curry-and-cyanide-movie-review-netflix-dissatisfying-true-crime-documentary-inelegantly-exhumes-jolly-joseph-serial-killings-case-9075913/,entertainment
"Salaar Movie Review: Prabhas’ violence-riddled film is all noise, meaning very little","Salaar Part 1 Ceasefire Movie Review: Till the violence in Prabhas-Prithviraj-starrer is comic-book and ‘Games Of Thrones’-type stylised, you can find a way to rationalise it; the trouble ratchets up when it becomes more ‘real’.","Salaar Movie Review: It’s tempting to dub ‘Salaar Part One’ ‘KGF’ Redux, except it is bigger and bloodier. It is bathed in the same colour palette — shades of black limned with red. It has the same appetite for violence, with a higher body count. And instead of one hero, it has two, Prabhas and Prithviraj, playing childhood best friends whose primary job as able-bodied adults is to cleave through flesh, and lop off heads: let it not be said that Prashanth Neel doesn’t have a taste for blood. No, let it not.
Let it also not be said that Neel doesn’t have the gift for world-building. The fictional ‘Khansaar’, an outpost somewhere in India which doesn’t follow any rules except its own, is impressive. It is ruled by a king (Jagapathi Babu) who has clawed his way to the throne after having decimated challenges from the two rival tribes that have lived there for ‘a thousand years’: the figure is used in the film enough times to give it a proper little epical ring.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/salaar-movie-review-prabhas-prithviraj-sukumaran-prashanth-neel-violence-all-noise-meaning-very-little-9078704/,entertainment
"Sandeep Reddy Vanga opens up about Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna’s inter-caste marriage in Animal, ‘reckless negligence’ of kiss","Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga spoke about the inter-caste relationship at the centre of the film, and said that it wasn't a conscious political choice.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga claimed that it wasn’t a conscious decision to show inter-caste relationships in each of his three movies – the Telugu-language hit Arjun Reddy, its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, and the recent blockbuster Animal. In an interview, the provocative filmmaker also spoke about the rebellious kiss that Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandanna’s characters share as an act of defiance against their families in Animal.
Speaking to Galatta Plus, Vanga was asked about his fascination with inter-caste relationships, and he said that it wasn’t deliberate. “I see a lot of Telugu and Tamil families settled in Delhi. Maybe I like seeing inter-region and inter-caste marriage…” Asked about the kiss, and the way it has been staged in the film with a rock song in the background, Vanga said, “There’s a recklessness in the rock. You feel like they’re voicing out their rage. There’s a bit of negligence also in that,” he said.

"Shah Rukh Khan shares details about his next film, says he will play a ‘more age real’ role",Shah Rukh Khan is yet to announce his next film after Dunki. But he shared that he will be playing a 'more age real' role in his next.,"Shah Rukh Khan took a five year-hiatus from movies after 2018 but 2023 will always be remembered by SRK fans as a year when King Khan made a comeback and how! Through these years, Shah Rukh Khan worked on three films – Pathaan, Jawan and Dunki – which have all released this year and SRK is yet to announce his next film. Now, the star has dropped a hint about his next film and shared that he will start shooting for it by March-April.
In a chat with Raya Abirached, Shah Rukh shared that he will be taking up a role that is “more age real” to him but he will still be the star of the film. When asked about his next film, he said, “I think I will start one in March-April now. Like I have been attempting now to do a film which is more age real to me and play it still as the protagonist and the star of the film.”

The bash was attended by high-profile film industry personalities such as Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan as well. At the party, Shah Rukh gave a speech in honour of Pandit, and called the producer his ‘spiritual guru’.
In a video from the party, Shah Rukh can be seen on the stage, standing next to Pandit and singer Sonu Nigam. In his speech, he said that he wakes up at midnight like an ‘ullu (owl)’ and goes on drives around Juhu with Pandit. He joked that Pandit owns so much real estate in the neighbourhood that it’s easier for him to point out the buildings he doesn’t own as opposed to the ones that he does.

Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga says Ranvijay forbid Geetanjali from remarrying because he didn’t want his ‘kids to see her with another man’,Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga spoke about the complaints that have been raised by people he described as 'pseudo-feminists' regarding a scene in the film.,"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who recently delivered the third successive box office hit of his career with Animal, spoke about a particularly controversial scene from the movie, which has contributed to the perception of it being misogynistic. Despite its global gross exceeding Rs 850 crore, Animal has been criticised for its glorification of toxic masculinity and for Vanga’s apparent disregard for his films’ morality.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, he was asked about the scene in which the lead character Ranvijay, played by Ranbir Kapoor, instructs his wife Geetanjali, played by Rashmika Mandanna, to not remarry in the event of his death. He said, “In relationships, most of the time, you’re done. Multiple partners could be a habit. Once you’re with one person, the share of love with that one person, you are done for life. That could be the exchange between Geetanjali and Ranvijay. And knowing the psyche of Geetanjali, there are so many things in a relationship that are unsaid, so he must have felt that she can’t make it with anybody else, so she’d better remain single.”

2018 director Jude Anthany Joseph apologises after film fails to crack Oscars shortlist: ‘A dream-like journey’,2018 director Jude Anthany Joseph has reacted to the film not making it to the Oscars shortlist in the Best International Feature category.,"Director Jude Anthany Joseph took to social media to express his disappointment after his film, the Malayalam-language blockbuster 2018, failed to make it to the Oscars shortlist in the Best International Feature category. In an Instagram message, Joseph shared a screenshot of the 15 shortlisted films, and apologised to his well-wishers and fans of the movie.
Released earlier this year, 2018 is a disaster drama focusing on the Kerala floods of the same year. The film starred a host of well-known figures from the Malayalam-language film industry, such as Tovino Thomas, Kunchako Boban, Lal, and others, and grossed more than Rs 200 crore worldwide, emerging as the biggest Malayalam-language hit of all time. Some would wonder why 2018, a mainstream blockbuster, was chosen to compete in the highly coveted category in the first place.

"Salaar box office collection day 1 early report: Prabhas set to deliver biggest opening of 2023, over Rs 175 crore global gross on the cards","Salaar box office early reports Day 1: Prabhas' action-thriller is all set to deliver one of the biggest openings of the year, and has an outside chance of doing better than his recent flop, Adipurush.","Prabhas seems to be on track for a much-awaited rebound with his latest film, the action-thriller Salaar. Directed by Prashanth Neel, the pan-India film is facing off at the box office against Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki, which it is handily outpacing. While Dunki debuted to around Rs 30 crore on opening day, Salaar has already earned over Rs 135 crore in advance sales for day one, which happens to be today.
According to Homable Films, the production company backing Salaar, the film sold 30.5 lakh tickets in advance with the collection of Rs 95 crore coming from the pre-booking of tickets. By 7 pm on Friday, the film managed to gross Rs 135 crore in India and earned Rs 175 crore gross globally.

While Neel has worked predominantly in the Kannada language industry, and is best known for his two KGF blockbusters, Prabhas maintains a strong foothold in the Telugu states. Unlike the performance of the recent hit Animal, which seemed to generate interest both in the Hindi belt thanks to star Ranbir Kapoor and in the Telugu regions thanks to director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Salaar is clearly attracting audiences on the strength of Prabhas’ stardom.
Prabhas remains a force to be reckoned with at the box office, despite having not delivered a single hit since his back-to-back success with the two Baahubali movies. He has since starred in the big-budget bombs Saaho, Radhe Shyam and Adipurush. He will next be seen in the dystopian thriller Kalki 2898 AD, which also features Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan.
Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki is going to have to battle somewhat lukewarm reviews and underwhelming box office returns if it wants to make an impact in the long run. The movie registered Shah Rukh’s lowest opening of the year, behind Jawan and Pathaan, and fell short of even director Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanju.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/salaar-box-office-collection-day-1-early-report-prabhas-prashanth-neel-film-double-dunki-opening-9078438/,entertainment

As Amitabh and Abhishek took to the stage with singer Sonu Nigam, actor Salman Khan joined them. It was a rare sight for the fans, as the Bachchans and Salman aren’t often seen together socially.
Salman Khan greeted Amitabh Bachchan with a hug, and later hugged Abhishek as well. But the internet also seemed to notice that he did not greet Sonu Nigam.

Dunki was released in theatres on Thursday, and on its opening day, the film made Rs 30 crore nett domestic, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. This makes it the year’s seventh-biggest opener after Jawan, Animal, Pathaan, Tiger 3, Gadar 2 and Adipurush. While Jawan opened with Rs 75 crore, even the historic flop Adipurush managed to make Rs 36 crore on its opening day.
The opening day figures make it the least successful Shah Rukh film of the year, but the opening is still bigger than those delivered by Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan (Rs 15.81 crore), Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar (Rs 15.73 crore), Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rs 11.1 crore) and Dream Girl 2 (Rs 10.69 crore).

"Malayalam hit 2018 knocked out of Oscars race, Academy announces shortlists in multiple categories; see here",The Indian Malayalam-language hit 2018 didn't make it to the shortlist for this year's Academy Awards.,"The Barbie power ballad “I’m Just Ken” and AP and Frontline’s documentary 20 Days in Mariupol just got one step closer to an Oscar nomination. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Thursday shortlists in 10 categories, including best original song, documentary feature, international feature, original score, and crafts like hair and makeup, visual effects and sound.
Mstyslav Chernov’s 20 Days in Mariupol was shortlisted in both the documentary and international feature categories, representing Ukraine in the latter.
As expected, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon were prominently represented among the finalists in many categories, including score and sound, as was Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things also advanced in makeup, visual effects and score and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in visual effects, song and score.
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the 15 international features advancing are The Zone of Interest (United Kingdom), Trần Anh Hùng’s The Taste of Things (France), Lila Avilés’ Tótem (Mexico) and Aki Kaurismäki’s Fallen Leaves (Finland). Justine Triet’s acclaimed Anatomy of a Fall was not selected to represent France and thus was not eligible in the category. India’s disaster film 2018 was, but didn’t make it to the shortlist.
Original song contenders competing against “I’m Just Ken” include two other songs from Barbie: Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night” and Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” Only two songs from a single movie can advance to the nomination stage, however. Both “Flora and Son” and “The Color Purple” had two songs advance.
Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in a still from Barbie.
Other contenders include Sharon Van Etten for “Quiet Eyes” from Past Lives, Olivia Rodrigo for Can’t Catch Me Now, from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Jon Batiste for “It Never Went Away” from American Symphony, Lenny Kravitz for his Rustin song “Road to Freedom” and Jarvis Cocker’s “Dear Alien (Who Art In Heaven)” from Asteroid City.
Diane Warren will also get another shot at a nomination for “The Fire Inside” from Flamin’ Hot. But several expected finalists were left off, including Justin Timberlake for Trolls Band Together and Jack Black for his Super Mario Bros. Movie ballad “Peaches.” Wonka was also missing from the list.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 15 original score finalists included a number of familiar players, including John Williams (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), Ludwig Göransson (Oppenheimer), Mica Levi (The Zone of Interest) and the late Robbie Robertson for Killers of the Flower Moon. Joe Hisaishi could also be headed for his first Oscar nomination for The Boy and the Heron.
Composer Kris Bowers advanced for The Color Purple, but not for Origin, which also missed out in the song category. Past Lives, by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen, was another surprise exclusion from the score finalists.
Documentary nominees in addition to 20 Days in Mariupol include American Symphony, about Batiste, Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project, The Eternal Memory, A Still Small Voice and Four Daughters. Some were surprised at the omission of Kokomo City, about the lives of Black trans sex workers, and Little Richard: I Am Everything.
Barbie missed the cut for makeup and hairstyling, which included nominations for Beau is Afraid, Poor Things, Maestro, Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon.

Though Oppenheimer fared well in most categories, it was not among the finalists in the visual effects category. The film’s surprising omission from the list of the original 20 finalists was previously reported. The visual effects contenders are often comprised of superhero and franchise films that aren’t otherwise considered big awards players — this year that includes Zack Snyder’s poorly reviewed Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
Live action, animated and documentary shorts finalists were also announced. The live action category is a little starrier than usual, with both Pedro Almodóvar’s Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal western Strange Way of Life and Wes Anderson’s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Ben Kingsley, among the contenders.
For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.
Final nominations in all categories will be announced on Jan. 23. The 96th Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will be held on March 10, broadcasting live on ABC from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The show will begin one hour earlier than usual, at 7 p.m. ET.

Saltburn movie review: Barry Keoghan delivers jaw-dropping performance in the most provocative movie of the year,"Saltburn movie review: Director Emerald Fennell's provocative second feature comes dangerously close to demonising the downtrodden and feeling pity for the privileged, but, hey, at least it looks pretty.","If director Emerald Fennell’s breakout first feature was the #MeToo era’s most furious creative marker, her hotly-anticipated follow-up, this week’s Saltburn, is a gigantic middle finger to everybody who hailed her as a Promising Young Woman in 2020. Her filmmaking isn’t for the faint-hearted, and if Sandeep Reddy Vanga wasn’t so busy seething his own success, he’d do well to study Saltburn, easily the most provocative movie of the year.
A deliciously depraved dark comedy about class warfare, it makes the decidedly subversive choice to portray the grotesquely rich as the least insane. In a society broken beyond repair, the movie says with a smirk, only the Parasites will survive. But how palatable can empty provocation be, at the end of the day? In a movie that positively challenges you to check out, especially in that deranged final act, you can’t help but wonder what the point of it all is — generating oohs and aahs, or genuine introspection?

ADVERTISEMENT
Barry Keoghan stars as yet another of one those sociopaths that he has become so good at playing in his short career. In Saltburn, he’s Oliver Quick, a middle-class misfit who struggles to find his bearings as a first-year scholarship student in Oxford. Almost immediately, he is awestruck by the aristocratic Felix Catton, played with feline grace by the newly minted heartthrob, Jacob Elordi. Felix is naturally charismatic, the centre of attraction at every party fortunate to have him as a guest — he’s everything that the moth-like Oliver isn’t. But after a couple of chance encounters, he finds himself developing a curiosity for Oliver, and before long, they become inseparable.
When Oliver bares his heart to him one day about his mentally ill parents, who’ve struggled his entire life with drug addiction, Felix feels an instant pang of pity and invites him to spend the summer at his family’s sprawling countryside estate, Saltburn. Oliver is taken by the pomp and splendour of it all, and Felix’s family seems just as interested in him as he is in them.
Rosamund Pike and Richard E Grant play Felix’s parents, delivering performances that deliberately feel like they don’t belong together in the same movie. Pike’s Elspeth could easily be an alternate reality version of Amy from Gone Girl, if she’d never actually returned to the bamboozled Ben Affleck and had started a new life under an assumed identity. In her first interaction with Oliver, she declares that she has “a complete and utter horror of ugliness,” and doesn’t bat an eyelid before describing her squatter friend Pamela — Carey Mulligan in a colourful cameo — as “the wettest of wet blankets.” To Elspeth, people like Oliver and Pamela are mere playthings, distractions that she will cycle through like they’re seasonal fashion lines.
But forget eating the rich, Saltburn doesn’t even pause to laugh at them. Of course, Oliver’s early days at the palatial property offer plenty of opportunity for fish-out-of-water humour. But it’s made clear fairly early on that he isn’t exactly going to function as our surrogate in this strange world. If anything, it’s the Catton family that comes across as more relatable, despite their frequently objectionable behaviour. So what if they host lavish parties that could give Jay Gatsby an inferiority complex; so what if they’re openly disdainful of others? Oliver — thanks mainly to genius casting or simply because of the way he’s written — is always enigmatic and never endearing. This isn’t necessary, of course, but even Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker evoked a certain level of empathy.
ADVERTISEMENT
And this might understandably put you in an odd mood. The movie preys on the audience’s inherent decency, as it begs them to spare a thought for poor village bumpkin, only to yank the carpet out from under your feet deep in the second act. Oliver is the decoy protagonist, in many ways. The real hero of the story — the tragic hero — is Felix. And what a year Elordi is having, having balanced the harmless naïveté of his character here to the calculative villainy of his Elvis Presley, in the recent biopic Priscilla. There’s a reason why he’s being earmarked as Hollywood’s Next Big Thing.

Fennell could’ve easily made Felix a more reprehensible fellow, but Elordi plays him as a bit of a himbo. Oliver’s ulterior motives, on the other hand, are underlined as more sinister. There are moments in the film’s frankly unhinged final third that could compel some viewers to stage a walk-out — one scene in particular might be the most provocative thing put in a mainstream movie this year. As with her first film, Fennell’s politics warrant a rigorous examination — she comes dangerously close to demonising the downtrodden and feeling pity for the privileged — but her formal evolution has been satisfying to witness.

So-dam, best known to viewers for her role in Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning film Parasite and Korean dramas such as Cinderella with Four Knights and Record of Youth, said she learned a lot about India through her college friend and Squid Game star Anupam Tripathi.
“I haven’t had the chance to visit India. However, I went to school with Anupam, you may know of him, he’s an actor in Korea who came from India. We took classes together and in our downtime, we’d take walks around a lake together and I heard so much about India from him,” So-dam told PTI in a virtual international roundtable.

“Recently, I watched the variety show ‘Adventure by Accident’ where they visit India and I was amazed at the variety of different sceneries and backdrops India had, depending on where you go. So I’d really love to visit one day,” she added.
The 32-year-old actor stars as Death in Amazon Prime Video’s fantasy drama Death’s Game, which revolves around In-guk’s Choi Yi-jae. Yi-jae tries to end his life and angers Death who makes him experience the pain of death 12 more times through different incarnations. It is based on a popular webtoon.

So-dam is happy that Death’s Game is available globally.
“It makes me happy because we tell a story with many universal themes and messages that I’m sure will resonate with a lot of different people around the world. We also have a universally resonant message about life, how you should look back on it and think about how precious we all are and our day-to-day mundane lives are. I hope that the global audiences will watch the show and relate to the themes being delivered,” she added.
In-guk, who has already featured in the fantasy show Doom At Your Service, said he accepted the drama because he was already a fan of the original webtoon.
“The drama carries a very important message, and it’s one that makes me look back at my own life too. That’s what I was drawn to the most,” he added.

His attempts, he laughed, were unsuccessful because “Greta was persistent and Greta saw something,” he said.

Neru movie review: Mohanlal has started his journey back,"Neru review: It is Mohanlal’s performance, notably better than his recent lacklustre ones, that makes Neru’s 150-minute runtime feel less prolonged.","Most crime thrillers, at least in recent times, usually end on a “high” note with the previously elusive and unidentified culprit being apprehended by the infallible hero cop. But what happens to these culprits after that? Do they receive the deserved punishment? Are the victims granted timely justice? Or do these wrongdoers manipulate the system, tipping the scales in their favour, and resurface in society even more formidable?
As vital as the investigative phase is to a case, the trial holds equal, if not greater, importance as it ultimately determines the final verdict. However, observing this process unfold in a two to two-and-a-half-hour film may not be inherently engaging, which is why courtroom scenes in cinema tend to be exaggerated, sometimes even lacking coherence. Nevertheless, with his Mohanlal-starrer Neru, director Jeethu Joseph has made an attempt to navigate the realm of courtroom drama with an emphasis on accuracy yet without compromising emotional depth; but its effectiveness is somewhat questionable.

In an interview with Kairam Vaashi, the director was indirectly asked if Salaar was a remake of Ugramm. The filmmaker said, “Ugramm was made for theatres. It was made for the cinema halls and I always had that pain. Not to take away anything from KGF, the idea, the world building, it came to me from Ugramm itself.

Prabhas ‘warned’ Prithviraj about Salaar director Prashanth Neel’s obsession with hairstyles: ‘Many times he has stopped shooting for one hair’,Prashanth Neel explained why he stuck to the colour palette of KGF for Salaar. Salaar releases in theatres on November 22.,"When Salaar dropped its first teaser, fans were convinced that the film surely belonged to the KGF universe as the colour palette of the movie was the same as Yash’s KGF films. Even after the trailer came out, fans were looking for hints to prove that Rocky Bhai was going to appear in Salaar. While KGF and Salaar’s director Prashanth Neel later stated that the worlds of both these movies were far apart, he has now explained the reason for the visual similarity between these films.
In a chat with SS Rajamouli on the YouTube channel of Hombale Films, Prashanth said that he has an “OCD with monochrome”. The director said that he realised the visual similarity between KGF and Salaar only after he started sharing the content of the film with the audience. “I have an OCD with monochrome and that is somehow reflecting in my movies, which I realised only after I put out Salaar trailer and teaser. I realised that very strongly. This has nothing to do with my DOP, it has nothing to do with my art director,” he said.

Even Shah Rukh Khan’s Hardy comes off as working too hard for not enough pay-off.","Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki Movie Review: In ‘Dunki’, Shah Rukh Khan plays a soldier yet again this year after ‘Pathaan’ and ‘Jawaan’, but this third time around turns out to be unlucky: his vaunted first collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani is mostly a crashing bore.
‘Dunki maarna’ is a colloquialism for illegal migration. In the film, Hardyal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) is the catalyst which gets the Laltu threesome of Mannu (Taapsee Pannu), Buggu (Vikram Kochhar) and Balli (Anil Grover) going, through dangerous underwater and overland terrain in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, onwards to their dream destination, London.

He recalled a story narrated to him by his late father, Veeru Devgan, about the bond that directors Manoj Kumar and Raj Kapoor shared.
Asked about the changes that they’ve witnessed the industry undergo over the years, Ajay said, “I’ve heard stories from my dad. In fact, I remember a story, Manoj saab made this film Purab Aur Paschim, and he invited Raj saab for the trial of the film. In the beginning of the film, the British rule gets over, and the Indian flag goes up. As soon as the Indian flag goes up, the film changed into colour; it was black and white (before that). Raj saab got up, walked out, and Manoj saab ran after him, asking, ‘What’s wrong’. Raj saab said, ‘I hate you, I don’t want to watch this film. How could you think of this? I couldn’t think of this. Your film is a superhit, I’m not watching any more’.”

He came to Mumbai without a train ticket, was put behind bars, had no work, no food. Somebody helped him out, said that if he washes his cab, my father could sleep in it.

Zero: The most ambitious film of Shah Rukh Khan’s career is ready for a reappraisal; can everybody admit it was treated unfairly?,"Post Credits Scene: Zero, the biggest bomb of Shah Rukh Khan's career, set the stage for how Laal Singh Chaddha and The Archies were received. Indian audiences, it seems, have lost an appetite for earnestness.","Zero is a wild film that imagines a classless India in which a small town dwarf gets with a rocket scientist and a movie star, rejects them both, goes to Mars, and returns. Starring Shah Rukh Khan, the movie includes a monkey, two cancelled weddings, and irrefutable proof that Abhay Deol and R Madhavan are palatable only in small doses.  Of course everybody hated it.
If the unexpected discourse around The Archies has shown one thing, it’s this: Indian audiences, barring that one time, don’t seem to have an appetite for earnestness any more; they’re far more interested in ‘edgy’ cinema. Perhaps this is a reaction to the endless hours of crime ‘content’ that we consumed during the pandemic? Or perhaps it’s just a natural response to the collective frustration that this country is feeling. In many ways, Zero’s failure foreshadowed the response that Zoya Akhtar’s Archies was greeted to recently.

"The best Indian movies of the year, from two Mammootty masterpieces to Kanu Behl’s Agra and Aamir Bashir’s Maagh","In a year marked by the return of regressive mainstream cinema, the best Indian films smashed the patriarchy, empowered the oppressed, and spotlighted talent from across regions and languages.","Casual observers could be forgiven for believing that the entirety of Indian cinema is limited to big blockbusters, each more gung-ho than the last. While the country’s biggest male stars resorted to patriotism and violence to remain relevant this year (all at the cost of women, both in front of and behind the camera), our cinema appeared to collectively return to a past that we thought we’d outgrown. Animal, Leo, Pathaan — even the titles screamed gruff masculinity. But as popular as these films were, they hardly represent the sheer diversity of our filmmaking.
For that, we must turn to a quieter corner of the cinematic landscape. This is a more accepting, empathetic, and effectively more ambitious space. The best Indian films of 2023 don’t just represent who we are as a people right now, but also who we are capable of becoming.

Ananya, daughter of actor Chunky Pandey and Bhavana, made her screen debut with Karan Johar-backed Student of the Year 2. Her next few outings, Pati Patni Aur Woh and Khaali Peeli didn’t really elevate her as an actor among the audience, until Shakun Batra’s Gehraiyaan last year, which is where Ananya started standing on her own.

Speaking about how women initiate sex in both his films Arjun Reddy and Animal, Sandeep told Galatta Plus, “I never thought this. This is not deliberate. I didn’t deliberately put the approach. See what discussion they had in the flight, other than you know, ‘Don’t talk about my father like that. What do you mean? You know my father’s is a great father.’ With that line I wanted to show that this is a shift of discussion. Hardly they spoke about anything and now you see there’s a big argument happening. I thought that would be nice dramatic quotient.”

Sandeep Reddy Vanga reveals why he removed ‘superb’ Bobby Deol-Ranbir Kapoor kiss from Animal climax: ‘It was diluting the unzipping moment’,Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga explained why a tender moment between Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol's characters was removed from the film's climax.,"Actor Bobby Deol recently revealed that the final showdown in the blockbuster film Animal included a brief moment where his villainous character, Abrar, plants a kiss on ther film’s hero Ranvijay, played by Ranbir Kapoor. Bobby said that the scene was axed on the edit table by director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who has now given more insights into his decision, and the kiss itself.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, he said, “Yes, actually there was a kiss. Bobby will kiss Ranbir, a kiss on the cheek, and say, ‘Bhai, I didn’t even spend one day with my father’, and he’ll go back and open his zip. It was superb when we were shooting, but I felt like the kiss was diluting the zip. Why I removed it was because Bobby sir gave this expression with a smirk, and a tear falls down his cheek. I felt that was a bigger cinematic high than coming and kissing.”

Main Atal Hoon trailer: Pankaj Tripathi’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee biopic is all about his politics,Pankaj Tripathi-starrer Main Atal Hoon is directed by National Award winning filmmaker Ravi Jadhav.,"The makers of Pankaj Tripathi-starrer Main Atal Hoon,the biopic of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, dropped the film’s trailer on Wednesday. The trailer suggests that the movie is the story of Vajpayee’s political career from his early days even though the text suggests that this is the story of the ‘leader you know but the man you didn’t’.
The trailer touches upon the various chapters of recent Indian history starting from the Emergency to the Kargil war. Incidents like Ram Janmbhoomi, Pokhran, Lahore Bus Yatra are shown in the trailer but those who lived through the 1990s and 2000s would certainly be able to point out many other significant chapters that have not been covered here. Even though Pankaj Tripathi is known to be an ace performer, his choice in playing the famous political leader seem a little odd.

Neliima Azeem recalls when a three-and-a-half year old Ishaan confronted a man who was being ‘aggressive’ with her: ‘He said should I call the police?’,"Neliima Azeem recalled the time when her kids, Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, were really young but were very protective of their mother.","Neliima Azeem, who is the mother of actors Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, brought up her sons almost single-handedly and the actor-dancer is very proud of the way her kids have grown up to be confident and responsible adults. Both Shahid and Ishaan were very protective of their mother from a very young age and in a recent chat, Neliima shared an anecdote when a six-year old Shahid confronted a French man who was following his mother.
In a chat with Rashmi Uchil for the book Raising Stars, Neliima recalled the time when she was performing in Belgium. “I was performing in Belgium once and a French guy kept following me around. Shahid was all of six then. He stood up to that guy and told him, ‘Before you talk to her, you will have to deal with me. That’s my mother,'” she shared.
Neliima recalled another “aggressive” incident which was rather “unpleasant” for her and even Ishaan, who was only three-and-a-half years old at the time, had the presence of mind to threaten the person by telling them that he would call the police. She recalled, “Ishaan was equally astute. He was only 3 and a half years old when a rather unpleasant incident took place. He told the person who was getting aggressive with me, ‘I am watching you. Should I call the police?’ Both my boys have been protective of me since a very early age.”

Neliima Azeem said that she did not have the option to be a stay-at-home mom as she was a single mother and had to earn while raising her boys. “It is a matter of privilege if you can choose not to work after having kids. I never had the option of not working,” she said and added that she was “the breadwinner of the family mostly.” She shared, “Boys who are raised by working mothers generally tend to become more responsible, sensitive, and emotionally caring. They want to help out and ease the financial burden on their mother’s shoulders.”
In the past, Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter have opened up about being raised by a single mother and how it changed their outlook towards life.

Eagle trailer: Ravi Teja is a ruthless assassin with a heart of gold,"In Eagle, Ravi Teja plays the role of an assassin, who seems to be using his power of destruction for a good cause.","Ravi Teja is going through a rough patch. A lot of hope was pinned on Tiger Nageswara Rao as the movie kept with the trend of violent films. However, like many of Ravi Teja’s recent ventures, the action drama about dacoits failed to leave a mark. However, Ravi is relentless in his pursuit of a hit and he is gearing up for the release of a new film titled Eagle.
Going by the trailer, Eagle comes across as another attempt from the actor to stay relevant as he is playing the role of an assassin. Across the world, films about secret agents and assassins have become hot sellers. Ravi is taking a stab at it too.

Varshangalkku Shesham first look poster: There’s a new Dasan and Vijayan in town,"Apart from Pranav Mohanlal and Dhyan Sreenivasan, Varshangalkku Shesham also stars Nivin Pauly, Vineeth Sreenivasan, Aju Varghese, Kalyani Priyadarshan, Basil Joseph, Neeraj Madhav, Neeta Pillai, Arjun Lal, Nikhil Nair and Shaan Rahman.","Five months after officially unveiling the title and cast of his sixth directorial, actor-filmmaker Vineeth Sreenivasan has announced the completion of the production of Varshangalkku Shesham (Years Later) and released its first look poster.
The poster features Pranav Mohanlal and Dhyan Sreenivasan standing on a platform with a large cutout of veteran Tamil actor and former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MG Ramachandran (fondly referred to as MGR) behind them. They appear to be imitating MGR by reciting his dialogues, with a few kids playfully teasing them in the foreground. Meanwhile, their attire, hairstyle and overall ambiance depicted suggest that the film, either entirely or partially, is set in a bygone era and hence the title “Years Later”.
  View this post on Instagram
  A post shared by Vineeth Sreenivasan (@vineeth84)
What makes the poster even more intriguing is the fact that both Pranav and Dhyan are the sons of renowned actors Mohanlal and Sreenivasan, respectively, who took the industry by storm whenever they joined forces on-screen, with their most celebrated collaboration being in the Nadodikkattu films, portraying the characters Dasan and Vijayan.
Earlier in the day, Vineeth had shared a post announcing the conclusion of filming for Varshangalkku Shesham. “This morning, at 2 am, on Dhyan’s birthday, we finished shooting Varshangalkku Shesham. I am thankful to god that I have an army of people who are passionate about what they do. This is one film where i saw how beautiful the process of film making can be, if everyday and everything is planned meticulously. When you respect the light and when you respect nature, it gives you something precious. It gives you its magic. For me, Varshangalkku Shesham was all about realising this, yet again,” he wrote.

Sameer Wankhede, the officer in charge of investigating Aryan’s case, has now responded to the Jawan dialogue and called it “roadside”.

I don’t know anything about this movie. But if someone has targeted this towards me, then I would like to respond to it in English.” He then quoted another writer and said, “I have burnt many houses and bridges and I have danced on those burnt houses and bridges so I fear no hell so please don’t scare me.”

This weekend the audience gets to choose between Shah Rukh Khan’s comedy-drama Dunki and Prabhas’ crime-thriller Salaar. People on the internet have started to pick sides in this battle of stars. While some are done watching bloodshed in films and want to watch Dunki, others can’t take a chance of missing Salaar, which comes from brand Prashanth Neel of KGF fame. However, in this clash of big titles, film trade analysts are sure about a massive footfall at the box office during the holiday season.
Since Rajkumar Hirani helmed Dunki is a comedy-drama and belongs to a starkly different genre from Salaar, it will co-exist with the Prabhas starrer at the ticket counters. While in the northern states it will have an edge over Salaar, the southern states would be hard to conquer as not only Salaar, but Mohanlal’s Neru, is also releasing in the theatres on December 21.

Rajamouli said that he is a huge fan of Shruti Haasan’s dance and he keeps rewatching her songs on his phone and TV. Being such an ardent fan of her dance moves, Rajamouli is disappointed that Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, which features Shruti in an important role, will not have a dance number. He said, “One of the complaints that I have with Salaar is that… two songs I watch on my phone or TV are her party song from Race Gurram and Charusheela from Srimanthudu. I just love her dancing. Out in the corridor, you were saying that there are no duets in Salaar. You disappointed me (laughs). Jokes apart, people will be expecting something as the two are in the film.”

What could Netflix’s The Archies learn from the provocative Class?,"Zoya Akhtar’s Netflix-backed, coming-of-age musical somewhere loses grip of the reality and relatability that previously made Netflix’s Class such a provocative, yet memorable watch.","In the past decade or so, Zoya Akhtar, the younger of the Akhtar siblings and the daughter of famed lyricst and screenwriter Javed Akhtar has most definitively established herself as one of the most distinct voices to have emerged out of the Hindi film industry in this century. Her films have not only polarised the box-office but garnered critical acclaim. Whether she now proceeds to direct, write or just produce a film for the theatres or the digital space, one thing is for sure – she is not a force to be ignored. Over the years, one has also come to distinguish the Zoya Akhtar school of film-making — there is, of course, the ensemble cast, the lavish production values, the clinically precise gaze of the camera and as some haters love to call it, an affinity to tell stories about the lives of the urban rich in India. But beyond the surface trappings of these details. Zoya’s films have always been driven by a deeply rounded human voice that has more often than not, opted to press a point home by dealing in quieter nuances as opposed to using  a sledgehammer.
I am, unfortunately, not of the generation that grew up reading the Archie comics. The Archie universe was something that came into my life in the form of stray and frayed comic books that I often found from my father’s trunks during cleaning days. Although I spent much of my younger days immersing myself thoroughly into the Tintin and Astrix universe, the Archies was something I never really warmed up to. Until, the CBC show Riverdale, starring the inhumanly gorgeous cast of KJ Apa, Cole Sprouse, Camilla Mendes and Lili Reinhart walked into our lives. Earlier I have only heard of the perpetually hungry Jughead and the musician Archie who had the hots for the rich Veronica and the girl-next-door Betty. CBS’s Riverdale, despite an eventual deep dive into aliens and time-travel, was initially rooted in a premise that attempted to take the archetypes of these familiar characters and ground them in a modern day reality – which was oftentimes dark. Hence the announcement of The Archies, backed by Netflix and directed and helmed by Zoya Akhtar had me waiting with bated breath – ever since its announcement.

Friends role didn’t bring Matthew Perry joy or peace: George Clooney,George Clooney recalled his time with Matthew Perry back in 90s at the sets of Warner Bros.,"Hollywood star George Clooney says Matthew Perry had a hard time staying happy even after bagging one of the central characters on the long-running sitcom Friends.
Perry, who played Chandler Bing on the comedy series, died at the age of 54 on October 30 after being found unresponsive at his Pacific Palisades home here.
An autopsy report released last week said that Perry died from the “acute effects of ketamine”. The actor struggled with addiction for many years and had detailed it all in his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.

Clooney, 62, said he knew Perry since he was a teenager. “I knew Matt when he was 16 years old. We used to play paddle tennis together. He’s about 10 years younger than me. And he was a great, funny, funny, funny kid,” the actor told Deadline in an interview.
Perry always wished to be on a sitcom, added Clooney, who had appeared as a guest star with his ER colleague Noah Wyle in the 17th episode of Friends season one.
“He would say to us, I mean me, Richard Kind and Grant Heslov, ‘I just want to get on a sitcom, man. I just want to get on a regular sitcom and I would be the happiest man on earth’. And he got on probably one of the best ever. He wasn’t happy. It didn’t bring him joy or happiness or peace,” Clooney said.
Perry and Clooney tasted stardom around the same time in the early 1990s. At the time, Clooney was filming ER, while Perry was shooting for Friends at the same set of Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California.
ADVERTISEMENT
The two shows went on to become the most popular shows in American television history. Due to his struggle with addiction, Perry found it hard to go on, Clooney said.
“Watching that go on on the lot— we were at Warner Brothers, we were there right next to each other— it was hard to watch because we didn’t know what was going through him. We just knew that he wasn’t happy and I had no idea he was doing what, 12 Vicodin a day and all the stuff he talked about, all that heartbreaking stuff.”
“And it also just tells you that success and money and all those things, it doesn’t just automatically bring you happiness. You have to be happy with yourself and your life,” Clooney added. Clooney is currently promoting his upcoming directorial The Boys in the Boat.

SS Rajamouli says Baahubali was originally envisioned as a single film; Prabhas shares franchise’s impact on his life,"Baahubali became a topic yet again when Team Salaar, comprising actors Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran and director Prashanth Neel, was interviewed by filmmaker SS Rajamouli.","Though six years have passed since the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, the SS Rajamouli film remains the second-highest-grossing Indian film worldwide. The profound impact of Rajamouli’s franchise on visual art and its market persists, being recognised as the driving force behind numerous significant projects currently in development.
Meanwhile, the duology became a topic yet again at a recent event when Team Salaar, comprising actors Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran and director Prashanth Neel, was interviewed by filmmaker SS Rajamouli for the production company Hombale Films. During the discussion, Prabhas, who portrayed the lead role in Baahubali, reflected on its impact on his life, while the other two also shared insights into how the duology served as a source of inspiration for them.

“I was in Italy once, and suddenly a man came up, pointed to me, and said ‘Prabhas.’ He did not even speak English, yet he said ‘Prabhas’ and not ‘Baahubali.’ In my mind, I thought about Rajamouli. One film and that’s it,” Prabhas said, prompting Prithviraj to add, “Some films are like that. They become way more than just a film. Baahubali is like a cultural phenomenon now. It’s way bigger than just a piece of cinema, and it means a lot, especially to people inside the industry.”

When Salaar director Prashanth Neel asked Rajamouli if it was true that he initially envisioned Baahubali as one film, the filmmaker acknowledged it and said, “Initially, it was planned as one film. As the writing progressed, it kept expanding. In the beginning, we envisioned it as a three-hour movie. However, gradually, it became evident that it would be four to five hours long if we put all the pieces together.”

“Then came the idea of splitting it into two parts, which seemed crazy at the time since no one had that kind of concept, unlike now when almost all big films have a part two. So, I approached the producers, pointing out that due to the escalating budget, the only way to proceed with the movie was by splitting it into two. Prabhas was super excited, but he also insisted on leaving the decision to the producers. Once the producers gave their approval, we moved forward,” he added.
Mentioning that the interval block of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is one of his favourites of all time, Neel asked Rajamouli if he foresaw the question “Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?” becoming as significant as it did. Asserting that he didn’t expect it to gain such immense popularity, Rajamouli said, “We knew it would be a shocking, beautiful moment, but I didn’t anticipate it becoming that big. In fact, we didn’t even coin that question, right? We noticed it on social media and adopted it later for promotional purposes.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/ss-rajamouli-says-baahubali-was-originally-envisioned-as-a-single-film-prabhas-shares-franchises-impact-on-his-life-9075927/,entertainment

"Prashanth Neel on Salaar getting A certificate: ‘I was very disappointed, called Prabhas sir…’","SS Rajamouli, in a special interview with Prabhas, Prithviraj, and Prashanth Neel, asked the Salaar team their thoughts about getting an A certificate for the film.","It is a bold move from the makers of Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire to not make any compromise with their film and settle for a UA certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification. While makers of such big-budget projects would aim to bring in all sets of audiences to theatres, Hombale Films will be missing out on family audiences and kids as the film is certified for adults only. SS Rajamouli, in a special interview, asked Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj the same question.

Rajamouli asked Prashanth Neel his thoughts on Salaar getting an A certificate when Prabhas has so many children among his fans. Prashanth Neel said, “The intention was never to make a movie that is so violent that it will get an A certificate. I have seen Telugu cinema for the past 25-30 years, and sometimes I feel my actions are pale in comparison to the action it had. But they have drawn out new guidelines and the censor officers also told me this is what it is. The cuts they were asking for (to give UA ceritificate)… they asked for a lot of cuts, and I was ready for them. But there were a couple of cuts, which I didn’t want to do because I thought it wouldn’t satisfy the drama. I was very disappointed. I almost sat very quitely for 15-20 minutes in front of them.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/prashanth-neel-on-salaar-getting-a-certificate-i-was-very-disappointed-called-prabhas-sir-9075929/,entertainment

The show stars Emraan Hashmi, Mouni Roy, Naseeruddin Shah, Vijay Raaz, Shriya Saran, and Rajeev Khandelwal in pivotal roles.","From being dubbed ‘the flag bearer of nepotism‘ on his own chat show to weathering criticism for promoting star kids, Karan Johar has remained a prominent figure in the ongoing debate surrounding nepotism. The filmmaker and producer recently unveiled the teaser for his upcoming web series, titled Showtime, which delves into the same nepotism debate.
In the teaser, Emraan Hashmi portrays the ‘badshaah of Bollywood,’ emphasising that those who discuss nepotism are often the same individuals eager to become insiders in the industry. He says, “Nepotism ke mukhaute ke peeche aakhir mein har outsider insider banna chahta hai (In the end, every outsider wants to become an insider behind the facade of nepotism).” Mouni Roy takes on the role of an actor navigating various challenges, while Naseeruddin Shah appears as a savvy businessman asserting, “Cinema dhandha nahi dharam hai saadda (Cinema is not my business but my religion).” The teaser also features other actors such as Vijay Raaz, Shriya Saran, and Rajeev Khandelwal.

Producer Archana Kalpathi says Vijay’s Thalapathy 68 is neither titled Boss nor Puzzle,Rumours were making the rounds on social media that Vijay's next film is titled Boss. Another rumour claimed the movie is called Puzzle.,"Archana Kalpathi, the CEO of AGS Entertainment, is yet again finding herself in the same situation as she was in 2018.

In a recent tweet, Archana dismissed rumours about the title of her upcoming movie and asked fans to be patient.

Maestro movie review: Bradley Cooper presents a nuanced biopic of a genius,"Maestro movie review: Powered by Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan, Maestro captures the brilliance of Leonard Bernstein as well as his complicated relationship with actor Felicia Montealegre","About five years ago, actor Bradley Cooper made an impressive directorial debut with A Star is Born, which bagged multiple Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. Cooper also played its lead character of a famous country rock singer-songwriter, who is battling an alcohol and drug addiction and falls in love with an aspiring singer played by Lady Gaga. With Maestro, he repeats his magnificent feat as an actor-director as he explores the complicated relationship that music legend Leonard Bernstein (Cooper) shared with his wife, actor Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein (Carey Mulligan).
At the heart of this ambitious biopic of Bernstein, a world-famous classical conductor and composer, is the deep bond he shared with Felicia even as he had multiple affairs with men. As Bernstein describes themselves, they remained “two little ducks in a pond” through thick and thin. There is a dreamy quality to their romance, which unfolds in the Forties and is shown as a flashback, as it is captured in black-and-white. Their relationship also seems perfect in spite of his demanding career as a composer of several successful operas and Broadway musicals as well as transgressions. The cracks in their relationships appear over a period of time as Bernstein becomes a bigger celebrity, who hosts lavish parties, with people fawning over him.

He is being appreciated for his performance and showered with immense love from his fans. Vanga had thought about casting Bobby as the villain of his film right from the time he conceptualised the climax. In a new interview, the filmmaker shared why he cast Bobby in Animal and why he was introduced in the film after almost two and a half hours.
Vanga told Connect FM Canada, “Right from the beginning I had this thing in mind that the hero and the villain would remove their shirts and fight on the runway. So, when I imagined that, I wanted someone macho who is broader than Ranbir and more powerful than him. I could not think of anyone but Bobby sir.”
To play Abrar, Bobby Deol did a lot of work on himself to achieve a chiselled physique. His fitness trainer had earlier revealed that the actor dedicated four months to achieve his ripped body. The climax scene of the film had him and Ranbir fighting on the runway of a London airport, shirtless.

During the interview, Vanga revealed that he kept the viewers waiting for the villain even 2 hours into the film because he didn’t want a ‘routine’ entry of his villain. He shared, “Everybody knew from the teaser and trailer that Bobby Deol is the villain and I knew they were going to wait for him. So, from the beginning, right after 15 minutes into the film, you know there is a tension about the villain but we do not see his face.”
The filmmaker continued, “Even after the interval, I thought I can open him but I thought it is a very routine way to open the villain in a film. So, I made the audience wait for almost 28-30 minutes and then I introduced him as a bridegroom. I always wanted to show that Ranbir is in a very down phase whereas the villain is having fun and getting married for the third time. I wanted to show the difference and it worked.”

Even Kabir Singh, even Animal, even me as a person… I always feel my production company’s name is Bhadrakali Productions, I don’t know why people feel I disrespect (women).

In an interview with Connect FM Canada, Vanga said that he isn’t bothered by the criticism because it’s not being done ‘in the right way’. He said that certain detractors are focusing on one or two points, and not viewing the film in totality. “In a way, I understood their mental status and their IQ… If morality comes into the picture, then you can’t make this film,” he said. Animal has been panned for its depiction of toxic masculinity.

The movie should pass Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2 (Rs 525 crore) on the all-time chart today, and will then set its sights on passing Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan (Rs 543 crore).
Animal opened to huge numbers, and has since made nearly Rs 850 crore globally, which puts it on the number three spot for Indian movies this year, behind Pathaan and Jawan. Both those blockbusters grossed over Rs 1000 crore in their theatrical runs, a number that looks out of reach for Animal, considering the dual competition it’ll face this week. Shah Rukh’s third film of the year, Dunki, will debut on Thursday, followed by Prabhas’ Salaar on Friday.

"Por Thozhil to Jigarthanda DoubleX: The best Tamil films of 2023, in the year of Leo and Jailer","While there were commercial juggernauts like Jailer and Leo, Tamil cinema offered a lot more quality films this year like Maaveeran, Jigarthanda DoubleX, and Good Night.","Unlike last year, the box office hits didn’t end up becoming the critics’ favourites this time around. Vijay’s Varisu and Leo, and Rajinikanth’s Jailer might have broken records when it came to collections, but these films are unlikely to make it to ‘best of’ lists this year. Though they were good entertainers, Tamil cinema did offer more than just two-and-a-half hours of escapism. While quality films were sporadic, there were gems like the long-delayed Koozhangal and the devastating Chittha. In no particular order, here’s a list of Tamil films that impressed in 2023.

Por Thozhil
ADVERTISEMENT
This will be a part of almost all the top ten lists of 2023, as the film effortlessly won the hearts of Tamil audiences and critics. The buddy cop-thriller explored all the tropes of the sub-genre and still managed to stay fresh. The film, which follows a novice police officer (Ashok Slevan) and a veteran (Sarathkumar) who are on the trail of a serial killer in Trichy, features gripping moments and effective twists. Director Vignesh Raja manages to deliver the message subtly and without compromising the craft. 
Jigarthanda DoubleX
Karthik Subbaraj’s return to the silver screen with Jigarthanda DoubleX has restored his position as one of the most promising filmmakers of Tamil cinema. Inspired by Spaghetti Westerns, Kartik has formed a genre of his own, which he calls ‘Pandya Western’. Despite several twists in the film, it remains captivating thanks to the excellent execution and superlative performances by SJ Suryah and Raghava Lawrence. 
Viduthalai Part 1
ADVERTISEMENT
Vetrimaaran’s Viduthalai Part 1 is a gut-wrenching tale about a remote tribal village that suffers as a police camp is set up to hunt an alleged terrorist Vaathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi). The story unravels from the perspective of a newly-appointed constable, who is not able to choose what’s right in the grand scheme of things. An anti-establishment film — a rare breed in the current political scenario in India — Viduthalai is about the oppressed and the oppressor. Never an easy watch, it makes for essential viewing.
Good Night
2022 had Thiruchitrambalam proving that a blockbuster doesn’t always need to have an action hero, huge budget and over-the-top action sequences. Good Night, directed by Vinayak Chandrasekaran, might not be as successful as Dhanush’s romantic drama, but it managed to become a brilliant box-office success story. The story of a protagonist suffering from a snoring issue that puts his marriage in jeopardy was as intriguing as it was enjoyable. With brilliant performances from Manikandan and Meetha Raghunath, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran proved that there’s more to Tamil cinema than just ‘superstars’. 
Dada
ADVERTISEMENT
Like Good Night, Dada is another small film that emerged as a winner this year. A moving tale about a single alcoholic father taking care of his son and redeeming himself was well-executed by director Ganesh K Babu. With superlative performances by Kavin and Aparna Das, the film can be accused of being bit contrived, but it manages to win you over with its emotional quotient.
Maamannan
Maamannan might not be the best film of Mari Selvaraj, but the Vadivelu and Udhaynidhi Stalin starrer deserves a place on the list. A tale of the titular hero, an MLA from an underprivileged caste, is perhaps the first film to explore the caste politics that exists inside an anti-caste party. Fahad Faasil, Udhaynidhi and Vadivelu together made this film work despite the screenplay taking an easy way out towards the end. Vadivelu as a Dalit politician stands out in an optimistic tale where good once again wins over evil against all odds.
Maaveeran
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps the most ambitious film of the year in terms of idea, Maaveeran gave Tamil cinema its original superhero. A voice in the head of a coward cartoonist Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan) makes him into a superhero. The voice foretells things, which makes Sathya an invincible fighter as he can guess the next move of his enemies. Maaveeran is fun and thought-proving at the same time, like director Madonne Ashwin’s last film Mandela.
Chittha
Easily the most haunting and difficult movie to watch this year, director SU Arun Kumar’s Chittha is about victims of pedophilia and the recourse one should take. It removes our focus from punishing the monsters and directs it towards the wounded. Siddharth has given it all to this devastating story, and it is by far the most sensitive mainstream movie about the least-explored subject. The film follows the story of an uncle and his niece. When the latter goes missing, the uncle wages war against the world to bring her back. The film has the incredible pace of a gripping thriller and the heart of a brilliant emotional drama.     
Ponniyin Selvan 2
ADVERTISEMENT
Mani Ratnam deviated majorly from the source material in the second part of his magnum opus, which worked in favour of the film. While the conclusion to the epic story had a lot of shortcomings such as the fragmented screenplay and the information overload, one has to cut some slack for the director’s vision and refusal to churn out one ‘mass moment’ after the other. PS 1 and PS 2 might not be perfect films, but they lay a strong foundation for future literary adaptations in Tamil.
Koozhangal
Though the film finished its festival run and became the first Tamil film to win the top prize at the Rotterdam Film Festival, it was released to the public only this year. Directed by PS Vinothraj, Koozhangal is an indie film about the long walk of an angry man in search of his wife, as he is accompanied by his tormented son. The film would open a lot of doors to anyone who hasn’t had a taste of world cinema. Koozhangal would go down in history as not just the best film of 2023 but of Tamil cinema of all time.

"Salaar director Prashanth Neel defends Prabhas’ stardom despite recent flops: ‘Stars have always been stars, can have one flop or 20 flops’",Prashant Neel is looking forward to the release of his pan-Indian film Salaar starring Prabhas.,"Filmmaker Prashanth Neel says movies like his KGF franchise that organically travel across the country do well, a phenomenon he hopes is repeated with his latest directorial Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Neel and Yash, the lead star of KGF series, rose to national prominence after the success of KGF: Chapter 1, the 2018 Kannada period action film. Its 2022 follow-up, KGF: Chapter 2 also starred Bollywood actors Raveena Tandon and Sanjay Dutt in key roles.
The director, who made his debut with 2014’s Ugramm, said he never plans his films as pan-India projects.
“I’ve written a story and I’ve executed it. I don’t know if it (‘Salaar’) is going to be a pan-India movie or not. But if it becomes a pan-India movie, then that’s an absolute bonus for all of us. Like, ‘KGF’ happened very organically.
“Movies that happen organically always do well. You can’t plan to make a pan-India movie, you can’t plan and say that I’m going to bring these actors from this industry to make it a pan-India movie. It doesn’t work like that,” Neel told PTI in an interview here.

Salaar revolves around two friends Deva and Vardha, played by Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, who end up becoming arch rivals. It will be released on Friday.
The 43-year-old director said the journey of the film started over 15 years ago.
“It was an idea that was in my head. But it needed a very big budget. So, I made my first film ‘Ugramm’, then I made ‘KGF’. I was occupied with ‘KGF’ for almost eight years. During COVID-19, I narrated this subject (‘Salaar’) to Prabhas sir and he agreed to do it,” he recalled. The USP of Salaar is an emotion between two friends and how this emotion translates to violence forms the core of the story, Neel said.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the director, equal importance should be given to the story and the characters in big-budget films. “We make a movie to tell a story and we want the right characters, right actors to portray every role. There’s a commercial aspect with a star and we get bigger budgets to do what we want. But the criteria is the same that this is the character, it is not the hero who is playing the hero because if we think like that then we have lost the battle,” he added.
With Salaar, Neel said his aim was for Prabhas (Baahubali) to shed his superstar persona. “There was never a pressure to make ‘Salaar’. The idea is to make sure that the actor looks like a character. You don’t want to show Prabhas as Prabhas, you want to show him as a character and I tried our best to do something like that,” he said.
While the director acknowledged that Prabhas has had a difficult run at the box office with his recent releases Adipurush and Radhe Shyam, he said a star can always bounce back after a hit film. “Prabhas is a big star. After ‘Baahubali’, he became the biggest star. People are not going to forget something like that. Stars have always been stars; they can have one flop or 20 flops, they just need to give one hit. Recently, Shah Rukh Khan showed us that a star is always a star, there’s no denying that,” Neel added.
A box office showdown is expected between Salaar and Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki. The latter, starring Shah Rukh Khan, will hit the screens a day before Salaar on Thursday. About the release, Neel said he doesn’t meddle in the business aspect of a movie. “I don’t get involved in the logistics of what happens after the movie is ready. My brief is I’ve to make a movie on a given budget and I’ve to give it to them at a time that they want to release,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The filmmaker said he has utmost respect for Hirani and Shah Rukh. “I loved whatever they put out (referring to assets of ‘Dunki’). People always want to see the most human thing in any trailer or teaser, so we try to do that. Even in the larger-than-life movies we try to do that.”
Produced by Hombale Films, Salaar also stars Shruti Haasan, Eshwari Rao, Jagapathi Babu and Sriya Reddy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/salaar-director-prashanth-neel-defends-prabhas-stardom-despite-recent-flops-9075037/,entertainment

Soni Razdan says she made Alia Bhatt travel in economy class as a child because she hadn’t ‘earned enough’: ‘There was never any excess money’,"Soni Razdan recalled how her kids, Alia Bhatt and Shaheen Bhatt, had a middle-class upbringing as they lived in a 2BHK in Alia's childhood.","Alia Bhatt grew up in the world of movies as her father Mahesh Bhatt is a filmmaker and mother Soni Razdan is an actor. Even though Alia’s life looked luxurious to others, her mother recalled that she gave her children a “typical middle-class upbringing” as there was “never any excess money.”
In a chat with Rashmi Uchil for her book Raising Stars: The Challenges and Joys of Being A Bollywood Parent, Soni recalled an incident when she was traveling to Dubai with her daughters Alia and Shaheen but since they could not afford three business-class tickets, she made her kids travel in economy. “Once, we were travelling to Dubai and could not afford three business-class tickets. I told my children, ‘I will travel first class, and you guys travel economy.’ They made a face. When I went to check on them, I saw the lady in the seat right in front of them had reclined her seat, and these children had hardly any space in front of them. I told my children, ‘Why don’t you ask her to straighten her seat? Are you guys okay?’ They were miffed and retorted, ‘Why are you asking us how we are doing? We will not tell her anything.’ The lady in front of them was a senior citizen and they felt bad telling her to straighten her seat. It wasn’t a big deal at all.”

Charu Asopa alleges discrimination while looking for a house in Mumbai: ‘Hum single mothers ko ghar nahi dete’,Television actor Charu Asopa shed light on the challenges she encountered as a single mother while searching for a home in Mumbai.,"After ending her three-year-old marriage with Sushmita Sen’s brother Rajeev Sen, television actor Charu Asopa recently shed light on the challenges she encountered as a single mother while searching for a home in Mumbai. In an interview, she revealed the distressing incident of facing discrimination during the process.
Speaking to Hindustan Times, Charu said, “I took a break for one hour between shoots to attend a society meeting of my soon to be new house. Everything was finalised and had even submitted the token money. The members of the committee were mostly males, and there was only one female.”
She added, “She asked me, ‘How many people will live here?’ I told her that it would be me, my daughter, and two maids. She said, ‘No, hum single mothers ko ghar nahi dete (No, we don’t rent home to single mothers).’ I asked her the reason, but she said she doesn’t want to go there or entertain any further discussions on this. She was very rude to me. I was trying to convince her.”

Attempting to understand the basis for this exclusion, Charu Asopa was met with resistance. “People go through tragedies, but you can’t do this. She wasn’t ready for any discussion and said, ‘You are wasting my time, I don’t want to spoil my mood in the morning.’ It was very heartbreaking for me and I couldn’t control my tears,” she said.

"Boman Irani: ‘Ready to pay Rs 5 crore for writers, but is the script worthy of it?’",Bollywood actor Boman Irani said writers should become so good that filmmakers can't do without them.,"Bollywood actor Boman Irani has opened up about a topic that has been the subject of debate across the world: underpaid writers. Only recently Writers Guild of America went on a historic strike for about 148 days for fair pay and many other reasons. While the Indian film industry is far behind in recognising writers as an important component of filmmaking, the discourse has started, and Boman Irani has come out with a rather bold statement about how writers have to become good enough to demand good income for their work.
Speaking to Jist Unscripted, Boman said, “I am going to make a bit of a controversial statement. It is said writers are not getting their due. Yes, they are not. Writers are not paid enough. Yes, they are not. But you have to become worthy. Good writing should become so common that we can’t operate without these guys. You should become worthy. There are fantastic writers but they are few. When you say we are not getting our due… you have to write well. If you give me a watertight script, everything goes well. Even an average director will make a good film if you have a good script. So, the writers become the hero.”

Here’s a glimpse of Raghuthatha:

Directed by Suman Kumar, Raghuthatha also stars M S Bhaskar, Devadarshini, Ravindra Vijay, Anandsami and Rajesh Balakrishnan. Sean Roldan is composing the music for the film, while Yamini Yagnamurthy is handling the camera. The makers have called the movie “a rollicking, hilarious adventure”.

Raghuthatha, the title of the film, is inspired by the popular comedy sequence from Bhagyaraj’s Indru Poi Naalai Vaa. The scene involves a Hindi teacher trying to teach the sentence, “Ek gaav mein ek kisaan rahata tha (A farmer lived in a village).” The reluctant and spoilt student keeps repeating the sentence as ‘Raghu thatha’ which, in Tamil, means Raghu’s grandfather. The sequence was a huge hit back then and has remained a part of Tamil pop culture.
Meanwhile, Hombale Films’ biggest project Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire is all set to be released on December 22 across the world in multiple languages. Starring Prabhas and directed by Prashanth Neel, the film also has Prithviraj in the lead role.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/keerthy-suresh-and-hombale-films-join-hands-for-raghuthatha-9074481/,entertainment
Main Atal Hoon teaser: Pankaj Tripathi tries hard to capture the essence of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Watch,Main Atal Hoon teaser: Pankaj Tripathi is playing the role of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the late politician's biopic.,"Pankaj Tripathi is all set to lead the biopic of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the teaser of the same dropped on Tuesday. Here, Atal is seen engrossed in a conversation with LK Advani as they discuss their political future. Pankaj’s Atal does not sound much like the late PM, which is an odd choice since Vajpayee was a popular orator and had a distinct style when he spoke.
The rest of the cast of the film is yet to be announced. Main Atal Hoon has been directed by Ravi Jadhav, who has previously directed National Award-winning Marathi films Natarang, Balgandharva and Balak Palak. He also recently directed the Sushmita Sen-led JioCinema series Taali.

In the interview, when asked about the gender pay disparity between Vijay and Nayanthara, Shine explained that the disparity is not just about gender but it goes beyond all aspects including acting skills. “How much Vijay is getting paid? How much are Mammootty and Mohanlal getting paid? Is Vijay better than them? Is Vijay better than Kamal Haasan? So, it is not about skills. It is beyond gender whether it is an actor or an actress.”

Veteran actor Tanuja discharged from hospital: ‘All her health parameters were normal’,Veteran actor Tanuja was admitted to a Mumbai hospital on Sunday. She was discharged on Monday night.,"Veteran actor Tanuja, who was hospitalised on Sunday in Mumbai, has been discharged from the hospital. A source told PTI, “She was discharged from the hospital late last night as all her health parameters were normal.” Tanuja was admitted due to age-related illness and was under observation at the ICU.
Known for her films like Baharein Phir Bhi Ayengi (1966), Jewel Thief (1969), Paisa Ya Pyaar (1969), Haathi Mere Saathi (1971) and Mere Jeevan Sathi, Tanuja is the daughter of veteran actor Shobhna Samarth and producer Kumarsen Samarth, and the sister of celebrated Hindi film actor Nutan. Her daughters Kajol and Tanisha are also in the movies.
In a chat with Times Now, Dhramendra recalled the days of collaborating with Tanuja and said, “She is always a livewire. Very spontaneous in front of the camera, and even more so in person. The first film we did together was Atma Ram’s Baharen Phir Bhi Ayengi where Guru Dutt was to play the lead. When he passed away, I replaced him.”

In an earlier chat with Film Companion, Kajol said that she find sit hard to watch her mother’s work on screen and said, “I have not watched too many of my mother’s films. Because I feel so much for her that I’m never able to separate myself from her. And when she cries on screen, I just sit and I bawl. So I have no objectivity where she’s concerned. She just makes me howl. And I think my children feel the same way about me when they see me on screen. So they can’t watch either.”

Jyotika says leaving Tamil industry was necessary to secure a diverse role; Siddharth lauds Kamal Haasan for taking bold risks,"Jyotika recently maintained that she rarely received genuinely diverse characters in Tamil industry. Meanwhile, Siddharth emphasised that no one else could parallel the impact Kamal Haasan had on the industry, consistently contributing to its evolution.","Ever since she returned to cinema after an eight-year hiatus in 2015 with Rosshan Andrrews’ 36 Vayadhinile, Jyotika has been committed to avoiding the pitfalls of typecasting that marked the early phase of her career. To achieve this, she has embraced a variety of roles in the last few years, consistently pushing boundaries, even if it meant doing just one or two projects annually.
Jeo Baby’s Kaathal—The Core, in which she appeared alongside Malayalam superstar Mammootty, is a testament to her unconventional movie choices, as the film revolves around a homosexual man and a wife’s attempts to help him come out to society.

Meanwhile, she recently elaborated on her film choices and asserted that there are a lot of offers she says no to, while maintaining that even amidst all this, she rarely received genuinely diverse characters in Tamil industry.

“As far as women are concerned, it’s a different battle altogether, especially down South. As you turn 35-40, there are fewer options. If you’re doing well, then you are typecasted as well. In my case, I did a lot of good roles. I was a crusader who ran a government school in one film and a housewife in another. I did everything good there. But there was no room for grey. So I opted to do a Malayalam film instead, and that brought me here,” she said while taking part in Film Companion Actors’ Adda.

“My journey is all through Tamil, but a Malayalam film brought me here, sitting with such lovely actors on this platform. So, I guess you have to flow; you can’t be stagnant and swim in a pond. There’s an ocean out there. It’s time we all got in there, dived, and just discovered what’s happening.
“For women, you have to say no to a lot of things, especially in the realm of popular cinema because 90 per cent of the time, it doesn’t make sense what the girls are doing there. So, I have consciously taken this decision that when women come out after watching my films, they should have their heads held high. It’s a journey. It has its ups and downs, but your choice is what determines it,” she added.”

Marvel and Disney part ways with actor Jonathan Majors following guilty verdict on assault and harassment charges,A Manhattan jury on Monday found Jonathan Majors guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation for a March altercation with his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.,"Marvel had more riding on Jonathan Majors than perhaps any other actor. Now it’s parting ways with him, and throwing years of plans for its cinematic universe in disarray.
Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. dropped Majors from all future projects following the actor’s conviction for assault and harassment on Monday, according to a person close to the studio who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The swift move by Disney marked a stunning about-face for an actor who had been one of Hollywood’s fastest-rising stars. A Manhattan jury on Monday found the 34-year-old Majors guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation for a March altercation with his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.
ADVERTISEMENT
Majors, who was acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment, will be sentenced on Feb 6. He declined to comment as he left the courthouse. Majors’ attorney, Priya Chaudhry, said in a statement that “it is clear that the jury did not believe Grace Jabbari’s story of what happened in the SUV because they found that Mr Majors did not intentionally cause any injuries to her.”
“Mr Majors still has faith in the process and looks forward to fully clearing his name,” said Chaudhry.
As the superhero studio prepared phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it cast the highly acclaimed Majors as the antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The character was to span several films and series as the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next-phase answer to Thanos, the villain of Avengers: Endgame.
Majors had already appeared in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and the first two seasons of Loki. He was to star in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, dated for release in May 2026.
ADVERTISEMENT
The future of The Kang Dynasty is now unclear. Disney declined to comment on whether it will recast the role of Kang or pivot in a new direction.
Also read | Assault trial for actor Jonathan Majors postponed until September
The studio has been preparing for the possibility of Majors’ exit from the franchise. But Marvel was limited in its ability to fashion rewrites due to the screenwriters strike that ran from May to late September. The studio recently hired screenwriter Michael Waldron to rework The Kang Dynasty.
For Marvel, Majors’ departure adds to a series of recent setbacks. Though its box-office success — nearly $30 billion worldwide from 33 films — is unsurpassed in movie history, the superhero factory has recently seen some atypical struggles. The Marvels, released in November, has been the MCU’s worst performer in theaters, with $204 million in worldwide ticket sales.
Majors also recently starred as a troubled amateur bodybuilder in Magazine Dreams, which made an acclaimed debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was acquired by the Disney-owned indie distributor Searchlight Pictures. Following its premiere, an Oscar nomination for Majors was widely predicted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Magazine Dreams had been dated to open in theaters in Dec 8. But ahead of Majors’ trial, Searchlight removed the film from its release calendar. Instead, on Dec 8 text messages from Majors were read in the fifth day of the trial. In one, Majors begged Jabbari not to seek medical attention for a head injury sustained in 2022, warning she had “no perspective of what could happen” if the truth got out.
In late February as Creed III, starring Majors alongside Michael B Jordan, was being released, Majors spoke in an interview with The Associated Press in the neighborhood of Chelsea, just a few blocks away from where his fight with Jabbari would weeks later spill out onto New York streets.
Majors then sounded acutely aware that his rapid new fame carried the risk of a downfall.
“Though I’ve not seen the boogeyman, I know it’s out there,” Majors said. “And I’ve been around to know it’s comin’. I won’t go down my rabbit hole of death, but it’s comin’. But you outrun it. You just stay out of the frame. I’ll stay out of the frame.”

Unlike Dunki, a comedy-drama, Salaar is an epic action thriller.
Since the release of the Prabhas film’s trailer on December 1, debates have been rife regarding the alleged glorification of on-screen violence in the film — a trend some associate with the surge in “pan-Indian films” like Neel’s KGF series. While some view it as a source of adrenaline or aligning with the respective film’s narrative, others consider it an alarming trend with potential societal repercussions.

"Animal actor Siddhant Karnick: ‘If we accept audience’s love, we must also accept their trolling’","Animal actor Siddhant Karnick said that actors in the same project shouldn't compete for popularity, as he spoke about the different intensity with which Rashmika Mandanna and Triptii Dimri's peformances in the film were received.","Actor Siddhant Karnick, who played a supporting role in the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer blockbuster film Animal, said that each actor got a share of the attention after the film’s success. He was responding to chatter online that Rashmika Mandanna, the female lead of the film, was overshadowed by Triptii Dimri, who appeared in a smaller role but walked away with a lot of attention.
He said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan that he didn’t feel this, and cited the example of Bobby Deol. “Everyone got their own importance. Maybe the intensity was different. For example, Bobby Deol came for 15 minutes, but he’s the next big thing we’re talking about right after Ranbir. The cousins, that pind family, what a beautiful set-up… I don’t think actors within the same project should be competing for popularity. Film does well, everybody does well.”

"‘If someone kills Sunny, I can become a savage’: Bobby Deol reveals what went through his mind while filming key Animal scene",Actor Bobby Deol said that he nailed a key shot in Animal because he tapped into a deeply personal space in his mind to extract the necessary performance.,"Actor Bobby Deol, whose extended cameo in the blockbuster film Animal is being appreciated, spoke about not judging his villainous character, and how he nailed a shot in one take by harnessing personal emotions into his performance. In an interview with Film Companion, Bobby said that he simply imagined someone harming his brother, actor Sunny Deol, and the emotions flowed out of him.
The scene that he was referring to is the one in which his character, Abrar, is informed that his brother has been killed. This sends Abrar on a warpath with Ranbir Kapoor’s Ranvijay, the protagonist of the movie. But because the film doesn’t deal in black and white, Bobby said that in their final face-off, it’s impossible to differentiate between the hero and the villain.

She told Film Companion, “If you are great, talented, and people have liked you, connected with you, stardom will follow.

"10 years of Drishyam: How a seemingly low-key family drama became one of the most influential, impactful Indian films in recent times","10 years, 6 remakes (with another two in the pipeline), 1 sequel and 3 remakes to the sequel later, Jeethu Joseph's Mohanlal-starrer Drishyam continues to generate discussions, primarily focusing on its subsequent third part, as well as its script and the problematic core.","Sometime in early December 2013: Mohanlal has had a challenging year so far. Except for Red Wine, which, despite receiving positive reviews, did not emerge as a big hit, all his other films — Lokpal, Ladies and Gentleman and Geethaanjali — were both panned and turned out to be commercial disappointments. This is in contrast to 2012 when he enjoyed three super hits — Grandmaster, Spirit and Run Baby Run.
Just as the year was coming to a close, the trailer of a movie helmed by Jeethu Joseph, known for Memories (2013), My Boss (2012) and Detective (2007), arrived. However, the trailer failed to generate significant anticipation as it appeared rather sombre. Set against a backdrop of somewhat cheerful music, it immediately revealed that Mohanlal’s character in the film was not larger-than-life but a simple villager, reminiscent of his roles in Sathyan Anthikad movies. The majority of the promo showcased endearing moments between Mohanlal’s character, his wife, two daughters and a couple of other characters. Even as the video approached its conclusion, it only conveyed that the film centred around a family encountering “a few hurdles”, much like any other drama.

"Animal box office collection Day 18: Ranbir Kapoor’s blockbuster just Rs 8 cr shy of beating Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2, becomes third Indian film of 2023 to pass $100 million worldwide","Animal box office collection Day 18: After entering the Rs 500 crore club domestically on Sunday, the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer is on the verge of passing Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 in a matter of days.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandanna, is making the most of the time it has left before Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki arrives in theatres this week. After entering the Rs 500 crore club domestically on Sunday, the film recorded its lowest-ever single-day haul on Monday. It earned Rs 5.50 crore on its 18th day, reported industry tracker Sacnilk.
The total domestic collection of Animal now stands at Rs 517.94 crore. The film needs only around Rs 8 crore to surpass Sunny Deol’s Gadar 2 as the sixth highest-grossing Indian film in India. Gadar 2 ended its theatrical run with Rs 525.7 crore. But time is running out for Animal, with Dunki and Salaar around the corner. SRK’s previous two releases, Jawan (Rs 640.25 cr) and Pathaan (Rs 543.09 cr) hold the fourth and fifth positions in the list of all-time highest-grossing Indian films.

"Prithviraj Sukumaran on Salaar, and beyond: We should be grateful to SS Rajamouli and Prashanth Neel","Malayalam superstar Prithviraj Sukumaran, a lead actor alongside Prabhas in Salaar, speaks to Indian Express about the new movement in Indian cinema that has brought about the amalgamation of different film industries across the country. ","Even before pan-Indian cinema became a thing, Malayalam superstar Prithviraj Sukumaran was known for collaborating with talents across industries. After establishing himself as a promising actor in Malayalam, Prithviraj went on to play a menacing villain named Madhan in Kana Kanden. He is perhaps the very few actors who has won the state awards of both Tamil Nadu (for Kaaviya Thalaivan) and Kerala (Celluloid, Ayalum Njanum Thammil, and Vaasthavam). Prithviraj also made a mark in Bollywood and played it to the stereotype with the song Dreamum Wakeuppam in Aiyaaa. He has also been a part of the Telugu industry with the film Police Police.
With Salaar, directed by Prashanth Neel and starring Prabhas, Prithviraj has become a prominent figure in Tollywood. It is now safe to say that Prithviraj is pan-Indian cinema personified, and no wonder the star has been making a strong case for the amalgamation of all the film industries of India to become one big family. In this chat with indianexpress, he shares more about his take on the ongoing trend.

Prashanth Neel: ‘Salaar cannot be without Prithviraj…he was like the perfect assistant director’,"Prashanth Neel said that without Prithviraj, Salaar wouldn't have become what it is today.","For a long time, director Prashanth Neel and his team were finding it hard to find an actor for the antagonist’s role in Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire. Prashanth, in a recent interview, revealed that he always wanted Prithviraj but wasn’t sure whether the Malayalam star would come on board. But, Prithviraj loved the script and came on board readily and made some valuable creative suggestions that made Salaar what it is today, revealed the Salaar director.
When asked the reason behind casting Prithviraj in Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, Prashanth told Galatta Plus, “We needed an actor more than a star or anything else. We needed a phenomenal actor for the role of Varadharaja Mannar. The friendship that we wanted to show… we wanted someone who could show both the love and the hate in him. For a long time, we were thinking about who should we bring in. A lot of suggestions said that we have to bring in someone from the Hindi film industry. One name that kept popping in my head and I thought was a big ask was Prithviraj. And we pursued him for some time. I thought he wouldn’t agree after hearing the script.”

On The Film Companion Actors’ Adda, Bobby said, “There is so much that happens in your life. There are so many moments you have been hurt and the relationships you share with your family. When I was doing this film and when I was told the story, I didn’t think I was a villain.

Salaar director Prashanth Neel: ‘I try to make small moments work more than the big ones’,"Prashanth Neel, in an interview, said for the mass moments to work, the small emotional moments should work.","Prashanth Neel has revealed why small moments in his films matter more than the big moments like the heroic scenes of KGF movies. The director also shared that it is easy to create mass moments and all the filmmakers have started to create good action blocks.
When asked if he would write certain scenes wondering how the audience is going to react to it, Prashanth told Galatta Plus, “I will give you an example. After KGF came out and it got a response, many people came and said that they liked the bun scene. It has nothing to do with scale or elevation. The way I see successful directors do it and I mimic them in making the small moments work more than the big ones. I think that’s what they (the audience) will take back. In Salaar as well we have put in a lot of those small moments without the big CGI work and punchlines… because that’s what I think is pan-Indian. We all get the fights right. All the movies that I have loved… the pan-Indian movies… I loved their small moments.”

"Thadavu movie review: Beena R Chandran, PP Subramanian and MN Anitha are brilliant in memorable watch","Just like CK Raghavan in Munnariyippu and Brooks Hatlen in The Shawshank Redemption, for Geetha in Fazil Razak's Thadavu, life in the outside world is an unjust sentence she has been burdened with.","“The way you perceive freedom might not be the same as how I do. Sometimes, we might have to weed out certain obstacles in our path. Isn’t that what freedom is?” observes CK Raghavan (Mammootty) in Venu’s Munnariyippu (2014), before finally uprooting the one “annoying” obstacle in his path and returning to prison, where he truly experiences freedom. The situation is somewhat the same for Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) in Frank Darabont’s The Shawshank Redemption (1994). It is in prison that Brooks actually feels a sense of belonging after spending 50 years behind bars. Hence, the “imprisonment” in the outside world is horrifying for both.
On the other hand, for Geetha (Beena R Chandran) in Fazil Razak’s Thadavu (The  Sentence), a myriad of things, including peace, happiness and money to treat a fatal health condition, are unattainable in the real world. Consequently, for all of them, life in the outside world is an unjust sentence they have been burdened with and thus they realise that prisons are where they can breathe with ease.

The war movies have now gotten an upgrade as the drama is unfolding mid-air with fighter planes. We earlier saw it in the trailer of Hrithik Roshan’s Fighter, and now, Varun Tej and Manushi Chhillar-starrer Operation Valentine seems like a lite version of the same air warfare.
Touted to be based on the biggest Indian airstrike in history, Operation Valentine is directed by Shakti Pratap Singh Hada. The film is produced by Sony Pictures and A Renaissance Pictures, who earlier backed another war film Major.

"Netflix joins other OTT platforms, stops global streaming of uncut Indian films: Report","While other OTT platforms have been following this practice for some time, Netflix's decision to cease streaming uncut films has granted the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) indirect control over what Indians watch in films, even online.","While debates surrounding the Central Board of Film Certification’s (CBFC) purportedly unjust censorship of movies intensify, another, possibly the last, streaming platform has completely halted the streaming of uncensored versions of Indian films globally.
As per a report by The Hindu, which it claims to have created after a review of many films released this year, Netflix has now joined the ranks of OTT platforms that discontinued showing versions of Indian films before obtaining CBFC approval.

While other streaming platforms have been following this practice for some time, with few exceptions for specific titles, Netflix’s adoption of this approach effectively grants the CBFC indirect control over what Indians watch in films, even online.
ICYMI | Shah Rukh Khan calls Dunki his ‘best film’, says he made it for himself: ‘I made Jawan and Pathaan for…’
Although Netflix refrained from responding to queries about its changing censorship practices, the streaming service told The Hindu in a statement, “We have an incredibly broad range of Indian original films and TV shows, all of which speak to our long-standing support for creative expression. This diversity not only reflects our members’ very different tastes, it also distinguishes our service from the competition.”
Earlier this year, veteran actor Govind Namdev had condemned the A certificate that was given to OMG 2 by the CBFC. Govind, in a Facebook post, said that the movie had to undergo 24 cuts and eventually got a “senseless A certificate”, thus, it could not be watched by teenagers who were the target audience of the film.

"Maagh – The Winter Within: The finest Indian film of the year, the only alternative to all the Animals out there","Maagh - The Winter Within: Soulful, stirring, and simmering with scorched-earth rage, Aamir Bashir's sophomore feature is the best Indian film of the year.","There wasn’t a dry eye in the house as writer-director Aamir Bashir walked towards the stage following the Dharamshala International Film Festival screening of his new film, Maagh – The Winter Within. A modern-day fable about Kashmir, Maagh played to stunned silence for over an hour-and-a-half, before earning a most well-deserved standing ovation. Bashir, who previously directed the under-seen Harud (Autumn) more than a decade ago, spoke soberly about the never-ending winter that his home has been shrouded under. After answering a few questions, he took his leave, dismissing the moderator’s optimistic suggestion that his trilogy would remain incomplete without the obvious next instalment. He joked mirthlessly that he already has a title for his third film: Our Spring Will Never Come.
Soulful, stirring, and simmering with scorched-earth rage, The Winter Within is the best Indian film of the year, a stifled scream of a movie that is as breathtaking to behold as it is heart-wrenching to watch. It tells the story of a young woman named Nargis (a magnetic Zoya Hussain), who works as a house help in Srinagar and reports like clockwork at a local detention centre where she suspects her missing husband, Manzoor (Manzoor Ahmad Bhat), has been kept under suspicion of being a militant. Nargis is among the thousands of ‘half-widows’ of Kashmir, women who don’t know if their husbands are alive or not, cursed to spend their lives in an emotional limbo.

She makes ends meet by weaving shawls that she sells to a local businessman named Yaseen (Shabir Ahmad Lone) who secretly harbours feelings for her, but maintains a respectful distance. But when Nargis attracts unexpected attention for her determined quest to locate Manzoor, she is fired from her job and forced to return to her village home. There, as a member of a nomad community, she is further marginalised by her own. Bashir’s film calls into question the many atrocities that have been inflicted upon his people, but he doesn’t hesitate to offer internal critique about the corruption of the complacent and the the apathy of the elite.
A still from The Winter Within.
The early scenes are marked by a quiet oppression and the illusion of peace. Everyday realities are captured remarkably by co-writer and cinematographer Shanker Raman’s composed, Kiarostami-esque camera, which hovers with equal ease over the hills and valleys of Kashmir’s landscape and the expressive faces of its people. The paranoia, on the other hand, is built through stray shots of commandos, armed trucks passing in the background, and the sound of radio chatter. Music is used sparingly; the film’s searing emotion is conveyed mostly through a series of close-ups that are confrontational by design. In these 90 minutes, you will not be allowed to avert your eyes from this tragedy; you thought you were free, but complicity, the movie says, is its own form of capture.
Shortly after Nargis’ return to her village, and mere hours after Yaseen has made his feelings known, Manzoor shows up out of the blue, adding a new layer of complexity to her life. Clearly traumatised by his imprisonment, he is unable to eat or sleep. Instead, he spends his days and nights smoking endlessly near the window, framed in stunning tableaus once again designed to draw your attention to the horrors hidden beneath the beauty of this land. Bashir satirises how outsiders view the Valley in a shocking sequence towards the end, when Manzoor tries to rehabilitate himself by finding work in the tourism industry. Oh, the irony. It’s like the displaced Tibetan community in India having to sell Chinese food in order to make ends meet. Manzoor tugs entitled young couples across the snow, the rope wrapped around his neck like a noose. He is a mule. He is a servant. He is a dead man walking. The tourists — these are the kind of people who probably watched The Kashmir Files in theatres — scream at him to hurry up, to pull harder. They abused him when he chose violence, and they abuse him now, after his spirit and body have been systematically destroyed.
A still from The Winter Within.
But there’s hope yet for Nargis, or, at least that’s what we try to convince ourselves into believing. She represents both the harsh realities and poetic ideals of Kashmir. As the wife of a militant, her reputation has forever been stained. But she didn’t pick up arms like her husband, despite her desire for ‘azaadi’; she chose to preserve her identity through her art. Through the course of the film, Nargis crafts the most intricate shawl — her magnum opus; an ode to the resilience of an entire community, and a symbol of her silent protest. In many ways, Nargis is Bashir — a custodian of her culture, and a chronicler of its pain.

You become so familiar with the contours of her face over 90 minutes, it begins to have an oddly comforting affect. Which is why the final shot — one of the most haunting images in recent memory — will linger forever in my mind. Almost as an act of defiance, the camera detaches itself from its tripod and begins scanning the surroundings for some stability. It is as if the movie is finally shedding its own delusions. Hope is a pipe dream for some, regardless of whether they’re living in conflict zones or making films in an industry that actively seems to be averse to empathy. Those predisposed to bigotry will not be converted by this film’s beauty; it would be irrational to think otherwise, especially in an era where sensitivity is seen as something to snark at and ‘content’ is greenlit on the basis of whether it could make a good thumbnail or not. But by merely existing, The Winter Within can thaw the coldest hearts.

"Sunny Deol says audience is watching his older films after Gadar 2 success: ‘Now, I will keep doing movies’","Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 emerged as a massive hit, grossing over Rs 500 crore worldwide. The actor discussed how the film's success has played a pivotal role in establishing his connection with the younger audience.","Actor Sunny Deol believes his recent release Gadar 2 has helped him establish a connection with the younger audiences, who have now started exploring his past filmography.
The Anil Sharma-directorial, which hit the screens in August, turned out to be a surprise hit of the year with over Rs 500 crore in worldwide gross box office collection, much like its predecessor Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, which was the highest grossing Hindi movie of 2001.
“With ‘Gadar 2′, what happened is all my fans and all the people that wanted to see the kind of cinema which they had seen in ‘Gadar’… We kept the story that way and people came to see the character, which is deep rooted in their hearts. “But the beauty of it was the new generation that has got connected to me. I was not connected to them otherwise. They got to see what I’m doing (in ‘Gadar 2’) and are now seeing some of my older films,” Deol told PTI in an interview here.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 66-year-old actor reprised his role of Tara Singh in Gadar 2, set years after the events of the first movie. It saw Tara Singh return to Pakistan in order to rescue his imprisoned son Charanjeet “Jeete” Singh (played by Utkarsh Sharma) during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
When Gadar 2 came out, Deol said, he visited some theatres and was bowled over by the response. “I could see the love and appreciation. It all felt good. I’m thankful for the love and trust in me. From now on, I’ll keep doing movies that people will love,” he added.
Prior to the film’s release, Deol said the sentiment among the industry folks and critics was that the movie will not work at the ticket window. “We would not know about the sentiment of the audience, we would know about the sentiment of the industry. Yahan industry ka sentiment itna woh nahi tha (The sentiment in the industry was not positive), they were making predictions, the critics and even others bashed the film,” he said.

But the audience is open to all kinds of movies, whether it is his movie, his younger brother Bobby Deol’s Animal or Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, which featured his father Dharmendra in a pivotal role.

“We make films for the audience. Our films are made for all kinds of audiences. Like, there’s ‘Animal’ and ‘Rocky Rani’. Audience is accepting all kinds of films. If the critics want to critique a film, then they should write a thesis on art movies, this cinema is not for that.”
“It is high time that we all be nice and happy that this year has been so good for us and the audience is going back to theatres. We are today offering films that they want to see. It is a good time for Hindi cinema and I believe this will continue.” As the eldest son of cinema icon Dharmendra, Deol started his cinema journey in 1983 with Betaab and enjoyed a great run in the initial years with hits such as Arjun, Ghayal, Damini, Ghatak, Border, Arjun Pandit and Gadar, among others. Post Gadar, he went through a dry patch which took him 20 years to overcome.
What kept Deol going all these years is his sportsman spirit and a positive frame of mind. “You have to walk a path. No matter how much you talk about it, argue or (do) self-pity, you still have to walk. Why waste your energy? “I’m a sports guy. You win or you lose, you learn and you move ahead. Sports guys have a positive adrenaline and that’s what I have in me. I’m one of those guys who gets up before the sun rises and goes to sleep (early). I love the days, I can’t take the nights,” he said.
Asked whether he learned anything during the rough patch in his career, the actor said a person grows every day. “That’s how you keep moving, rather than sitting and thinking about it because what has to happen will happen. If it (success of ‘Gadar 2′) hadn’t happened, I would still be working like this only and would be trying to do something or the other. I would not be grumbling and criticising,” he said.

The actor revealed he is working on a number of projects, including the sequel to his 2007 movie Apne. The follow-up will also feature his father Dharmendra, brother Bobby and son Karan Deol.
Besides, he will also star in Baap with Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff and Mithun Chakraborty, and Lahore, 1947, which will be produced by superstar Aamir Khan.
“There were a lot of proposals coming and it is very difficult to work with all of them. You can’t do everything. There are a couple of films that I’m doing and they will be announced when they are ready to be announced. There’s a lot to do. I haven’t done much in the last so many years,” Deol said.
“Since ‘Gadar 2′, I’ve been doing a lot of films. There’s ‘Lahore’ and talks are on for ‘Border 2′,” he added. When asked if he will be collaborating with any contemporary filmmaker, the actor said directors of his era are still masters when it comes to presenting society and the nation’s rich history.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I somehow feel that directors with whom I’ve worked have more of a sense of society, emotions, values, country and our history. And that was reflected in our films, and that connected with people as well. Today, things are being made, they are nice and interesting but we are lacking in depth.” Deol, who turned director for films like Dillagi (1999), Ghayal Once Again (2016) and 2019’s Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas, which marked his son Karan’s debut, has no plans to direct a movie.
“I’m not going to be on the other side anymore. I just want to be an actor. As an actor, I’ve taken myself away from everything,” he said.

Siddhant Karnick, who plays Ranbir Kapoor’s brother-in-law in the film, has now discussed a particular scene where Ranbir’s character, Ranvijay, pulls on Rashmika Mandanna’s character’s bra strap, leaving her in pain. 
In an interview with Bollywood Now, Siddhant was asked about his reaction to the scene as an audience member and the actor said that the audience shouldn’t judge them. He also implied that Rashmika’s character might have consented to this, even though the film doesn’t really say that. He said, “I understood the kinkiness Ranbir’s character was trying to show with the bra strap. See there are terms called masochism and sadism, which are used in sexual orientation. That showed that Rashmika’s character could be a masochist. She was agreeable to that kind of act.”

"IFFK 2023: Chalachithra Academy chairman Ranjith faces discontent, gets booed during closing ceremony",IFFK 2023: Kerala State Chalachithra Academy Chairman Ranjith was booed by the audience during his speech at the closing ceremony of the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala.,"The 28th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) concluded with a vibrant ceremony at the Nishagandhi Auditorium in Kanakakunnu Palace, Thiruvananthapuram, on Friday, with actor Prakash Raj as the chief guest.
However, similar to the 27th edition’s closing ceremony, Kerala State Chalachithra Academy chairman, Ranjith, was booed by the audiences when he stood up to address the gathering. While everyone else, including Prakash Raj, received enthusiastic applause, Ranjith alone faced this negative reaction from the public, although he chose not to address it in his speech.

Meanwhile, the KSCA chairman invited the Academy staff onto the stage. These staff members had worked tirelessly to ensure the smooth execution of the film festival. This move prompted the viewers to stop booing Ranjith, allowing the workers to join the stage without facing embarrassment.

Last year, Ranjith came under intense scrutiny when some attendees were arrested for protesting at the IFFK after they were denied seats for Lijo Jose Pellissery’s Mammootty-starrer Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam, despite having reservations and waiting in line for hours. During the closing ceremony, when the audiences expressed disapproval, Ranjith compared them to street dogs, intensifying the controversy.

While discontent has lingered since Ranjith assumed the role of KSCA chairman in January last year, it reached unprecedented levels this year. Even members of the Academy openly expressed dissatisfaction with Ranjith’s conduct on several occasions. On December 14, a day before the festival’s conclusion, a group of nine members of the Academy’s general council held a meeting, and sent a letter to the state government, demanding Ranjith’s removal as KSCA chairman.
In the complaint, the nine members accused Ranjith of disregarding their opinions and described his decisions as arbitrary, Manorama Online reported. The nine members openly rebelling against the chairman are Manoj Kana, Cuckoo Parameswaran, N Arun, Mummy Centuary, Prakash Sreedhar, Shaibu Mundakkal, A S Jobu, Siby and Santhosh, according to the media house.
Speaking to Reporter TV, director Manoj Kana said that many of Ranjith’s recent remarks about his colleagues were in poor taste. Pointing out that each general council member has specific duties, Kana recalled that when Cuckoo Parameswaran recently approached Ranjith with a complaint, he dismissed her concerns, stating that “her services were no longer needed at the IFFK”. Stressing that Ranjith’s authoritative behaviour and arrogance were hindering their ability to work with him, Kana mentioned that they have submitted written complaints to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Culture and Youth Affairs Minister Saji Cherian and the Chalachithra Academy. Kana added, “In the formal complaint, we’ve insisted on either his self-correction or his removal from the position. Our stance is not against either the government or KSCA. Our objective is to prevent any negative impact on the reputation of both entities.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Kana emphasised that their objection was solely directed at Ranjith’s elitist and autocratic behaviour. He stated, “Ranjith is disparaging everyone through interviews. This is not the Varikkasseri Mana location; this is the Chalachithra Academy.”
Express at IFFK | Family movie review: Don Palathara’s stellar film exposes how family, religious institutions and society create a safe space for predators
The controversy this year sparked when Ranjith, in an interview with The New Indian Express, made critical comments about renowned filmmaker Dr Biju, questioning the latter’s “relevance” based on the limited audience turnout for his recent release, Adrishya Jalakangal, which was also screened in the Kaleidoscope category of the recently concluded IFFK.
Meanwhile, following a strong critique of Ranjith, Dr Biju resigned from his position as a board member of the Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC). In the same TNIE interview, Ranjith also made controversial comments about actor Bheeman Reghu and criticised many others and their films, including Mohanlal and his dialogue delivery in P Padmarajan’s Thoovanathumbikal (1987).
However, amid all the controversies, Ranjith dismissed any discord on Friday, stating that everything is in order at the Academy. “Everything what’s been heard is the creation of the media. There has been no meeting at all, and those who are out in the open are only a few, as three of them whom they named have told me they did not take part in any meeting. There is no question of me resigning as there exists no such issue. If at all it happens, you (the media) will be the first to be told,” IANS quoted Ranjith as saying.

As both the Chief Minister and the Culture Minister are currently engaged in the government’s ongoing Nava Kerala Sadas program, an official response to the controversy is still pending. With the programme set to conclude in less than 10 days, a final decision on the matter is anticipated soon.
A screenwriter-turned-filmmaker, Ranjith has faced substantial criticism over the years for his films, which are often scrutinised for promoting elitism, misogyny and casteism within savarna narratives. He is widely recognised as an artist who has played a role in popularising regressive ideologies through Malayalam cinema.
Previously, popular filmmaker Vinayan had also levelled serious allegations against Ranjith, accusing him of influencing the Kerala State Film Award committee. In a series of Facebook posts, Vinayan alleged that Ranjith misused his power as Chalachitra Academy chairman and tried to prevent his latest movie Pathonpatham Noottandu from receiving major awards.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/iffk-2023-chalachithra-academy-chairman-ranjith-faces-discontent-gets-booed-during-closing-ceremony-9070547/,entertainment

‘Aamir Khan said please consider me for Langda Tyagi’: Vishal Bhardwaj recalls overlooking Saif Ali Khan’s ‘ajeeb performances’ to cast him in Omkara,"Vishal Bhardwaj said that Aamir Khan was excited to play Langda Tyagi in Omkara, and revealed why he cast Saif Ali Khan instead.","Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj said that Aamir Khan was interested in playing Langda Tyagi in the 2006 film Omkara, and he made his feelings known while they were working together on a separate project that didn’t materialise. He also revealed that Saif Ali Khan was chosen to play the role because he was willing to put in the hard work, but was reluctant to cut his hair.
Talking about casting Saif Ali Khan as Langda Tyagi in Omkara, the filmmaker said in an interview with mid-day, “For Saif, I think, Aamir is responsible for that.” When asked how, he responded by saying, “We were doing that film together, so I spent a lot of time with Aamir. He is lovely company, and it’s fun to hang around with him. Aamir would share what he had in his mind and ask me what I had in my mind to plan for the future. So, I told him that I have this Othello, and this Langda Tyagi character with me.”

Vishal shared that the Dangal star was fascinated by Langda Tyagi’s character. “He told me, ‘Whenever you make this film, I’d love to be considered for Langda Tyagi.’ So that remained with me, but the film didn’t happen, I wasn’t working for one and a half years. I wanted to make a film desperately, so I thought if this character can excite Aamir so much, then I can excite some another star with this. At the time, I had seen Saif’s work.”
Asked why Omkara didn’t happen with Aamir, Vishal revealed, “He was busy, he did Rang De Basanti, and I didn’t want to get stuck for another one and a half years. I wanted to (make the film), with whoever I get.”
When I saw Saif in Dil Chahta Hai, what Saif was before that, his voice was a little feminine, his performance would be ajeeb (weird). But in Dil Chahta Hai, he really worked on himself. In Dil Chahta Hai, he was a different Saif. I felt that he had a fire in him and had transformed himself. And he had shot up,” he added.
Vishal shared that when he pitched the film to Saif, he asked the actor, “Are you ready to work hard? Because nobody would be able to imagine that you can do that role. Nobody could imagine.” He continud, “But he was ready to do that. He really (worked hard), except cutting his hair. With great effort, we convinced him to cut his hair because he was not ready to cut it. Other than that he was more than I asked for.”

Omkara also starred Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor and Vivek Oberoi. It was the second installment in the filmmaker’s Shakespeare trilogy, which also includes Maqbool and Haidar.

"Animal box office collection day 15: Ranbir Kapoor’s controversial film aims for Rs 500 crore domestically, Rs 800 crore worldwide","Animal box office collection day 15: Sandeep Reddy Vanga's controversial film, starring Ranbir Kapoor, will shoot past the Rs 800 crore this weekend.","Actor Ranbir Kapoor’s blockbuster film Animal, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, is targeting the Rs 500 crore mark at the domestic box office this weekend. The film reached a total of Rs 484.34 crore on Friday, its 15th day of release. Animal has been on an indestructible path at the box office amid criticism for its treatment of women and glorification of toxic masculinity.
According to trade website Sacnilk, early estimates suggest that on its 15th day of release, Animal earned Rs 7.5 crore at the Indian box office. However, if the standalone performance is to be gauged, Friday marked the film’s lowest single-day haul. Animal has made Rs 784.45 crore worldwide in the first two weeks of its release, and should be able to pass the Rs 800 crore mark this weekend. Animal will also become the third Bollywood film of the year, behind Pathaan and Jawan, to gross more than $100 million globally.
This weekend is perhaps the last clear run that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film has left, considering Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki will be released on December 21, followed by Prabhas’s Salaar just the next day. Dunki and Salaar are heavyweight films and will take up shows in Hindi and South language belts. Animal is currently the third-biggest Indian film of the year, and will soon pass Pathaan at the domestic box office. It is also Ranbir’s biggest-ever film, and the biggest A-rated movie of all time.

Animal clashed with Vicky Kaushal’s Sam Bahadur on December 1. But despite its obvious box office success, Animal invited massive criticism from several critics for its misogynist and violent content. Vanga’s film also stars Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna and Bobby Deol in pivotal roles, and revolves around an emotionally imbalanced relationship between a father and son.

"The Worst Films of 2023: Animal, Adipurush and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan feature in Shubhra Gupta’s list","An ugly, misogynistic paean to the Alpha male; a crass mash-up of Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones, minus any signs of reverence and piety; and a godawful Salman Khan film find place in Shubhra Gupta's worst films of 2023 list.","When I started thinking of the worst films of the year, Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal won hands down. There were several turkeys in 2023, but nothing can beat this ugly, misogynistic paean to the Alpha male who thinks nothing of demeaning the women around him – mothers, sisters, wives, lovers – just to prove his ‘mardaangi’. Scratch that, not even demeaning, it’s debasing. It is a film which may well turn out to be the biggest blockbuster of the year. It has given Ranbir Kapoor an unimaginable career boost. The other stars, especially Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Tripti Dimri, will all get a leg-up on that tricky ladder which combines remuneration and recognition. But the film will be a blot on their CVs.
The only other one that can conceivably come close is Adipurush, which was supposed to be a worshipful tribute to the Maryada Purushottam. But this Om Raut monstrosity, starring Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan and Kriti Sanon, was dead on arrival: you can hide behind synonyms — Ram is Raghav, Sita is Janaki, Ravan is Lankesh– but there’s no running away from the fact that it was a confused, crass mash-up of Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones, minus any signs of reverence and piety.
Adipurush stars Prabhas as Raghav (Ram), Kriti Sanon as Janaki (Sita) and Saif Ali Khan as Lankesh (Raavan).
If you want a cringe-fest, just listen to its dialogues again. There are so many awful ones that I didn’t know which to pick. But, okay, here goes: ‘Kapda tere baap ka, tel tere baap ka, aag bhi tere baap ki, toh jalegi bhi tere baap ki.’ Ram ram.

And how can I forget The Kerala Story which claimed that it was doing a noble thing by uncovering the dastardly plans of spiriting away innocent Hindu and Christian young women from Kerala and converting them to Islam. Director Sudipto Sen and creative producer Vipul Amrutlal Shah claimed that their film was based on truth, telling the story of 32,000 young women who were held captive in ISIS camps on the Syria-Turkey border: it turned out that the number was 3, but the filmmakers did not think that there was a difference between the two numbers.
A still of Adah Sharma from The Kerala Story movie.
It doesn’t just have a communal slant; the film peddles disinformation disingenuously, simply to increase polarisation in an already fractured polity. It’s also a badly-made, badly-acted film.
After breezing in to help Pathaan, Salman Khan went off to play in his own franchise. And showed up in Tiger 3, only to have wifey Katrina Kaif nearly dropping a towel and winning a deadly duel, neatly eclipsing the one and only Bhai. Is I-Spy is the only game left for this Khan? It would appear that there’s nothing else we want to see him do. Even his most ardent fans deserted him in the godawful Kisi Ka Bhai, Kisi Ki Jaan, in which Bhaijaan plays yet another version of himself in a plot which can not get over its delight of having him in the first place. Who cares, in fact, if there’s zero plot?

The last spot on this list is a toss-up between Tejas, and Ganapath. The first is Kangana Ranaut’s attempt at being a patriot and a fighter-pilot, in which she isn’t as terrible as the movie, but cannot save it from crash-landing. The kindest thing I can say about ‘Ganapath’, starring Tiger Shroff, Kriti Sanon and Amitabh Bachchan, is that it should have stayed as an idea.

"Matthew Perry died from the effects of ketamine, autopsy report says","The medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry’s body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn’t explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.","Matthew Perry died from the acute effects of the anesthetic ketamine, according to the results of an autopsy on the 54-year-old “Friends” actor released Friday. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in “the heated end of his pool,” but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident.People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety.
But the medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry’s body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn’t explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.
The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed.The amount of ketamine detected “would be enough to make him lose consciousness and lose his posture and his ability to keep himself above the water,” said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a medical toxicologist with Johns Hopkins Medicine who reviewed the autopsy report at the request of The Associated Press.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Using sedative drugs in a pool or hot tub, especially when you’re alone, is extremely risky and, sadly, here it’s fatal,” said Stolbach, who noted that both ketamine and buprenorphine can be used safely.Perry was declared dead after being found unresponsive at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Investigators performed the autopsy the following day. The actor had taken drugs in the past but had been “reportedly clean for 19 months,” according to the report.
Perry had played pickleball earlier in the day, the report says, and his assistant, who lives with him, found him face down in the pool after returning from errands. The assistant told investigators Perry had not been sick, had not made any health complaints, and had not shown evidence of recent alcohol or drug use.Postmortem blood tests showed “high levels” of ketamine in his system, which could have raised his blood pressure and heart rate and dulled his impulse to breathe. Buprenorphine, commonly used in opioid addiction and found in therapeutic levels in Perry’s blood, could have contributed to the breathing problem, the autopsy said. It would have been risky to mix the central nervous system depressant with ketamine “due to the additive respiratory effects when present with high levels of ketamine,” according to the autopsy report. The report said his coronary artery disease would have made him more susceptible to the drugs’ effects.
Perry was among the biggest television stars of his generation when he played Chandler Bing alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit sitcom “Friends.”His castmates, like many of his friends, family and fans, were stunned by his death, and paid him loving tribute in the weeks that followed. Perry was open about discussing his struggles with addiction dating back to his time on “Friends.”
“I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,” he wrote in his 2022 memoir. “I had a secret and no one could know.” A woman whose name is redacted in the autopsy report told investigators that Perry had been in good spirits when she spoke to him a few days earlier, but had been taking testosterone shots which she said were making him “angry and mean.” She said he had quit smoking two weeks earlier.The woman said he had been receiving the ketamine infusions for his mental health, and that his doctor had been giving them to him less often because he had been feeling well.Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic approved by U.S. health regulators for use during surgery, but in the past decade it has emerged as an experimental treatment for a range of psychiatric and hard-to-treat conditions, including depression, anxiety and chronic pain.While not approved by regulators, doctors are free to prescribe drugs for these alternate uses if they think their patients could benefit, and hundreds of clinics across the U.S. offer ketamine infusions and other formulations for various health conditions.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/matthew-perry-autopsy-ketamine-9070363/,entertainment
"‘Amitabh Bachchan didn’t know his mic was on, he was murmuring how he was nervous on first day’: Sujoy Ghosh",Sujoy Ghosh also spoke about the biggest risk of his career and said that nobody gave him money for the film Kahaani.,"Filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh has opened up about how veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan was ‘nervous’ on the first day of a film’s shoot. Sujoy revealed that Amitabh was murmuring to himself and did not realise that his mic was on. The filmmaker also revealed how Vidya Balan starrer Kahaani was his biggest risk and said that nobody gave him money for the film.
On Netflix’s The Director’s Roundtable, Sujoy said, “First days of shoot are the most scariest days and you have no clue what your doing and we used to shi*t bricks right. One day we were shooting and it was the first day of the film and sir was on set and he was giving his first shot and his mic was on. And Amitji was murmuring to himself, ‘Yar yeh pehla din hai, kitna saal hogaya abhi bhi mujhe itna nervous lagta hai (It’s the first day, and even after so many years, I still feel so nervous).’ So we realised we are not the only one.” 
Sujoy and Amitabh Bachchan have collaborated on films like Badla, Aladin and Te3n.

When asked about taking risks, Sujoy Ghosh said, “I think the biggest thing for me was Kahaani. Everybody kind off dissuaded me at that time. ‘Pregnant woman running away in Calcutta? What were you thinking?’ And I think that probably was the biggest step of my career, especially coming out of two mega flops and embarking to such an extent that nobody believed in the film. Nobody gave me money to make the film. But that was good. That’s the biggest risk I ever took.”
Sujoy recently helmed the film Jaane Jaan. The film stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Vijay Varma and Jaideep Ahlawat in the lead roles.

When Film Companion asked Prakash the code that upcoming actors can use for a successful career, he replied, “Nobody has an answer for that because there is no fair play. One is you think you are worthy enough to be in cinema, (you) may not be, (but) who will tell us that? Or, somebody sees you are worthy enough and chisels you, moulds you to it.

"Paradise movie review: Darshana Rajendran, Roshan Mathew film is a masterclass in filmmaking","Prasanna Vithanage's Paradise, starring Darshana Rajendran and Roshan Mathew, is a genre-defying masterpiece that seamlessly weaves in various facets of Sri Lankan society and human nature at large.","In mid-2022, when Sri Lanka was engulfed in massive protests due to mounting discontent against the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government over mismanagement, resulting in a significant economic crisis, a Malayali couple arrives at the economically shattered country for a “cost-effective pleasure trip”. This sets the foundation for ace Sri Lankan filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage’s Paradise. Nevertheless, above this tumultuous setting, lies a genre-defying masterpiece that seamlessly weaves in various facets of the Lankan society and human nature at large.
For the couple, Kesav (Roshan Mathew) and Amritha (Darshana Rajendran), who came “in search of paradise”, the journey through the illustrious history and myths of Sri Lanka is nothing short of mesmerising. But for the locals, these tourists’ aides, fear and uncertainty about their future dominate their lives. Amid the challenges, these moments become their sole means to earn income and contribute to their efforts in revitalising the tourism sector, which once played a significant role in the nation’s economy.

Fight Club movie review: A bloody and slick Vada Chennai where style precedes essence,"A lot of Fight Club can be brushed aside as redundant fight scenes, but each one of them increases the intensity of the problem that warrants its existence.","On-screen violence is a fast-selling commodity currently in Tamil cinema. Lokesh Kanagaraj ushered in the new bloody chapter with Vikram, and now, he seems to have taken it upon himself to sustain the trend. The filmmaker has chosen to present Fight Club with his newly-found production house G Squad. Drug is the common enemy of Lokesh’s films and Fight Club, directed by Abbas A. Rahmath. But it is also the enemy that never gets slayed in either universe. All through Fight Club, there are generous shots of people smoking cigarettes, beedis, joints, and bongs. The clouds of smoke emanating from the mouths and nostrils of the members of this Fight Club are shot with a great sense of aesthetics by cinematographer Leon Britto, who has also shot North Madras with the same brilliance. The rustic style of the film makes drugs more enticing and glamorous than its supposed intention, which is to depict drugs as the root of all evil in that part of society.
Take the name Fight Club for instance. The film is not about a fight club, but North Madras, where fights and violence are portrayed to be the order of the day. Thus, the idea behind naming it after David Fincher’s era-defining film seems to be only to cash in on the popularity and market the film as something as bloody as the Hollywood movie. Naturally, the intention of depicting the problems with drugs takes backstage, and the celebration of it takes centerstage. The ‘social message’ is just an excuse for a stylish portrayal of drugs, bloodshed and violence. In a way, such a trend softens the blow of the intention, which is far worse than the unabashed celebration of the perceived evils. While Fight Club has such ethical and moral problems, as a film, it is easily the most engaging gangster movie in recent times.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/fight-club-movie-review-a-bloody-and-slick-vada-chennai-where-style-precedes-essence-9069779/,entertainment
The Family Plan movie review: Mark Wahlberg’s assassin comedy is the stupider version of Manoj Bajpayee’s The Family Man,The Family Plan movie review: Mark Wahlberg sleepwalks Apple's assassin comedy; the sort of film that you forget while you're watching it.,"The mere sight of Mark Wahlberg on the poster for a family comedy film — posing, by the way, with a baby strapped to his chest — is enough to zap you back to 2005. The Family Plan, the latest in Apple’s never-ending streak of big-budget star vehicles that nobody knows even exist, is about as forgettable as they come. Perhaps the only engaging thing about it is that baby, and the sneaking suspicion that it might be entirely AI-generated.
He moves his arms around and everything. In fact, director Simon Cellan Jones often cuts back to the baby for reaction shots in between fight scenes, as if the baby is some ‘mamaji’ in an Ekta Kapoor serial, caught in the middle of that week’s family drama. With movies like The Family Plan, it becomes the viewer’s responsibility to entertain themselves. And wondering if the baby is real or not is a good way to pass the time. If you don’t quit within 10 minutes, that is. Certainly, Wahlberg doesn’t seem to be in any sort of mood to hold your interest.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/the-family-plan-movie-review-mark-wahlberg-stupid-assassin-comedy-apple-9069445/,entertainment

Fighter teaser, which came out earlier this month, had Hrithik as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania, Deepika as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore, and Anil Kapoor as Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh. The teaser introduced audience to the world of Fighter — soaring jets, slow-mo entry shots, high-adrenaline score, aviator glasses, and a money shot of Hrithik with the Tricolour as he alights from a jet, which might remind people of a similar money shot in War.
Directed by Siddharth Anand, the film also stars Karan Singh Grover and Akshay Oberoi. The film is slated to have a theatrical release on January 25, 2024. The film brings Hrithik and Siddharth together after their blockbuster War while Deepika and the director collaborated on Pathaan earlier this year.

"First Act review: The good, bad and ugly sides of chasing childhood stardom","Deepa Bhatia-directed documentary series reflects on the experiences of veteran child stars like Sarika, Jugal Hansraj, and Darsheel Safary, as well as the current artistes including Hetal Gada and Saloni Daini.","Even though the allure of the entertainment world draws many young ones into its fold, rarely anyone looks beyond their cuteness and natural performances to understand the toll it takes on them. First Act, a six-episode documentary by Deepa Bhatia, not only tries to tell their stories of struggle and success but also does the much-needed exploration of their vulnerabilities and difficulties.
The series, at the very beginning, pieces together glimpses of children of different age groups being auditioned. While young children are mostly tongue-tied or fidgety, older kids articulate better when asked about their ambition. Some children have their acting coaches making them chant that they would become a ‘kalaakar (artist)’ one day. Others have their parents drilling the same into their head.

"Kangana Ranaut echoes Smriti Irani’s statement on paid menstrual leave: ‘It’s periods, not some illness or handicap’",Kangana Ranaut said that women don't a paid period leave as she shared Smriti Irani's statement.,"After Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani said in Rajya Sabha that paid menstrual leave could lead to discrimination against women in the workforce, actor Kangana Ranaut has echoed her statement and said that menstruation is not “some illness or handicap” and “women don’t need paid leave for periods.”
Kangana took to her Instagram stories and shared, “Working woman is a myth, there hasn’t been a single non-working woman in the history of mankind, from farming to house chores to raising kids, women have always been working and nothing has come in the way of their commitment to their families or community or nation. Unless it’s some specific medical condition, women don’t need paid leaves for periods, please understand it’s periods not some illness or handicap.”
Earlier, Smriti Irani, who was previously an actor in television and films, had spoken about this in Rajya Sabha. “Given today women are opting for more and more economic opportunities, I will just put my personal view on this, I am not the officiating ministry. We should not propose issues where women are in some way denied an equal opportunity just because somebody who does not menstruate has a particular viewpoint towards menstruation,” she said. Smriti was responding to a query on whether the government is looking into providing a law for menstrual leave.

But they all come with caveats.
It’s not just about the money, honey: Bollywood made more of it this year than it has in the past few years put together, especially during 2021-22 when it was groaning under the triple whammy of closed theatres during Covid, a holdover of terrible films which were roundly rejected by the audience, and the onslaught of the Southern films (Pushpa, KGF2, RRR) which were unstoppable at the box office.

Also, at that time, as a woman, the constitution of marriage was instilled in you. My mother came from a conservative mindset and she was clear, ‘Be independent, but you should get married.’ Society was like that at that time. I was 16 and was not mature enough.”

Bobby Deol calls his Animal character Abrar a ‘family-oriented romantic’,"Bobby Deol plays the role of Abrar Haque in the recently released film Animal, in which he locks horns with Ranbir Kapoor character.","Actor Bobby Deol, who played the antagonist in the recently released Animal, said he didn’t think of his character as a villain but as someone with childhood trauma. The 54-year-old actor is receiving praise for his brief appearance as Abrar Haque, the menacing mute gangster in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film, fronted by Ranbir Kapoor.
Deol, who returned to the big screen with Animal after four years, described Abrar as a “family man”.
“I didn’t think of my character as a villain. I saw my character as a child who was traumatised when he saw his grandfather committing suicide, so he loses his voice. He swears to avenge his grandfather’s death. He is very family-oriented. He is also romantic, he has three wives. He can kill and also get killed for his family,” the actor said during a session on the second day of Agenda AajTak 2023 on Thursday.

Animal, also starring Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, and Triptii Dimri, is nearing the Rs 800 crore mark in gross worldwide box office collections. The action drama, billed as a father-son story, hit the screens on December 1 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.
Animal may be on its way to becoming one of the highest earning Hindi films of 2023, but it has drawn criticism from a section of social media users for its misogynistic and graphically violent narrative.
Describing violence as an emotion, Deol said people will be able to relate to the degree of violence when they watch the film. “The characters in this movie… the animal in them has woken up. They are all like animals. That’s why there’s violence. This is a family drama, a father-son story, and family relationships. It is a reflection of what happens in a society. Definitely action like that is visually created so that people get intrigued but that kind of action, that kind of violence exists in our society,” he added.
Stories cannot be written without being influenced by what’s happening in society, Deol further said. “I’m an actor, I’m not trying to promote any kind of thing. I’m just an actor portraying something and if the film makes you aware of what is happening around you, it’s the beauty of that,” he said.

The Crown season 6 review: Obsession with William and Kate’s romance brings Netflix’s once-regal show to anticlimactic end,"The Crown season 6, part 2 review: In a baffling act of self-sabotage, Netflix's once-regal show gives the Queen an extended cameo in its final season, instead of a proper send-off.","Monarchies and television shows; both should ideally have sound exit strategies in place before their time is up. Some of the greatest programmes in history have set fire to their reputations because of substandard final episodes. And for Netflix’s The Crown — like its subject, the last remaining survivor of a bygone era — the pressure to nail the landing is doubly difficult. Faced with glossier, more algorithmically savvy competition, the show’s popularity in recent years has dwindled like the monarchy itself.
Much of The Crown’s final season — or, to be precise, the six episode second part — is dedicated to the idea of clean exits. The Queen, played one last time by the under-appreciated Imelda Staunton, spends most of the final episode pondering her own death, and the episodes before that — at least the ones she’s in — wondering if the monarchy has become obsolete. She agrees to introduce some reforms at the advice of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, in addition to representing the existential threat that it faces, also identifies the crown’s many extravagances. These frivolities, he suggests politely, might be contributing to the public’s growing alienation from the royals.

"How Shah Rukh Khan strategised to become a ‘saleable actor’ even before he made his debut, wanted to become a star before working with Kundan Shah ",Vivek Vaswani shared that he and Shah Rukh Khan devised a plan as to how to make him a saleable actor even before he could make his debut.,"Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for over three decades now and 2023 has been the most successful year for him so far in his career. But, back in the early 1990s, when Shah Rukh started his journey in the movies, it wasn’t just about chancing upon one great role after another but he had to actually strategise as to how he could become one of most desired actors in the industry. Actor-producer Vivek Vaswani, who worked with SRK in those days and helped in launching his career in the movies, recently recalled how he promised to make Shah Rukh a star when the actor landed at his doorstep.
In a chat with Film Companion, Vivek said that when SRK was still transitioning from television to films, he would travel back and forth from Delhi as his mother was unwell and every time he landed in Mumbai, Vivek would pick him up from the airport. Until one day, when SRK landed at his house at 4 am with two big bags. Vivek recalled, “He said will you do a film with me? I have been saying it for 2 months, you are the one who is rejecting it.” When Shah Rukh asked Vivek what kind of film he would make with Shah Rukh, the producer had a very clear vision. “I said it’s your launch film so it has to be you and that’s where Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman was born,” he recalled.

You practice a lot at night till your throat gets tired, and you go to sleep, when you record the next morning, your baritone opens up.”

We never crossed paths. So somehow that also helped in the performance. They are from NSD and I am from the K3G school of acting.”

Karan said that he enjoys when he is hanging out with both Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani actors and said, “Adi becomes like the glorious, gorgeous punching bag because Ranbir believes he knows nothing about anything.

Though they didn’t spill major gossip, Aditya blushed and played it coy when asked about his rumored relationship with Ananya Panday. He didn’t confirm the rumor but praised Ananya.
On the show, Karan asked, “Rumour has it that you are dating Ananya Panday?” Aditya replied and said, “Karan, you said on your show, ‘Ask me no secrets and I’ll tell you no lies’. I remember this.” The filmmaker then told Aditya that Ananya said on his show that she was feeling “very Ananya Coy Kapur.” Replying to this, Aditya said, “And I am Aditya Joy Kapur as of now.” Karan countered his answer and said, “You mean you’re joyously in a situationship?” Aditya said, “I’m quite joyous.” He also said that Ananya is ‘bliss’ and ‘pure joy.’ A situationship is an undefined romantic relationship between two people that often lacks commitment.

Karan Johar says Deepika Padukone-Ranveer Singh’s trolling after ‘honest’ Koffee episode angered him: ‘Wanted to show trolls my middle finger’,"Karan Johar said that the reaction to Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's Koffee with Karan episode, where the couple spoke about their relationship, angered him.","Karan Johar started the current season of Koffee with Karan with a bang as he invited Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh to his couch and the couple opened up about their love story and relationship, and discussed details that they had never shared with the world before. But, the reaction to the episode from netizens wasn’t all that positive. Deepika specifically faced a lot of trolling after she said that she dated other people after meeting Ranveer.

In a chat with Aditya Roy Kapur and Arjun Kapoor, Karan said that he believed it to be one of the most “honest and heartfelt” episodes of all time but it had a “ridiculous kind of after effect.” “I think all three of us came clean on so much of our emotional heft, so many of our feelings and then there was a ridiculous kind of after effect,” he said. Karan explained that the reaction to this episode “angered” him because “I thought it was one of our best episodes. They were outstandingly honest, they were earnest, they spoke so much, they shared so much, they were so gracious and then you f**king talk about some nonsense. I’m like what do you know about somebody’s personal life and marriage. Tu apne ghar pe dekh na (Look inside your house) is what I wanted to tell all of them. I wanted to show them my f**king middle finger.”

Kevin Hart and Chris Rock Headliners Only movie review: Netflix’s humourless profile of comedy icons is strictly for fans,Kevin Hart and Chris Rock - Headliners Only movie review: Netflix unites two (maybe three) of the biggest comics in the world for a short documentary that actively withholds the comedy.,"For such a minutely manicured piece of ‘content’, Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only certainly leaves a lot of wrinkles in plain sight. Whether or not this was by design is another argument altogether. The Netflix documentary is on the surface a noble effort to recreate the magic of The Original Kings of Comedy — Spike Lee’s seminal film that united four major Black comedians on the same stage over two decades ago — but despite a handful of moving moments, Headliners Only can’t help but feel like covert advertising for a special that Netflix hasn’t even announced yet.
Hart seems to be the orchestrator here. To prove that he doesn’t feel threatened by the far more accomplished Rock, he came up with the idea to do a one-week joint show at three different New York City locations. He even planned a grand gesture for the end. He’d call the unsuspecting Rock back up to the stage, and then present him with a live goat in front of 20,000 people. Because, he’s the GOAT. Get it? Even when he’s first narrating the plan (to Jay-Z of all people), you can’t help but wonder, “They know that this is a terrible idea, don’t they?” But Jay-Z seemed to be very impressed. He even got goosebumps just from listening to Hart’s narration, so what do you know?

"Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal isn’t about papa’s neglect, it celebrates the type of masculinity that makes our world unsafe","While Animal is all the buzz now, problematic parent-child relationships in Bollywood are common to the point of being cliched.","Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s latest offering Animal could well have been the title to a Kabir Singh sequel where he became wealthy and then lost his wife Preeti. Instead, we have Ranbir Kapoor playing Ranvijay Singh Balbir, whose father Balbir Singh is called India’s wealthiest and most powerful man multiple times in the first half. But running a business empire across three time zones means he has no time for his family. In Vanga-land, this fractures his son’s psyche and turns him into a chauvinistic, sexist, bloodthirsty mass murderer. Single parents and families with fathers whose jobs separate them from their children for monetary reasons, you have been warned.
As I tried very hard to deal with the nausea I felt during the blood-soaked pre-interval sequence, I couldn’t help but think about three things- First, is Balbir’s absence a bigger crime than his wife and extended family’s wilful negligence of Ranvijay’s troubled behaviour? Second, while all of us carry some resentments, anger or trauma from our childhoods, just how many years can we blame our parents or our pasts for how we deal with the present and future? Thirdly, and most importantly, why does Bollywood find it so hard to present a parent-child relationship realistically? Though Animal was promoted as a father-son relationship carved in blood, it is a film where a man uses his troubled relationship with his father to give in to his latent psychopathic tendencies. But sadly, this is not the first time that we have seen problematic parent-child relationships on screen.

"‘Ranbir Kapoor’s eyes do the talking, Kangana Ranaut is very disciplined’: Animal, Tejas actor Anshul Chauhan",Anshul Chahuan was seen in Kangana Ranaut's Tejas that released two months before Ranbir Kapoor's Animal.,"Actor Anshul Chauhan, who recently appeared in Animal as Ranbir Kapoor’s character Ranvijay’s younger sister Roop, says she is still “coming to terms” with the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial. The actor reveals that when she was pitched the film, she wasn’t told the entire story and was only informed about her character and her scenes with the lead actor. Before appearing in Animal, Anshul had starred in Kangana Ranaut‘s Tejas, and the actor says she had “more expectations” from Sarvesh Mewara’s directorial as it was a “bigger and more powerful role”. She, however, is amazed how Animal took over and gave her more recognition for her work than any other projects she has been a part of.
In this interview with indianexpress.com Anshul opens up about her working experience with Kangana and Ranbir and how she is “still processing” Animal’s success and wonders why Tejas flopped.

When Ranbir Kapoor recalled how a mob of Russian fans carried Raj Kapoor’s car to his hotel: ‘Another kind of stardom’,"Ranbir Kapoor, who is witnessing major success with Animal, looked back in an old interview on the astronomical popularity that his grandfather, Raj Kapoor, enjoyed in his prime.","Actor Ranbir Kapoor is experiencing the biggest success of his career right now, with the controversial blockbuster Animal, but in an old interview, he appeared to have self-awareness about the kind of popularity he enjoys and the kind of cultural impact that his grandfather, Raj Kapoor, has had. He recalled an anecdote about his grandfather, and said that he can only dream of adulation on that scale. December 14, 2023, marks Raj Kapoor’s 99th birth anniversary.
Chatting with The Big Indian Picture over a decade ago, Ranbir was asked about earlier statements about wanting to become the biggest Indian star of all time. “I want to be the best at my job, not just critically acclaimed. I don’t want to do movies where just (people in) the cities know me. I want India to know me. I want to reach the small centres. I want to reach the small villages. If I’m a part of movies, it’s not just to make myself happy and intellectually masturbate, and say, ‘What a great performance, look at the nuances’. Unless every single individual in this country knows my name and likes me, I’ll never be a big star.”

Viola Davis joins the cast lending her voice to the character of the antagonist, Chameleon.","Get ready for an adrenaline-packed journey as the highly-anticipated trailer for Kung Fu Panda 4 has been unleashed, showcasing a thrilling battle between the iconic Dragon Warrior, Po, and his formidable new foe – a shape-shifting Chameleon, voiced by Viola Davis.

"Family movie review: Don Palathara’s stellar film exposes how family, religious institutions and society create a safe space for predators","Don Palathara's Family, starring Vinay Forrt, explores how families, the church and a conservative, close-knit society “facilitate” child sex abuse and how they create a safe space for predators.","Don Palathara is an expert in exploring and exposing the different shades of human behaviour. “Every edit is a lie,” cinema legend Jean-Luc Godard famously said once. In Don Palathara’s movies, we seldom come across a single character that undergoes edits or refinement. It appears as if each person is depicted in the most raw and unfiltered manner possible. They aren’t necessarily good or bad people; they can be both. Or, better to say that they are brutally and unapologetically themselves.
The filmmaker’s latest drama, Family, which premiered at the 52nd International Film Festival of Rotterdam (IFFR) and was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), too is a testament to this. Set in a quaint hamlet perched atop a hillock in the captivating landscapes of Idukki district, Family serves as an in-depth examination of the individuals in the community leading unassuming lives and also the closely-knit society they collectively form, where boundaries and personal spaces are nonexistent. The people, mostly following Christianity, are so interconnected that even the minutest events in their lives become common knowledge among all.

"How Shah Rukh Khan convinced Rakesh Roshan to cast him instead of Salman Khan in King Uncle, landed himself a three-film deal","Shah Rukh Khan was a newbie when he convinced Rakesh Roshan as to how it made business sense to cast him, instead of Salman Khan, in Jackie Shroff's King Uncle.","Shah Rukh Khan was still a newbie in the movie business when he landed a three-film deal with actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, as per his close friend and producer Vivek Vaswani. In a recent interview, Vivek recalled how Shah Rukh left Rakesh stunned with his knowledge of the business and landed a part in the promising movie King Uncle, which starred Jackie Shroff in the lead role. Not just that, he even got a three-film deal with the filmmaker’s company Filmkraft even though he had not appeared in even one movie until then.
In a chat with Film Companion, Vivek shared that he arranged for a meeting between Rakesh and Shah Rukh. Vivek was well aware that the role of Jackie’s brother in King Uncle was yet to be cast and he suggested SRK’s name for the same. When Rakesh met Shah Rukh, he asked the actor point blank, ‘Why should I cast you?’ Vivek recalled that he had coached SRK and explained him everything about the business and the actor just turned on the charm when he made his case. As per Vivek, the role that Shah Rukh wanted was going to be offered to Salman Khan who was already a star at that time.

"Suniel Shetty says his work in movies has been ‘irrelevant since 2014’, humbly admits that he can’t sell tickets: ‘I messed up’","Suniel Shetty said that he is loved by his fans but somewhere along his cinematic journey, he made many mistakes which is why he knows that people won't go out to buy his tickets.","Suniel Shetty became an action star in the 1990s but in the last few years, the actor has been known for ageing gracefully and promoting a healthy lifestyle, instead of starring in movies. In a recent interview, Suniel spoke about the same and said that while he receives a lot of love from his fans, he also understands that they aren’t willing to spend their money to buy a ticket for his film. Suniel shared that he acknowledges the missteps he might have taken through his selection of movies and admitted that his work in movies has been irrelevant since 2014.
Suniel said that he made some changes in his career and moved away from the action genre after he realised that his movies might be working for the world but they weren’t necessarily working for his family. He shared with ANI, “Even though my films were working, when I came back home, the films didn’t work. After showing my parents the film, my wife and my daughter, they said, ‘Very good,’ and then they said, ‘Ramu Saridon hai toh de do ek (Give me a Saridon if you have one).’ I heard that. Yani sir mein dard hua hai bete ki film dekhke (That means they have a headache after watching their son’s film).”

Meghna Gulzar explains why Vicky Kaushal was her first choice for Sam Manekshaw: ‘He’ll give more than expected’,A viral video shows Sam Bahadur director Meghna Gulzar lauding Vicky Kaushal's unwavering dedication to his roles.,"Bollywood actor Vicky Kaushal initially collaborated with director Meghna Gulzar in her critically acclaimed 2018 film Raazi.

At the trailer launch, Meghna was asked if Vicky is her muse. Lauding his work ethic, she said, “I love him as a person and I love him as an actor and then you put him in the role of Sam Manekshaw, who I completely adulate. So, a lot of time when I was loving what he was doing, I was not sure that I am loving Vicky Kaushal the actor or I am loving what he was doing with Sam Manekshaw. Having said that, right from Raazi, when there is a character that you will know that this name will come to your mind, then you don’t think left and right. It happened with Raazi, it happened with Sam. Because I know that he will give more than what I am expecting. He will make it his own and that’s what exactly he has done.”

‘Animal isn’t an Angry Young Man movie’: Ram Gopal Varma explains why Ranbir Kapoor’s film can’t be slotted alongside Amitabh Bachchan’s hits,"Ram Gopal Varma said that it's a 'stupid argument' to say that cinema influences society, and noted that nobody turned into Gabbar Singh after watching Sholay.","Director Ram Gopal Varma joined the chorus of Animal defenders in saying that movies don’t influence society; it’s the other way around. He said that films were changing behavioural patterns of audiences, people would have become gangsters after watching Sholay. In an interview with News9 Live, he also said that the controversial Animal cannot be categorised alongside Angry Young Man films such as Deewaar and Agneepath.
“One of the most successful films of all time is Sholay. People loved Gabbar Singh. They saw it multiple times, mainly for Gabbar Singh. Gabbar Singh is evil. He cuts off the cops’ hands, he massacres his family. You’re basically creating entertainment. No one takes a film seriously. When you saw Mad Max, nobody started going on bikes in high speed. Sholay is the biggest hit; nobody became a dacoit. Because Satya worked, nobody became a gangster. It’s a stupid argument to say a film can influence. At most, it can influence clothes or hairstyle.”

Five First Dates movie review: A simple yet warm hat tip to the Before trilogy,"An interesting film adeptly exploring the life of a bisexual woman and the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, Five First Dates also serves as a warm nod to the Before trilogy.","Remember the first time you went out with them? Not those who turned you off instantaneously or the ones you found problematic or not worth a shot, but that one person or the ones who provided you with memorable first dates? Those moments of opening up to each other slowly, ensuring that there is no TMI, while also trying to understand their likes and dislikes, sharing the most basic of details about each other, and unexpectedly delving into serious topics in tandem.
Rinoshun’s first Malayalam feature film, Five First Dates, which was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), revolves around Shalini (Noila Francy) and depicts five different dates she went on at different points in her life, in a chronological manner starting from her college days. The film also traces her life journey, illustrating the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, with a particular focus on her gradual self-discovery and understanding of her sexual orientation.
Employing an episodic plot structure, the film begins by depicting Shalini in college, embarking on a date with a young man. Despite his regressive behaviour and offensive remarks that reveal his misogynistic and queerphobic views, Shalini, still in her “ideal girl” phase, remains somewhat naive. Even in the face of these remarks, she rarely confronts him and continues with the date. By skillfully setting a significant portion of this encounter in a park, Rinoshun also underscores the immaturity in Shalini’s thoughts and the overall nature of the date.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the contrary, her second date takes place in a parked car when she is older. During this segment, it becomes apparent that Shalini has gradually evolved and is almost the opposite of the person she was in college. Now, she smokes, emphasising that it is not an empowerment act but a personal preference. Shalini asserts that she smokes because she enjoys it, requiring no further explanation, thereby highlighting her enhanced understanding of gender politics. Although the man in this scenario appears more progressive than the first, making nonsensical statements like “the purpose of life is to procreate,” Shalini doesn’t hesitate to correct him with logical facts, a departure from her former self.

Her third date, on the other hand, is far more mature, taking place with a budding filmmaker inside his flat. They engage in conversations about a variety of topics, spanning books, films, philosophies, and life. While they generally share a similar perspective on life, particularly regarding marriage – both stressing that it’s not a priority – they also acknowledge and discuss their differences in a mature manner. Towards the conclusion, she even expresses the possibility of envisioning herself marrying him if necessary, highlighting the warmth she experienced in the company of such a sensible person.
Moving on to the fourth date, arranged by her family with a potential groom, it begins with her frustration over his tardiness. She explicitly states at the outset that she only agreed due to her mother’s insistence and plans to leave once they conclude the meeting. However, as the conversation unfolds, she finds him intriguing. Despite being quite different from her in nature, he avoids condescension or displaying a man-child attitude. When she asks how he would react if she discovers one day that she is interested in women, he responds supportively, encouraging her to explore her actual sexual orientation by going on a date with a woman. For an older Shalini, who has likely weathered life’s challenges and is no longer the completely rebellious person she once was, this date leaves a lasting impression. Towards the end of the episode, she even reflects on the entire date during the journey home, a rare occurrence in the film up to that point.
In the last episode, Shalini is depicted on a trekking date with a schoolteacher, Afreen (Pooja Sreenan), after discovering that she is bisexual. As they explore a forest together, Afreen reveals to Shalini that trees too communicate when we focus our ears on their trunks, emphasising that she is learning more new things in this relationship. Shalini appears to be at her happiest, relishing every moment of the date. Despite fatigue from walking, she persists, choosing to be with Afreen in the present. The film concludes with the two sharing a kiss atop a hillock, where Shalini, once comfortable with PDA, now shivers as their lips meet, highlighting the excitement Afreen brings. While all the other dates are set at night, the one with Afreen occurs during the day, with the sun shining above, symbolising how this relationship has illuminated Shalini’s life.

A hat tip to Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, Five First Dates even features a poster of Before Sunset on the wall in the filmmaker’s flat during the third date. An interesting film adeptly exploring the life of a bisexual woman and the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, Five First Dates ensures that the dialogues feel natural and not forced onto the characters.
Since the dates progress at a real-time pace, Rinoshun allows the actors to carry forward the moments without unnecessary interruptions. This approach extends to the inclusion of mispronunciations in the dialogues, permitting characters to correct themselves and proceed, adding an additional layer of charm to the movie.
On the performance front, Noila Francy shines exceptionally as Shalini, brilliantly capturing and bringing forth the different shades and ethos of the character at various junctures in her life. Noila even adds additional layers to the character at different points, emphasising Shalini’s growth and realisation, processing more things.
However, Five First Dates falls short on the technical side, as the film rarely explores anything visually beyond the characters, in contrast to the Before trilogy. While the limited budget may have constrained additional visual elements, better planning on Rinoshun’s part, considering his roles as cinematographer and editor, could have enhanced the film’s visual language. Simultaneously, the use of music and song placement proves to be a detractor, discordant with the film’s intended tone.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/five-first-dates-movie-review-a-simple-yet-warm-hat-tip-to-the-before-trilogy-9066376/,entertainment
Sandeep Reddy Vanga shut down Ram Gopal Varma’s theories about Animal and Godfather: ‘Haven’t read a single book in my life’,Ram Gopal Varma asked Sandeep Reddy Vanga if Ranbir Kapoor's character in Animal was inspired by how Sonny Corleone is described in The Godfather novel.,"Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who has been a vocal supporter of Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s controversial blockbuster Animal, said that he views the movie as a riff on The Godfather, but from Sunny Corleone’s perspective. In an interview, he also compared the movie to the films of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese, and said that he spoke to Vanga about a certain theory that he had about the movie, but Vanga shut him down in his own trademark fashion.
In an interview with News9 Live, RGV said that Animal reminded him of Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street. “The last film I saw where the director himself is not being judgemental about the character was Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprio’s character is immoral, he’s bad, and yet you’re fascinated to see him. I would like to think Animal is a mix of Scorsese and Tarantino.”

"Triptii Dimri defends Animal against criticism: ‘If certain things don’t suit you, don’t watch them’","Triptii Dimri said that she understands the pushback against certain scenes in Animal, but made it clear that nobody is being forced to watch the movie.","Actor Triptii Dimri, who appeared in a supporting role in the controversial blockbuster Animal, spoke about the portrayal of women in the film, and where she stands on her character, Zoya. She also touched on the divisive scene in which her character is made to lick the boot of Ranbir Kapoor’s Ranvijay, and offered her two cents on going from playing characters with agency in films such as Bulbbul and Qala, to playing a pushover in Animal.
In an interview with The Quint, Triptii was also quizzed about the impact that films have on society, and if there’s a responsibility that artists feel about what they put out into the world. Describing Zoya as ‘perfect the way she is’, Triptii said, “I see her as a very honest and sincere person, and I wouldn’t want to change a single thing about her.” Asked about the shoe scene, and whether it could influence minds, she said, “It depends on person to person. If you’re watching an action film, and the goons are beating up the hero, that doesn’t mean you go and beat up whoever you hate in life. Or, if someone is talking rudely to his wife or girlfriend, that doesn’t give you the license to go home and start talking the same way to your wife, or girlfriend, or whoever.”

"Bobby Deol says Abrar was supposed to kiss Ranbir Kapoor’s character in Animal climax scene, Sandeep Reddy Vanga removed it","Bobby Deol spoke about the undercurrent of love between his character, Abrar, and Ranbir Kapoor' Ranvijay in the climactic fight scene in Animal.","Actor Bobby Deol made some surprising revelations about the climactic action scene in his new film, Animal. The crime epic ends with his character, Abrar, fighting Ranbir Kapoor’s Ranvijay shirtless on an airstrip. In an interview, Bobby admitted that there is a love-hate dynamic between the two characters, which is reflected in certain creative choices that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga made in the movie.
Speaking to The Quint, Bobby also revealed a key moment that Vanga removed from the theatrical cut, but said that it could be included in the eventual Netflix release, which is expected to be even longer than the film’s current 201 minute run time. Recalling how Vanga described Abrar to him, Bobby said, “There are these two brothers, they want to kill each other, but there’s a love that they have for each other. I’m going to shoot the climax sequence with a song playing in the background, which is about love.”

"Bobby Deol defends marital rape scene in Animal, says Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film is ‘creating awareness’","Actor Bobby Deol spoke about the controversial marital rape scene in Animal, the film's negative reviews, and its perceived misogynist tone.","Actor Bobby Deol spoke about the controversial marital rape scene in his new film Animal, and said that it was absolutely necessary. Much has been said about the film’s depiction of toxic masculinity, and its apparent glorification of misogynist behaviour. Previously, Bobby’s co-stars in the film Triptii Dimri and Mansi Taxak, also spoke about some of its most controversial moments.
In an interview with The Quint, Bobby said that he doesn’t pay attention to reviews – Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, has been trashed by critics – because they’re a ‘waste of energy’. He also said that he doesn’t view his character Abrar as a villain at all. Asked about the marital rape scene in the film, Bobby became flustered and said, “I’m not trying to promote anything. Yes, it was required. How do you showcase a character in such a short span, show what this man is capable of, what kind of person he is? All these scenes were required.” When it was pointed out that films have the power to influence the masses, and that the masses already worship movie stars in India, Bobby said, “We are influenced by what is happening in society as filmmakers. What is written, as a story, is an influence of what is happening in society. It exists in our society. We are not promoting it. We are actors, portraying characters, entertaining people. And if that was the case, this film wouldn’t be a big hit.”

"Most-watched Indian content on Netflix: Rana Naidu is number one, Chor Nikal Ke Bhaga and Mission Majnu take second and third place","Netflix's data dump reveals that Indian titles on the platform were non-competitors for the top spots, were generally poorly reviewed, and mostly Hindi-centric.","Netflix on Tuesday made public its most transparent viewership figures yet. The streamer had previously been reluctant to share data with the public and the investors, mainly to avoid letting the competition in on trade secrets. But after this year’s SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, which predominantly focused on revenue sharing in the age of secretive stats, the company has unveiled figures for more than 18,000 titles – both films and shows – on the platform.
The list skewed in the favour of long-form content, mainly because the rankings have been organised on the basis of total hours viewed. The report, titled What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report, covers titles that got more than 50,000 combined viewing hours on Netflix from January to June 2023. The list was topped by the first season of The Night Agent, which raked in a total of more than 800 million viewership hours. The second season of Ginny & Georgia took the second spot with 665 million hours. But while a handful of international titles found spots in the top 10, the most-viewed Indian title was Rana Naidu, which took the 336th spot, with 46 million hours viewed.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor Andre Braugher dies at 61,"Andre Braugher, popular for his roles on the series Homicide: Life on The Street and Brooklyn 99, passed away on Monday.","Andre Braugher, the Emmy-winning actor best known for his roles on the series Homicide: Life on The Street and Brooklyn 99, died Monday at age 61.
Braugher’s publicist Jennifer Allen told The Associated Press the actor died after a short illness.
The Chicago-born actor had his breakthrough role in 1989’s Glory, starring alongside Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won an Oscar for the film about an all-Black army regiment during the Civil War.

Despite the part, he told The Associated Press in 2019 that he struggled to find work in Hollywood where roles for African American actors were “few and far between. Period.”

But he would establish himself with the role of Det. Frank Pembleton, which he would play for seven seasons in Homicide: Life on the Street, a gritty police drama on NBC based on a book by David Simon, who would go on to create The Wire.
He would win his first career Emmy for the role, taking the trophy for lead actor in a drama series in 1998.
He would win his second for lead actor in a miniseries or movie for the 2006 limited series Thief on FX. Braugher would be nominated for 11 Emmys overall.

Years later he would play a very different kind of cop on a very different kind of show, shifting to comedy as Capt. Ray Holt on the Andy Samberg-starring Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It would run for eight seasons from 2013 to 2021 on Fox and NBC.
Though he’d dipped his toe into comedy in the TNT dramedy Men of a Certain Age, Brooklyn Nine-Nine still represented a major shift for Braugher, known for acting in dark and heavy dramas.
“I just felt as though it was an opportunity to do something strikingly different from the rest of my career,” Braugher told the AP. “I like it because it simply opens up my mind and forces me to think differently. So I think I’ve become much more sort of supple as an actor, and more open to the incredible number of possibilities of how to play a scene.”
He would be nominated for four Emmys during the run.

He was married for more than 30 years to his Homicide co-star Ami Brabson. They had three sons.
His death was first reported by Deadline.

His inspiring journey -- from Solapur to Mumbai.  ","In Talegaon, a small town in Maharashtra nestled between Pune and Lonavala, Avinash Arun read an interview of filmmaker Subhash Ghai, who he was a huge fan of. It mentioned that the filmmaker was a student of Film and Television Institue of India (FTII) and Avinash, who was in his mid-teens, was informed by his father that it was the place where movie makers were crafted. He was fascinated.
Years later, when he told his father, a cotton mill worker, that to get into FTII he needed to make a short film, his father took out Rs 50,00 from his provident fund and handed it to him. It was the first film that Avinash was producing, but it never got made and he lost all the money. “My father didn’t say anything, he was happy that his son at least tried. That’s really the origins of my story,” says Avinash Arun, a now accomplished filmmaker whose works like Killa, Paatal Lok and the recent Three of Us have created a gentle splash in the Mumbai film industry.

Leave the World Behind movie review: Julia Roberts’ apocalyptic thriller is more jaded than jaw-dropping,"Leave the World Behind movie review: Lofty ideas are undermined by a leisurely pace in director Sam Esmail's speculative thriller, starring Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke and Mahershala Ali.","There’s a sense that everybody involved with Leave the World Behind, the new apocalyptic thriller on Netflix, wants a pat on the back for asking the Big Questions. Not content with merely making its point, delivering the requisite thrills and moving along, Leave the World Behind seems to suffer from a near-constant inferiority complex, as if being a B-movie isn’t enough. In its desperation for prestige — director Sam Esmail gives himself the rather narcissistic ‘written for the screen and directed by’ credit — it sacrifices the pulp at its core.
It’s never really clear if we’re meant to take anything in it seriously. The tone is borderline ridiculous when it isn’t super-serious — there’s no in-between. Julia Roberts plays Amanda, a misanthropic middle-aged woman who drags her husband, Clay (Ethan Hawke), and their two kids, for a weekend getaway in the countryside. As it turns out, they picked the perfect time to rent out a luxury home in the middle of nowhere, because mere hours after they’ve settled in, the world seemingly ends.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/leave-the-world-behind-movie-review-julia-roberts-apocalyptic-thriller-netflix-9064945/,entertainment

In a recent interview, the actor revealed that he wasn’t the first choice to play the cruel father, Bhairav Singh, in the film. Instead, he was initially cast to play Ram Kapoor’s role. However, due to certain circumstances, he ended up in the role of Bhairav Singh, earning him a lot of praise.
Speaking on Lehren Retro, Ronit recalled, “I don’t think Vikramaditya Motwane saw anything in me. I wasn’t cast for the role of Bhairav Singh. I was cast in Ram Kapoor’s role of Jimmy. The actor who was initially playing Jimmy backed out, so I was called to play that role. Then the actor who was playing Bhairav Singh’s role also backed out. Then Anurag asked me to play the role of Bhairav Singh. Him and Vikram would have had a conversation. I just came home from a shoot at 4am and at around 7:30 am, my wife woke me up and told me that Anurag was waiting outside. He told me, ‘You are doing Bhairav Singh.’ I never asked what transpired. They moved me to play Bhairav Singh and brought in Ram to play Jimmy.”

‘Sandeep Reddy Vanga is highly commercial version of Anurag Kashyap’: Ram Gopal Varma calls Animal the most original film in Indian cinema history,Ram Gopal Varma said that Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Anurag Kashyap have more in common that one might assume.,"Director Ram Gopal Varma dismissed the suggestion that he brought about a revolution in Hindi cinema, and said that he was only playing around with established templates But he credited Sandeep Reddy Vanga of having achieved something truly original with his new film, the blockbuster Animal. In just over 10 days of release, the film has made nearly Rs 750 crore worldwide, and has emerged as the biggest A-rated movie in the history of Indian cinema.
In an interview with News9 Live, RGV was asked if Vanga can be described as his true successor, or if his successor has been Anurag Kashyap all along, seeing as how they’ve shaken up the film industry. RGV said, “I would think Anurag is closer to Sandeep. To say it in a cliché, I think Sandeep is a highly commercial version of Anurag Kashyap. The darkness of the characters, the very in your face… It’s something I’ve never done.”

When Karan Johar ‘wanted to murder’ Anushka Sharma’s career before it even began in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi: ‘After seeing her photo…’,"As Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi turns 15, we recall the time Karan Johar sabotaged Anushka Sharma's career before it even began and how Aditya Chopra stood firm on his decision to release the film two weeks after the 26/11 terror attack.","In 2007, Aditya Chopra, the chairperson of Yash Raj Films (YRF), found himself in a challenging situation. Despite the success of blockbusters like Fanaa and Dhoom 2 in 2006, YRF encountered a series of failures with films such as Ta Ra Rum Pum, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag in the subsequent year. The lone success for YRF in 2007 was Shah Rukh Khan’s Chak De India.
The misfortune continued into 2008, starting with the highly anticipated yet underwhelming film Tashan, which got more attention for Kareena Kapoor’s size zero than the film itself. Other releases like Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic and Roadside Romeo failed to reverse YRF’s fortunes. Though the success of Bachna Ae Haseeno provided some relief, it wasn’t enough to recover from the losses of the past two years.

He also advised actor-son Tiger Shroff to ""take it easy"".","Veteran Bollywood star Jackie Shroff says he has advised actor son Tiger Shroff to “take it easy” as film business is unpredictable. Tiger emerged as an action hero following the box office success of films such as Heropanti, and Baaghi.

“I think he (Tiger) needs a good technician and a good release. That’s it. The boy has everything, he is an action star. At his age, he is the biggest. I say, ‘Take it easy, some films will work, some won’t work, again some will work. This is life’.
“I’ve done 250 films and not all of them have worked. So, it’s alright. It (film) totally depends on the whole team, it (filmmaking) is a team work,” the 66-year-old actor, known for movies such as Karma, Ram Lakhan, Parinda, and Border, told PTI in an interview.

The actor, who currently stars in the movie Mast Mein Rehne Ka, said one has to be appreciative of all that they have accomplished, a formula that he lives by in his life.
“Everybody will not get everything in life, it is impossible. So, one has to understand that health, family and friends are important. We should have gratitude for whatever we have. I was happy selling peanuts, then sticking posters on the walls, working in a travel agency, modelling and acting in films, and now I’m happy planting plants,” he said.
Jackie Shroff said he never viewed any work as small. He started with odd jobs before making his acting debut in the 1982 Dev Anand film Swami Dada, in which he played a small role. It was Hero, directed by Subhash Ghai, which catapulted him to stardom.
“Whatever work I’ve got, I’ve always done that. Like, I remember selling peanuts first, then I got the job of sticking movie posters on the walls, I worked at a garment shop, then joined a travel agency. Then someone asked me, ‘If I would do modelling?’, I did it, then it was like, ‘Will you do a movie? I did it.
ADVERTISEMENT
“So, I kept myself open to doing all kinds of things. I was always sincere and disciplined, whatever work I was given, I did it honestly. I just kept moving and never stressed about anything.”
Mast Mein Rehne Ka, also starring Neena Gupta in the lead, is a poignant tale of urban loneliness. It was released on December 8 on Prime Video.
The film is written and directed by Vijay Maurya, best known for penning dialogues for Gully Boy, and Darlings among others. Mast Mein Rehne Ka is based on universal themes of second chances in love and life, forgiveness, and redemption. Jackie Shroff said he resonates with the idea of Mast Mein Rehne Ka in life.
“People often don’t take me seriously, some people laugh at the things that I do, some think I’m funny, and some are like, ‘he says anything’. But there are people who are like, ‘One should live life this way’.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I don’t know any other way but that you just have to be happy, spread happiness, and lead a life that is beautiful. Mast mein raho, there will be tension in life,” he added.
Mast Mein Rehne Ka is produced by Payal Arora and Maurya under their banner Made in Maurya.

Citing the example of Ranbir Kapoor’s recently released film Animal, the filmmaker said that despite the backlash the movie is getting, it has also started a more impactful conversation around misogyny than any other film could.
In a conversation with OTTPlay, Anurag said, “You cannot force responsibility on anyone. People take responsibility for themselves or they don’t. How many people went and watched a film that you considered to be feminist? Only a handful of people watch them and underline if it was a real feminist film or a pseudo-feminist film. A film like Animal has galvanised more feminists in this country than any other feminist film. It has created more discussion around misogyny than any other film. So it is doing something good.”

Happy Birthday Rajinikanth: A look at how Jigarthanda DoubleX paid a perfect tribute to the first dark-skinned star of Indian cinema,Karthik Subbaraj's Jigarthanda DoubleX has brought back a significant fact to the fore: Rajinikanth is the first-ever dark-skinned star of Indian cinema.,"Besides restoring Karthik Subbaraj’s position as a top Tamil cinema director, his latest venture Jigarthanda DoubleX has brought back a significant fact to the fore: Rajinikanth is the first-ever dark-skinned star of Indian cinema. Karthik, a self-proclaimed fanboy of the Superstar, thanked the actor even in the title card of the film. On top of that, the movie itself is a brilliant ode to Rajinikanth, who broke several norms of Tamil cinema back in the 80s when he emerged as the hero.
Jigarthanda DoubleX, a prequel to Karthi’s sophomore film Jigarthanda, is about Allius Caesar (Raghava Lawrence) a gangster in Madurai, who after an embarrassing incident at a party, resolves to become a hero. A contemporary fair-skinned actor Chinna (Arvind Akash) notes that it is impossible for Allius to become a star in Tamil cinema, where the tone and looks decide everything. Allius is a ruffian with a menacing demeanor which works for his illegal smuggling activity, but he doesn’t know how it is going to lend itself to his silver-screen aspirations. Enters Ray Dassan (SJ Suryah), a pretend-filmmaker, who is forced on a mission to kill Allius. Ray Dassan, in reality, is a coward, who is sent to jail on false murder charges. To get his freedom, he has to kill Allius. The film takes a huge turn post-interval when Ray convinces Allius to move to his tribal village.

At a particular moment in the film, Allius is asked to speed up the filmmaking as there is a debutant named Rajinikanth, who seems to have grabbed eyeballs with his debut film Apoorva Raagangal (1975). If Allius plans on becoming the first-ever dark-skinned hero, he has to beat Rajinikanth to it. At the surface level, this might just seem like a small hat tip to the Superstar, but the politics behind the ascent of both Allius Ceaser in Jigarthanda DoubleX and Rajinikanth in real life are perfect underdog stories.
ADVERTISEMENT
It has to be noted that before Rajinikanth, there were hardly any dark-skinned actors in the industry. The few that were there often got relegated to villain roles or worse as hitmen of the villain (Pa Ranjith hit out at this by titling his film with Rajinikanth as Kabali, a name generally used for such henchmen). When filmmaker K Balachander, an iconic figure in Tamil cinema, decided to introduce this rather unique youngster in Apoorva Ragangal, he decided to name him after a colour–Rajinikanth, the colour of the night. Not just his name, but his skin complexion would become the subject of numerous jokes and comments in the films that followed. Even in Apoorva Ragangal, his current box office competitor Kamal Haasan calls him a beggar.
Like a lot of dark-skinned actors, Rajinikanth quickly got a lot of antagonist roles like Parattai in 16 Vayathinile. Even the name Parattai loosely denotes a ‘unkempt’ ruffian. Rajinikanth gradually transformed himself into this hero with grey shades, a characteristic that’s explored even now by the new-gen filmmakers. Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is set to direct the actor in Thalaivar 170, said he wants to explore the dark side of the Superstar. That’s another convention Rajinikanth broke. When everything was in black and white in the mainstream, the superstar often played characters in films like Polladhavan, Billa, and Netri Kann that were unbecoming of a hero. After all, Rajinikanth is the one who made smoking cool in Tamil cinema, when it used to be the symbol of the villain.
His colour has continued to be the talking point of many of his films like Sivaji, where his love interest tries to dismiss him for his skin colour. In Pa Ranjith’s Kaala, the colour was discussed in all seriousness. “Karuppu uzhaipoda vannam (Black is the colour of proletarians),” proclaims Kaala. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth is seen only in black, a trait that is seen in the members of Dravida Kazhagam, a political movement founded by Periyar. Rajinikanth’s on-screen image will always remain black. And one owes it to Karthik Subbaraj to remind the new-gen about what it must have been like for Rajinikanth back in the 70s.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/rajinikanth-a-look-at-how-jigarthanda-doublex-paid-a-perfect-tribute-to-the-first-dark-skinned-star-of-indian-cinema-9063782/,entertainment

"Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods","2024 Golden Globe nominations: In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Air, American Fiction, The Holdovers, May December and Poor Things.","Greta Gerwig’s Barbie dominated the Golden Globe Awards nominations with nine nods for the blockbuster film, including best picture musical or comedy as well as acting nominations for Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and three of its original songs.
It was closely followed by its release date and meme companion Oppenheimer, which scored eight nominations, including best picture drama and for actors Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.
The revamped group, now a for-profit endeavour with a larger and more diverse voting body, announced nominations on Monday for its January awards show, after scandal and several troubled years, including one without a broadcast. Cedric the Entertainer and Wilmer Valderrama presided over the announcements from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the show will also take place on January 7.

Films nominated for best motion picture drama included Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest.
In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Air, American Fiction, The Holdovers, May December and Poor Things.
Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon both received seven nominations each. Poor Things saw nominations for Lanthimos, its actors Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Tony McNamara for screenplay and Jerskin Fendrix for score. Killers of the Flower Moon got nods for Scorsese, for direction and co-writing the screenplay with Eric Roth, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro.
Barbie tied for second-most nominations in Globes history with Cabaret, from 1972. Robert Altman’s Nashville remains the record-holder with 11 nominations. It went into the morning as a favorite top, and got a big boost from its three original song nominations, including “I’m Just Ken,” and one of the year’s new categories, recognizing cinematic and box office achievement.

Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.
The box office achievement category nominated eight films, including Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Oppenheimer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Mission: Impossible -Dead Reckoning, John Wick: Chapter 4” and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Several years ago the Oscars attempted to add a similar “popular film” category, but it proved to be an immensely unpopular decision and was scuttled amid backlash.
As always there were some big surprises, like Jennifer Lawrence getting nominated for her bawdy R-rated comedy No Hard Feelings for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy. She was nominated alongside Robbie, Stone and Fantasia Barrino (The Color Purple), Natalie Portman (May December) and Alma Pöysti (Fallen Leaves).
The Color Purple was widely expected to do better with the Golden Globes. The adaption of the stage musical got only two nominations total for Barrino and Danielle Brooks for her supporting performance.

WHAT’S NEW WITH THE GOLDEN GLOBES?
ADVERTISEMENT
The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which votes on the awards.
Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of color to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew.
In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. In mid-November, CBS announced that it would air the ceremony on the network on January 7. It will also stream on Paramount+.
WHAT ARE THE GLOBES KNOWN FOR?
The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars.
ADVERTISEMENT
The show was touted as a boozy, A-list party, whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their academy counterparts. It also only honored the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of shorts no one has heard of.
But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favor and win votes.
Some years, the HFPA were pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big name talent with hopes of getting them to the show, the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television.
Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, it was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers to the broadcast. This year, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.
WHO VOTES ON THE GLOBES?

The group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.

Lalit Pandit says K3G title track was a difficult task because Karan Johar wanted a song for both god and Amitabh Bachchan: ‘It can’t be simple bhajan’,Lalit Pandit revealed that the title song of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham was the most difficult to compose and revealed that Karan Johar had specific demands.,"Filmmaker Karan Johar’s Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham remains a timeless classic. Besides the amazing cast, the songs are still fan favorites. Think about the scene where Shah Rukh Khan lands at his home in a helicopter, and Jaya Bachchan’s character senses her son’s arrival, and the title song starts playing in your head. Ever wondered how they made that song? Lalit Pandit, the composer, recently shared that director Karan Johar’s request was unique – he wanted a bhajan for that moment. The title song of the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham was composed by Jatin-Lalit.
In an interview with Rajshri Unplugged, Lalit said, “The most difficult song was the one which looked very simple. It was the title song of the film. Because Karan’s brief was very difficult to comply with. He wanted a bhajan. Bhajans usually have a simplistic tune, it cannot be orchestrated as a huge song. But he did not want that. He wanted a song that Jaya ji is singing for god, Jaya ji is singing for her husband, so it needed to imply both.”

Prem Chopra on Animal co-star Ranbir Kapoor: ‘He has done a great job….It is a very difficult and complicated role’,"Prem Chopra, who embodied evil men of all shades in the films of the 70s and 80s, is being praised for his guest appearance in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal.","Villains make the narrative interesting but unlike the black and white portrayal of negative characters in the past, they are given a backstory in cinema today, says veteran actor Prem Chopra.
The 88-year-old actor, who embodied evil men of all shades in the films of the 70s and 80s, is being praised for his guest appearance in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal. Chopra said the negative characters were not justified in movies earlier and gave the example of his 1973 hit Bobby. Directed by Raj Kapoor, the film starred Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia in the lead.
“In those days, we were stamped as the bad guys… It was in a straight way, whether Prem Chopra, Amrish Puri, Pran sahab or anyone else, it was like, ‘Yeh gadbad karne wale hain’ (people knew that we were up to some mischief),” the veteran actor told PTI in an interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Like, in Bobby, I just had one dialogue and that became very popular. Raj (Kapoor) didn’t have to explain. People knew that he was going to do something,” he said, recalling his most famous dialogue, “Prem naam hai mera, Prem Chopra”.
But in Animal, Prem Chopra said a reason has been given for Ranbir Kapoor’s revenge in the film.
“The narrative was made interesting because of the negative characters (in the past). It is the same even now. They are a very important part of the film. Now-a-days, the difference is every negative character has a reason, how and why he has become a villain.
“In Animal, there’s a reason why he (Ranbir) is like this and that’s because his father was shot and he had to take revenge,” the actor said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Directed by Vanga of Arjun Reddy fame, Animal showcases a violent world set against the backdrop of a troubled relationship between Ranvijay and his father Balbir Singh, played by Anil Kapoor.
Prem Chopra, whose career has spanned 60 years that saw him feature in many prominent movies such as Do Raaste, Purab aur Paschim, Teesri Manzil, Kati Patang, Souten and Trishul, plays the role of the elder brother of Ranbir Kapoor’s grandfather
The cinema veteran believes the audience has become more appreciative of a good performance, regardless of a positive or a negative role.
“People have become emancipated, they appreciate it if you give a good reason. Sometime back, people were not able to adjust to the actors who were playing the negative characters.
ADVERTISEMENT
“When a person (who generally plays a) negative character is playing a positive character, they had doubts. In Hollywood, the actors are accepted in both (kinds of) roles, total negative or total positive, the performance matters. TV and all that (referring to OTT platforms) have made them (the audience) more literate about these things,” he observed.
The actor also praised Ranbir Kapoor for his performance in the action drama. Animal marks the second collaboration between the duo after the 2009 comedy-drama Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year.
“Ranbir is a very hardworking actor and performed so well in Rocket Singh. In this film (Animal), he is tremendous. He has done a great job. It is a very difficult and complicated role.
“It is action-oriented but even then, his character has a great background (story). People seem to love him very much. Not just him, even Bobby Deol is very good in a special appearance. All of them are very impactful.”
ADVERTISEMENT
In movies, Prem Chopra has worked with four generations of the Kapoor family — from Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, and Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranbir Kapoor in recent years.
All his co-stars from the Kapoor clan are thorough professionals but his most-favourite was Rishi Kapoor, who passed away in April 2020 after a battle with leukemia.
“Some of them gave great performances, like, Prithviraj ji was known as the great actor, then Raj Kapoor was a known superstar and a genius director. Shammi Kapoor had his own style of working. But it was Rishi Kapoor I liked the most. He was very involved when he was working. He would fit into any character easily. He was a great asset to any film that he was working on,” he added.
The actor said he has experienced his fair share of highs and lows, but has managed to survive in the film industry.

“I’ve been in the profession for more than the last 60 years. I’m grateful to God. I’ve never been unfair with my work. Every film for me was a test. I’m very hardworking, honest, and determined. There have been a lot of embarrassments and controversies but you have to continue doing your work,” he said.
Going forward, Prem Chopra said he is looking forward to doing selective work, something like American icon Marlon Brando’s character in the Hollywood classic Godfather.
“I’m open to good roles. It has to be very selective,” he added.

"Bradley Cooper’s Maestro: A tale of music, marriage and multitasking","Maestro is a biopic on Leonard Bernstein, a celebrated U.S. conductor and composer, who wrote classical music and iconic hit musicals like West Side Story.","Co-writing, directing, producing and starring in his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro was a terrifying undertaking for Bradley Cooper that turned into a journey of joy and courage.
A passion project years in the making, Maestro is the follow up to Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star Is Born.
“In the beginning, realising how much work would be involved, I was terrified. But the more work I put in, and then each day, I became more and more at ease with the idea of being able to ask everybody to go on this journey,” Cooper told Reuters at the film’s premiere in London last week.
ADVERTISEMENT
“By the end of it, it was just joy and fearlessness.”
Leonard Bernstein, who died in 1990, was a celebrated U.S. conductor and composer, who wrote classical music and iconic hit musicals like West Side Story.
Maestro focuses on his relationship with his wife, Felicia Montealegre, played by British actor Carey Mulligan, and on his bisexuality.
“Lenny and Felicia were filled with a lot of passion and we were so excited that we were able to put our energy into a story about people that really loved life and lived life in such a dynamic way,” said Cooper.
ADVERTISEMENT
“At the time there was so much mutual love for them as a couple, everyone referred to them as Lenny and Felicia. It feels so appropriate that the film is their story and their love story,” added Mulligan, who said being directed by her co-star was her “favourite experience ever”.
“I’ve never experienced anything like it,” she said. “It didn’t feel like two separate things. There’s no acting required, you just are in the scene, I think that’s a testament to a truly great director.”
The children of Bernstein and Montealegre were closely involved in the development of the movie. Maestro was made for their family, said Cooper, and everything else, including Oscar talk, is extra.
“We had a really profound relationship with them throughout this whole experience. It really is about serving their parents in this art form and all this other stuff is awesome and it’s fun, but it has nothing to do with why we did it.”
Maestro starts streaming on Netflix from December 20.

"What Sandeep Reddy Vanga told Triptii Dimri about her Animal character Zoya: ‘You have a hidden motive, but keep it inside…’","Triptii Dimri shared that Sandeep Reddy Vanga told her that despite being planted as a mole for destruction, people should see innocence on her character Zoya's face.","Actor Triptii Dimri’s performance in the Ranbir Kapoor starrer Animal has been receiving love and praise, with many calling her as the new ‘national crush.’ The actor has now opened up about the brief given by director Sandeep Reddy Vanga for her character Zoya and how he guided her through the process. Triptii plays the role of Zoya, Ranbir’s girlfriend in the second half of the film, but her character takes an unexpected twist.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, when the actor was asked ‘what was the exact point when she fell in love with Ranbir Kapoor’s character?’ Triptii said, “There was no point as such. When we were discussing about what exact point she falls in love, there was nothing specific in anyone’s mind.”
Triptii then recalled the brief given by Vanga and said, “My director, he was giving me a brief; he said that, ‘You know it’s a negative character.’ ‘You’re going in with a motive, but keep all of it inside. On your face I want people to see innocence and love for this guy.  And, ‘Keeping all of those intentions inside, you have to go in.’ And, ‘We tried really hard to make sure that, you know, that comes through.’ And, ‘For me, I don’t think there was a particular point where she falls for him.’ ‘I think she just sees how, good he is.’ And, ‘She sees the good side of him.’”

Chamak: A middling mishmash that lacks punch,"What does make an impact is Chamak’s music and the range that it covers. From rap to folk to Sufi to a typical Punjabi film song, the music of the series is very carefully curated and produced. Every song comes from a deeper, interesting space and is worth a listen.","Distinctly inspired by the tale of slain folk singer Amar Singh Chamkila (also the subject of Imtiaz Ali’s upcoming film starring Diljeet Dosanjh), who was gunned down along with wife Amarjot in Punjab’s Mehsampur just before their performance, SonyLIV show Chamak opens with the shot of the fields, with men and women listening to local folk singer Tara Singh (Gippy Grewal) crooning a Punjabi ditty with his wife Navpreet by his side when the two are shot dead by two unknown men. The similarity of this one part of the story with Chamkila’s life is uncanny in Rohit Jugraj’s “work of fiction”, attempting to showcase the underbelly of the Punjabi music industry.
Cut to 20 years later, and one meets Kaala (Paramvir Singh Cheema), Tara Singh’s son, a Canada-based angsty musician with a bunch of criminal charges on him, who, while running away from the charges, comes to Punjab and discovers his provenance. He then decides to find his parents’ killers with the help of a retired journalist who once investigated the case.
Since Chamkila’s death in 1988, three conspiracy theories have done the rounds. These suppositions – that the musician was killed by those jealous of him in the music industry, that it was an honour killing by Amarjot’s family for marrying a man from the Dalit community, and the last being that it was a terrorist attack since his lyrical content was considered vulgar by many who supported and were a part of the then terrorist organisations. The same three theories form Kaala’s three possible explanations as he hunts for his parents’ killers.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the premise is well-known, the show is interesting because the hunt for answers remains. The first couple of episodes allow one to dive into the Punjabi music industry, shown with quite some authenticity – the diction and accents are spot on, and Manoj Pahwa’s Pratap Deol as the music mogul and Prince Kanwaljit Singh as a politician’s henchman are fabulous. But it’s Cheema’s Kaala, promising in the beginning with those big eyes and just the right look, who is completely lacklustre. He just doesn’t stick.
But what does make an impact is the show’s music and the range that it covers. From rap to folk to Sufi to a typical Punjabi film song, the music of the series is very carefully curated and produced. Every song comes from a deeper, interesting space and is worth a listen. The show also has guest artists, including Mika Singh, Asis Kaur, and Kanwaar Grewal, among others.
But the most ludicrous bit in the first season of Chamak is not the lip sync gone awry in a web series set against the backdrop of Punjabi music (actors lose lyrics, sargams and rhythms far too often). Things become notoriously dotty when a classical guru Jugal Brar (Suvinder Vicky) ties his student Kaala’s hands, and forces him to fill his mouth with marbles during his vocal riyaz. Besides the cruelty of the practice (also shown in The King’s Speech to cure the king of his stammer), I have never heard of it in the world of Indian music. Students always did sewa – domestic work among others (The Disciple portrays it to the tee) and even suffered much at the hands of gurus who were tyrants, but singing with a bloody mouth was definitely not one of them. Unlike his last outing, this time Vicky is lost among some better performances.

Another problematic bit is when the times one lives in today creep from the peripheries. In an achingly naive move, a dialogue – “Kesri rang chahiye, galti se bhi hara dikha toh gaal laal kar dene hain tumhare,” is quite disturbing.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the series does come close to portraying the complex music industry of Punjab, fraught with crime despite the existence of some of the brightest musicians, it lacks the substance and the gravitas to put a spotlight on this entangled entity. It ends up being a middling mishmash that lacks any solid punch.

Salaar trailer: Prabhas turns into one man army for Prithviraj,Salaar trailer: Prabhas plays the lead role in director Prashanth Neel's film Salaar. The movie will witness a big clash with Shah Rukh Khan's Dunki.,"The trailer of Salaar, starring Prabhas in the lead role, was released on Friday. Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, the film is less than a month away from its release. It also stars Malayalam star Prithviraj, Shruti Haasan, Jagapati Babu, Eshwari Rao, and Sriya Reddy.
In the 3-minute and 46-second-long trailer, we are given a glimpse of the city of Khansaar which is ruled by some dreaded crime lords. Jagapthi announces his wish of seeing his son Varadha Raja Mannar, played by Prithviraj, as the ‘lord’ of the city. But he has several enemies working against his wish. This is when Prabhas aka Deva enters the scene. Though he is accompanied by his army, the visuals of the trailer suggest he is the one-man army who can one-up the enemies.
Going by the trailer, Salaar promises to be as action-packed and bloody as director Prashanth Neel’s previous outings, KGF: Chapter 2 and KGF: Chapter 1.

Salaar’s teaser released in July and at the time, fans wondered if Salaar was in the same universe as KGF. Director Prashanth Neel has previously directed the KGF movies, starring Yash, which have been extremely successful all over the country. In fact, KGF Chapter 2, released in 2022, made over Rs 1200 crore at the worldwide box office and emerged as one of the highest grossing Indian films of all time.
This time around, Prashant’s film is going against Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Shah Rukh has had a stellar year at the movies and his films, Pathaan and Jawan, have collectively made over Rs 2000 crore at the global box office. Speaking about this clash, Prashnath had earlier told The Times of India that this was a “very unpleasant situation”.
For Prabhas, who is leading Salaar, this film will be a big test as he just faced a massive failure with Adipurush, where he played the lead role. In fact, his last two releases – Radhe Shyam and Saaho – also failed to impress the audience. Prabhas’ last big hit at the theatres was 2017’s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. After Salaar, Prabhas will be seen in Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD and Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Spirit.

During the interaction, Sandeep shared an interesting story about how he wanted to cast Nani as his hero in a soft romantic film. Sandeep was right out of film school and was looking for a direction opportunity. He got a chance to narrate a script to a producer. The filmmaker said, “I want to share one thing with you. In 2010-2011, I was out of film school and was working as an AD in a film. Then one producer asked me to tell a story. That time, I had seen one of your films called Ride. I have worked with theatre artists at film school and I have some experience. So, when I saw the film I was impressed by your modulation. I hadn’t seen your first film Ashta Chamma then. So, I was like, ‘Who is this guy… he has the modulation of a mass hero… has great expressions.’ So, I had this love story, I still have it. It is a nice soft love story. I narrated the story to the producer.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/sandeep-reddy-vanga-wanted-to-cast-nani-in-a-soft-love-story-but-producer-rejected-it-9050076/,entertainment

"Antony movie review: Joju George, Kalyani Priyadarshan film is let down by sloppy writing","Antony movie review: Despite having a plot that is bound to captivate Malayali audiences, Joshiy's film, starring Joju George and Kalyani Priyadarshan in the lead roles, falls flat due to sloppy writing.","Kauravar (1992) is arguably one of the finest gangster films in Malayalam cinema. But, what sets it apart is its compelling second half, where the narrative takes a turn, and the previously bloodthirsty gangster starts protecting the family of the man he initially sought to eliminate for ruining his life and the lives of his aides. The emotional depth conveyed in the story, crafted by AK Lohithadas, is executed with such mastery that Kauravar stands as a timeless classic, a testament to Joshiy’s filmmaking prowess. While navigating a complex narrative that intertwines elements of action and a father-daughter(s) tale, Joshiy ensured that every detail in the script seamlessly translated into the visual language.
Similarly, at its core, Joshiy’s latest film Antony too combines elements of action and a ‘father-daughter’ tale. But, did he succeed in creating another brilliant film this time? Let’s see.

ADVERTISEMENT
Set in a fictional place called Avaran City, the film revolves around the cold-blooded Antony Anthrapper (Joju George), the uncrowned king of the locality. But, what distinguishes him is his refusal to wield weapons for unjust causes. Despite being strong and remarkably courageous, he typically gets involved only in issues concerning others, especially the underprivileged, or when the ones who need to be taken on are exceptionally wicked. In the latter situations, he charges a substantial fee for his services.
The movie begins with Antony severing a rival’s leg, leading to the latter’s (unexpected) death and Antony’s subsequent six-month imprisonment. Upon his release, Antony reaches a settlement with the deceased’s wife Jessy (Asha Sharath), who had witnessed the incident, by paying her a significant sum. She is also relieved that her criminal spouse is dead. Meanwhile, Jessy is brutally murdered by her husband’s associates, leaving her daughter Ann Maria (Kalyani Priyadarshan) alone. As per the instructions of the local church priest and friend Fr Paul (Chemban Vinod Jose) and his godfather Avaran (Vijayaraghavan), Antony takes on the responsibility of looking after Ann. A firebrand boxer, Ann is a perpetual “problem-maker” at her college, for which Antony is now answerable, being her local guardian. Their inability to communicate with each other further complicates the situation. The remainder of the film unfolds as it delves into their challenging journey, while Antony’s enemies gear up to put him to rest.
Watch Antony trailer here:
Despite having a plot that is bound to captivate Malayali audiences, Antony falls flat pretty much from the start due to sloppy writing. Although the film has moments that could be impactful and/or stir a range of emotions, Rajesh Varma’s narrative remains mostly average. Even those moments, including massy and emotional ones, that are crucial for the film, fall short of evoking the necessary emotions due to the writing lacking depth. Even in the first act, where various characters are introduced, their veracity is lost owing to mediocre writing, and the makers’ attempt to compensate for this by using dialogues has in no way proven helpful. The character of Antony, too, doesn’t receive much depth in this portion, as the script’s sole focus is on repeatedly emphasising his lack of inhibitions.
As the story progresses, promising moments emerge, yet Rajesh Varma fails to effectively capitalise on any of them, leaving the overall narrative half-baked. This is especially noticeable when it comes to the antagonists. Despite the film introducing several villains and giving them extensive build-up, complete with slow-motion shots, BGM and sufficient motives to take down Antony, their characters fade away towards the end and the climax wraps up swiftly, leaving one to question why the villains received so much hype throughout the movie.

Amid the flaws in the writing, the film is somewhat saved by director Joshiy’s execution. While Antony may not stand out as one of Joshiy’s good works, let alone the best, his skill in the craft shines through. Right from the initial shot, the director ensures that his distinctive style is prominently displayed. Joshiy’s adept use of actors, focusing on their unique strengths, proves beneficial in Antony as well, particularly in the mass and action sequences. With Antony embodying both good and evil, Joshiy creates a visual space for Joju to bring out the character’s ethos in an honest manner. Simultaneously, the filmmaker also ensures that Ann Maria’s character isn’t merely depicted as someone living under Antony’s protection, giving her genuine agency and exhilarating moments. Despite these merits, the absence of compelling moments diminishes the impact of Joshiy’s efforts.
Though Joju George once again takes on a role that blends both good and evil with various shades of grey, giving the impression that he’s getting typecast, he delivers a strong performance nevertheless. Despite the character bearing similarities to his role in Joshiy’s Porinju Mariam Jose (2019), Joju ensures that Antony remains distinct, maintaining authenticity. His compelling on-screen rapport with Chemban Vinod Jose, who also delivers a commendable performance, adds warmth to the film. Despite an underdeveloped and poorly written character, Nyla Usha remains sincere in her portrayal of Maya, a home nurse; while Vijayaraghavan, as expected, excels in his role.

On the other hand, Kalyani Priyadarshan brings a refreshing performance here. While Ann Maria doesn’t fit the typical “cute girl-next-door” mould, Kalyani too ensures the character isn’t bubbly, a departure from her recent roles. She skillfully handles the action sequences as well, including those in the boxing ring, making them appear authentic.
While Renadive and Shyam Sasidharan perform decently well in their roles as cinematographer and editor, respectively, Jakes Bejoy, who won many hearts this year for several impressive tracks, falls short of expectations with the music in Antony.

Rishab Shetty denies criticising Rashmika Mandanna: ‘Finally someone understood what I really meant to say’,Rishab Shetty recently said he doesn't want to come across as an actor who left the Kannada film industry after one hit film.,"Ever since Rashmika Mandanna called off her engagement with Kannada star Rakshit Shetty and pursued her acting career that transcended Kannada borders, she has been receiving criticism for letting down her home industry. After the success of Geetha Govindam, Rashmika did more projects in other languages than in Kannada thereby receiving backlash from fans of Kannada cinema. It is said that there’s an ongoing feud between Rishab Shetty (who directed Rashmika in her debut film Kirk Party) and the Animal actor for the same reason. Now, a recent statement from Rishab was also perceived to be an indirect dig at Rashmika. However, Rishab has come out with a tweet to deny such allegations.
At a IFFI 2023 press conference held last week, Rishab said that he didn’t want to be the person who leaves the Kannada film industry after giving one hit. It was perceived as a dig at Rashmika, and an X user pointed out the same in a tweet. However, the fan faced severe backlash for misconstruing Rishab’s statement. He later corrected himself and apologised for twisting Rishab’s opinion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/rishab-shetty-denies-criticising-rashmika-mandanna-finally-someone-understood-what-i-really-meant-to-say-9049926/,entertainment

Bigg Boss narrator says people abuse him online for eliminating their favourite contestants: ‘They threaten my family’,"Vijay Vikram Singh, who is the narrator on Bigg Boss, said that he has faced a lot of abuse online in the last few years.","Bigg Boss is currently in its 17th season on television and while the show has a dedicated fan base but even after so many years, fans can’t comprehend that the voice artists involved in the show don’t decide who stays in the house. Vijay Vikram Singh, who is the narrator of the show and interacts with the audience, recently spoke to Bollywood Bubble and shared that in the last two years, he has faced many threats for him and his family after a popular contestant gets evicted. Vijay said that he is the second voice on the show, and not the one who interacts with the housemates.
“I have to tell people that there are two voices on Bigg Boss, they don’t believe me. I am the voice who interacts with the audience,” he said and clarified that his voice is the one that announces the time, and narrates the events to the television audience. “The voice that interacts with the contestants is a different voice.

Annapoorni movie review: Nayanthara-Nilesh Krishnaa serve a bland film,"Annaporni movie review: The biggest problem with this Nayanthara film is its melodrama. The exaggerated villain, on-the-nose symbolisms, and overloaded emotions are out of place in an otherwise sober story about ambition.","Annapoorni, a film about an aspiring chef with an incredible sense of taste and smell, doesn’t feature a single scene that makes one crave food. That could be because the focus is too much on Annapoorni (Nayanthara) and not her subject of obsession or the script. Amidst testosterone-heavy films that leave no room for any other, Nayanthara’s ascent as a ‘Lady Superstar’ with her own market is commendable, but it becomes a wasted opportunity when the actress also aims to ape ‘heroism’. Annapporni doesn’t feature Nayanthara sending off goons up in the air, but it does exalt its heroine and pitches her as the symbol of empowerment. Like our heroes, she gets an exaggerated and comical villain, who goes, ‘I love explosives,’ while playing a violent video game. These are the tropes that make our heroes redundant. Are these now prerequisites for ‘Lady Superstars’ too?

Director Nilesh Krishnaa has set his film in Sri Rangam, Trichirapalli, a temple town that’s called Bhoologa Vaikuntam (Heaven on Earth). Annapoorni is the daughter of the head cook in Sri Ranganathar Temple. Her father forsakes a promising career in Railways as an engineer because he considers serving Rangan (God) to be noble. Undoubtedly, he is great at making delicacies for the lord. Annapoorni grows up taking a lot of pride in her father and his cooking skills. On top of that, she has an enhanced sense of taste and smell that she can identify all the ingredients of a complex dish with her eyes blindfolded. All this makes her want to be a chef. While her orthodox Hindu family wants her to pursue an MBA, with some nudging from her childhood friend Farhan (Jai), she joins a catering course and pretends to her family that she is a management student at the same institution. Eventually, the truth comes out and she has to run away from Sri Rangam, calling off a forced wedding to pursue her ambition.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/annapoorni-movie-review-nayantharas-recipe-is-all-heart-and-less-brain-9049736/,entertainment
"Dunki Drop 3 ‘Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se’ features soulful Sonu Nigam doing what he does best, Shah Rukh Khan calls it his ‘favourite’ ","The third 'drop' from the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki is a new song, titled ""Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se,"" performed by Sonu Nigam, composed by Pritam, and written by Javed Akhtar.","Shah Rukh Khan on Friday ‘dropped’ the third piece of promotional material for his new film, Dunki. Fans have already seen a teaser for the movie, followed by a peppy number titled “Lutt Putt Gaya.” And now, they can soak in the sentimentality of Sonu Nigam’s vocals with the film’s second song, titled “Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se.” Sonu Nigam, once the foremost playback singers in Bollywood in the ’90s, became more selective in recent years, but has been slowly making a comeback to the mainstream, with numbers in films such as Laal Singh Chaddha, Shehzada and now Dunki.
The film’s soundtrack has been composed by Pritam. Lyrics for “Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se” have been penned by Javed Akhtar, and the song was first heard in the film’s teaser. It speaks about the journey that Shah Rukh Khan’s character and his friends go on in the film. Dunki tackles the subject of the mass migration of Indian youth to countries such as Canada and England. According to the press notes, the song adds “another layer of emotion” to the film, about the “heart-warming tale of four friends and their quest to reach foreign shores.” The song delves into the profound ache of yearning for one’s homeland, a sentiment that resonates deep within the hearts of those separated from their roots in pursuit of a brighter future.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga says he didn’t take controversy around ‘non-consensual kiss’ in Kabir Singh ‘seriously’,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga stressed that Kabir Singh isn't a misogynistic movie, and suggested that the controversy around it erupted because of only four or five people.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga appeared to be in no mood to discuss the criticisms leveled against his last film, Kabir Singh, as he prepares to deliver the biggest hit of his short career with Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor. Kabir Singh divided audiences, with a section of viewers calling out its glorification of toxic masculinity. But it emerged as a massive hit, grossing nearly Rs 400 crore worldwide.
In an interview with CNN-News18, Vanga was asked about a non-consensual kiss between Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani’s characters in that film, and said that he doesn’t take the controversy around it ‘seriously’. “I didn’t think much about it. I don’t think that Kabir Singh was a misogynistic film. Only four-five people felt offended, and created noise about it. I never took them seriously,” he said.

When he was told that it was more than just a handful of people who found fault with the film, Vanga added, “Four people wrote articles about it, and that inspired others to write more articles. Not more than 20 people in total, it was their point-of-view. We should not talk about all that, bhool jao Kabir Singh ko (forget Kabir Singh).”
ADVERTISEMENT
Both Shahid and Kiara have also defended Kabir Singh against criticism. In a chat with mid-day, Shahid called the movie ‘a dysfunctional love story between a very simple girl and a very talented, brilliant, aggressive disturbed, guy’. Kiara told Bollywood Hungama, “My opinion has always been very clear and for me deep down it’s a love story and the thing about love is that it’s the only thing that will allow you to forgive certain behaviours in life. Relationships are very complex and it’s very easy for a third person to say ‘get out of that relationship’. But for two people in that relationship, it is another complication altogether.”
A kiss between Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandanna’s characters in Animal, which seemed like Vanga’s answer to the Kabir Singh controversy, also generated conversation. The characters kiss each other as a sign of protest against their families, who disapprove of their relationship. Animal is expected to deliver massive numbers at the box office, and is currently aiming for more than Rs 100 crore globally on day one of release.

Karan Johar touched on the issue in a recent episode of Koffee with Karan, making a reference to comments by Gadar 2 director Anil Sharma. And now, producer Bhushan Kumar has weighed in on the topic, explaining how someone could get away with inflating box office numbers.
In an interview with CNN-News18, the T-Series head honcho said that everything he knows about this subject is based on hearsay, but noted that corporate bookings are the key factor in inflated box office figures. “I can’t speak for others, but I don’t believe in this, it’s made-up,” he said.

"IMDb declares Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan and Pathaan as 2023’s most popular films, ahead of Vijay’s Leo and Rajinikanth’s Jailer","Jawan and Pathaan have emerged as the most popular Indian films of 2023, as per IMDb.","The year 2023 is coming to an end and unlike the last few years, which did not see many Indian films working at the box office, this became the year when the audience was back in theatres after the pandemic. In 2020, when the theatres shut down due to Covid-19, movies started releasing directly on streaming platforms but after a few dull years at the box office, 2023 saw multiple big hits with Jawan and Pathaan creating history for Indian cinema.
As per IMDb, the list of ‘Top 10 Most Popular Indian Movies of 2023 (Theatrical)’ is led by Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan, which released in September, and has emerged as the biggest grosser of the year. Pathaan, which was the first big hit of the year, also starring SRK is the second on this list, followed by Karan Johar’s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, starring Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh.

"Animal box office collection day 1 early reports: Ranbir Kapoor’s epic poised to dismantle Pathaan’s opening day record, set to gross more than Rs 100 crore worldwide",Animal box office collection day 1 early reports: Ranbir Kapoor is all set to nearly double his previous opening day record with Sandeep Reddy Vanga's crime epic.,"Ranbir Kapoor is all set to deliver the biggest opener of his career with director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, which debuted in theatres on Friday to enthusiastic response from fans. The film is set to exceed all expectations on its first day of release, and according to industry tracker Sacnilk, it will deliver Rs 65 crore from India alone. Sacnilk is also predicting a global opening of more than Rs 100 crore, making it the third Bollywood film of the year to pass the coveted milestone on day one. Morning shows and afternoon shows on day one reported 46% and 54% occupancy.
Animal delivered one of the biggest pre-sales in the history of Indian films. The action-thriller sold nearly 5 lakh tickets prior to release day, finishing at the fifth spot on the all-time list after Baahubali 2, Jawan, Pathaan, and KGF: Chapter 2. The movie is also delivering tremendous numbers in the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regions, a sign of how strong Vanga’s fanbase is.

Furiosa A Mad Max Saga trailer: Chris Hemsworth goes over-the-top as he takes on Anya Taylor-Joy’s fierce warrior,Furiosa trailer: George Miller's Mad Max prequel film stars Anya Taylor-Joy as the younger version of the character played by Charlize Theron in Fury Road.,"Warner Bros has debuted the trailer for the upcoming Mad Max: Fury Road prequel film, whose title has now been revealed as Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. Starring Anya Taylor-Joy in the central role of a young female warrior who is abducted by an evil warlord in a post-apocalyptic world, the film serves as the origin story of Furiosa, who was first introduced in 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, in which she was played by Charlize Theron.
The trailer doesn’t reveal too much about the plot, but shows audiences how Furiosa was abducted by a character named Warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth under thick prosthetic makeup. The trailer also reveals that Fury Road villain Immortan Joe will make an appearance. But large portions of it are devoted to Hemsworth’s colourful performance, and the equally lavish visuals that director George Miller has created.

While the trailer doesn’t reveal too much action, which has always been the highlight of the Mad Max movies, it does promise a layered central performance by Taylor-Joy, whose star has been on the rise ever since she headlined the acclaimed Netflix series The Queen’s Gambit. Furiosa was written even before Fury Road, which served as the fourth film in the long-running action series, originally led by Mel Gibson.
Each movie in the franchise has been directed by Miller, who famously faced several setbacks while making Fury Road in Africa a decade ago. The film was marked by a difficult production, which saw stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron butting heads while dealing with a chaotic production in the desert. It was nominated for 10 Oscars and is frequently cited as one of the greatest action films ever made, but was declared a commercial underperformer despite delivering the best box office haul in the franchise’s history. Furiosa will be released in theatres in May 2024.

Imran remains best known for the romantic comedy Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na and the edgy crime comedy Delhi Belly, and looked back on both movies fondly. But he also didn’t sugarcoat his feelings about the film Luck, even as he admitted that he has gained a new perspective on the movie because of how others view it.
In an interview on the IFP YouTube channel, Imran said that he recently rewatched his past work, and was surprised to observe how progressive and actively non-toxic Jaane Tu and Break Ke Baad were. But he didn’t have too many kind things to say about Luck, which was released in 2009. He said that his resurgence began with an Instagram post about the film, and that he didn’t expect to get the kind of response that he did.

"Shah Rukh Khan holds his passport and charms the officer at airport security check, fans call King Khan ‘grounded’. Watch",Shah Rukh Khan waited patiently at the airport security check and was seen cracking jokes with the officer on duty.,"Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for over 30 years now and has been a star for a majority of that time. Despite being one of the biggest superstars of Indian cinema, and having all the perks that come with such stardom, SRK makes sure that he always comes across as humble. Recently, when the star had to take a flight out of the country, he held out his passport in his hand, showed it to the airport security as he chatted with the officer on duty, and patiently waited as the man in-charge checked all the details.
SRK was surrounded by fans and photographers at the airport and was traveling with an entourage which made sure that he wouldn’t get mobbed. As fans watched this video on social media, one of them said, “It is good that Shah Rukh Khan is waiting patiently as he is just an ordinary citizen at the airport. Such behavior also shows how grounded King Khan is.” Another fan wrote, “He’s a king who respects protocol n never breaks rules. Just out of the world.”

It gives me genuine, great pleasure to welcome him to the stage to receive yet another prestigious award,” the Basic Instinct star said in her remarks.

One of my screen idols is in the house, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Johnny Depp. My good sir, I’ve followed your work since Edward Scissorhands and What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. What an honour to be receiving this in your presence. Thank you for everything that you’ve unknowingly taught me about the craft, sir.

Candy Cane Lane movie review: Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through excruciatingly shallow Christmas comedy,"Candy Cane Lane movie review: With a charmless central performance by the once-hysterical Eddie Murphy, Prime Video's Christmas comedy is neither naughty nor nice.","Helmed by Reginald Hudlin, the journeyman director behind stoner comedies and serious biopics, Candy Cane Lane is what happens when the content funnel needs feeding but nobody volunteers to get their hands dirty. In moments like this, streamers tend to turn towards folks that don’t have a choice. There’s theoretically nothing wrong with producing movies like this; the algorithm will be satisfied, and subscribers will be duped (yet again). And in a matter of days, we’ll all pretend like this never happened. Everyone will get away, scot -free.
Candy Cane Lane is supposedly a Christmas comedy, but with zero laughs and a charmless central performance by Eddie Murphy, it fails to clear even the low bar that the genre has set for itself. The former megastar plays a middle-aged family man named Chris Carver, who looks forward every year to compete in a neighbourhood contest for the best-decorated house during the holiday season. His wife and three children are only mildly invested in this annual exercise, but entertain his enthusiasm because they’re nice people. In fact, the movie is so desperate to win the audience’s affection that it takes several short cuts before setting the plot in motion. Which is perhaps why Chris is fired from his job within 10 minutes.

Sam Bahadur review: Vicky Kaushal is spot on in an excessively declamatory film,"Sam Bahadur Movie Review: Vicky Kaushal wins you over by being spot on, eyes a-twinkle, moustache a-bristle. It’s hard to play a character so closely without becoming a caricature, but he becomes Sam Bahadur.","Vicky Kaushal’s Sam Bahadur Movie Review: There’s a point in the film when Sam Bahadur is striding away from his low-on-morale-soldiers, having delivered a rousing address. One of them looks at his departing back and says: ‘we’ve finally got someone to tell us what to do’. There’s not just admiration in his tone, there’s reverence in his eyes.
Sam Manekshaw’s colourful personality and dazzling career has long been begging for a biopic. Meghna Gulzar’s 150-minute film, which focuses on the high points of his personal and professional life, is as admiring and reverential as that soldier who comes on for a moment and then bows out, his job done. Some individuals easily lend themselves to admiring bio-pics, and Sam Bahadur’s fans were, and still are, legion. But the film suffers from being excessively declamatory, with the background music overpowering the momentous events and the towering individuals on screen: the only one who escapes this, and keeps standing tall right through the film is Vicky Kaushal In and As Mankeshaw. This is Kaushal’s most challenging role, and he plays it to perfection.

He told indianexpress.com, “Expectations are mammoth from Animal. Ranbir Kapoor has a penchant for starting big on non-holidays, which others can’t do even on holidays, so that’s clearly up his sleeve. Animal is a brilliant presentation and people are keenly looking forward to it.

If Animal performs well at the ticket counters, it will be Ranbir Kapoor’s second hit in a row after Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar.

After OMG 2 and Gadar 2 had the clash of sequels on August 11, Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal and Vicky Kaushal starrer Sam Bahadur are both releasing in theatres on December 1 st . While Sam Bahadur’s release date was announced a year ago, the makers of Animal chose the same date, raising quite a few eyebrows. Perhaps it was easier to compete with director Meghana Gulzar’s film than taking on Shah Rukh Khan’s film Dunki or Prabhas’ Salaar releasing later in the month.
Unfortunately, badly behaved men have always generated good results at the box office. Perhaps that’s why, in spite of the A rating and long running time, Animal has had a tremendous response ever since advance bookings opened and is currently miles ahead of Sam Bahadur in terms of projected opening day revenues. As per a post on Sacnilk Entertainment’s page on X, formerly Twitter dated November 29, approximately 5 lakh tickets of Animal had been sold through advance bookings indicating a possible opening day revenue of Rs 14 crores. Sam Bahadur in the meanwhile had managed to sell about 38,556 tickets indicating an opening day revenue of a little over a crore.

"‘Shabana ji is in shock, Kiara is traumatised’: Twinkle Khanna’s comments about Karan Johar being in love with her leave him speechless","Twinkle Khanna left the audience at her recent book launch event scandalised with her comments, as she interacted with Karan Johar.","Childhood friends Twinkle Khanna and Karan Johar made innocent barbs at each other at her book launch event in Mumbai recently, which made Karan wonder why he agreed to attend the event in the first place, and apparently left some of the other illustrious guests in the audience shocked. Karan began the interaction with a question about Twinkle’s decision to pursue higher studies as a middle-aged woman, which somehow ended with her joking about Karan’s sexual orientation.
“I partly went back to university because I was approaching 50. Age is definitely a mathematical problem, but it’s not a sum of division, where you’re reduced to a fraction of what you are,” Twinkle began soberly. Moments later, she was wondering how Karan could’ve been a ‘topper’ at anything, because she’s always thought of him as a ‘bottom’. She watched him squirm as her joke registered.

In a recent interview, the actor spoke about the time when she won the Miss Asia-Pacific pageant back in the year 2000. Dia shared that she never allowed anyone to “commodify or objectify” her and went against the grain when she chose to wear a one-piece swimsuit in the international pageant, which was an unpopular choice. Women participating in international beauty pageants were expected to wear two-piece swimsuits in the swimwear round.
Dia, in a chat with BBC Hindi, said, “When I participated in the international pageant, I was very uncomfortable wearing a two-piece swimsuit so I wore a one-piece swimsuit. No one before my year, or even after it had done this. It depends on your individual choice. No one can force you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.”

During interviews, he has been addressing various misconceptions surrounding the film that arose following the trailer’s release nearly a week ago. In one such interview, he addressed the viral scene featuring Rashmika Mandanna, where she is seen speaking to Ranbir Kapoor with clenched teeth.
Post the trailer’s launch, social media buzzed with memes, with some expressing difficulty in comprehending Rashmika’s dialogue. Explaining the scene, Sandeep told Indiatoday.in, “She was supposed to speak in a particular way because it’s a very emotional scene. I knew there would be a certain reaction to it. When someone is feeling a certain emotion, then they speak with their teeth clenched. I think keeping it in the trailer has only given it multiple views. When you see it as part of the larger scene in the movie, it will make more sense.”

"Karan Johar said ‘awful things’ about fellow directors, called them ‘obsolete fossils’: Twinkle Khanna claims that’s why he hangs out with Gen Z","Twinkle Khanna claimed that Karan Johar said 'awful' things about some of his fellow directors, whom he described as 'obsolete'.","Childhood friends Twinkle Khanna and Karan Johar bantered at her book launch event in Mumbai on Wednesday evening, not holding back from throwing sharp jabs at each other. While Karan joked that Twinkle loves listening to the sound of her own voice, Twinkle made fun of his dedication to learning the ways of the Gen Z by hanging out with people half his age. She humorously called him a ‘vampire’ who ‘sucks out the blood’ of young actors.
Karan has admitted many times that he befriends young actors in order to stay relevant. But at the book launch event, Twinkle claimed that Karan told her that he doesn’t want to end up like some ‘obsolete’ directors whom he described as ‘fossils’. She said, “I know that you are a big advocate of the youth, we’ve discussed how you stay relevant.” Noticing Karan making a face in anticipation of another joke at his expense, she continued, “No, don’t make that face. I’m not saying anything bad. You said you were immersing yourself among young people, which is why you love Shanaya, Anaya, Alia and Alaya…” Karan corrected her, and said that he’s actually friends with Ananya, and Twinkle replied, “You know Anayas as well.”

As Karan made a face again, Twinkle continued, “We had a very long conversation. We were talking about directors we can’t name, but he said that they’re obsolete, they’re fossils, he said all these awful things about them. And then he said, ‘You have to be relevant, that’s why I hang around with young people’. I said, ‘Yes, but I don’t like people, I can’t hang around with them’.”
Twinkle admitted that both she and Karan are ‘fossils’, because the world that they grew up in no longer exists. Karan has addressed his fascination with the younger generation, many of whom he invites on Koffee with Karan. He also spoke about the sort of clothes he started wearing some years ago, and attributed his loud fashion makeover to a ‘mid-life crisis’.

"Animal to overcome Ranbir Kapoor’s box office blues with Rs 100 cr global opening, Sam Bahadur to hold slow and steady","Animal's opening day box office collections look robust while Meghna Gulzar's Sam Bahadur, featuring Vicky Kaushal, is looking at a slower start.","Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol starrer Animal has dominated headlines ever since its teaser was released and from the way its advance booking is being reported, it seems it is all set to do the same at the box office. Ranbir’s films have had an inconsistent track at the box office of late. After the humungous hit Sanju that re released pre-pandemic, his releases  Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, Brahmastra and Shamshera received a mixed response from the audience. While Shamshera was panned entirely, Brahmastra pulled in the people but had a bloated budget of Rs 400 crore. Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar brought some relief with its decent earnings. However, the actoris expected to beat box office blues with Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, which is expected to open with Rs 100 crore globally.
Animal, scheduled to hit the theatres on December 1, is an intense crime saga which revolves around the complicated relationship between Arjun Singh (Ranbir) and his industrialist father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor). The cast also includes Bobby Deol as Ranbir’s mute nemesis who is enough to tempt the 90s kids to come to the theatres. Rashmika Mandanna, an actor with a good pull in the southern region of the country, plays Ranbir’s submissive wife. The film’s director Vanga carries weight as well.

"Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar movie review: Poetic and profound, the best Hindi film of the year","Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar movie review: Out on Mubi after playing at festivals last year, the Darbhanga-set drama is a technical and narrative marvel; an unmissable piece of filmmaking.","A delicately paced document of urban decay, a loving tribute to human resilience, and a last-minute rescue operation for a film industry drowning in a ditch of mediocrity, director Parth Saurabh’s Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is the best Hindi movie of the year. Released on Mubi, it tells the story of an eloped couple who return to their hometown of Darbhanga, as they reel from the financial aftershocks of the pandemic and hold on to the last vestiges of romance as practicality rears its ugly head.
Unlike most conventional films, Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is more interested in the moments after the drama. We never see how Sumit and Priyanka, played by the phenomenal Abhinav Jha and Tanaya Jha Khan, actually made their relationship work, much less how they managed to run away. Nor do we ever cut away to the disgruntled dad who is often mentioned through the course of the film’s lean, but thematically rich, narrative. We’re left to exist alongside Sumit and Priyanka, as they reckon with the magnitude of the decision they’ve made, perhaps having imagined an idyllic life together. Think of it as a feature-length expansion of the memorable final shot of The Graduate, in which Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross contemplate an uncertain future after getting married in a moment of mad passion.

Salaar director Prashanth Neel: ‘Amitabh Bachchan biggest inspiration for all my movies’,"Prashanth Neel, who is currently promoting Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, said his dream is to direct megastar Amitabh Bachchan in a movie.","No one portrays grey roles the way megastar Amitabh Bachchan does, says KGF director Prashant Neel, who believes all his leading men carry a bit of the superstar’s anti-hero persona in them.
Neel, who directed the pan-India hit KGF: Chapter 1 in 2018 and followed it up with KGF: Chapter 2 in 2022, is currently promoting Prabhas-starrer Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire that is set to release on December 22. Both the films are produced by Hombale Films.
“Amitabh Bachchan is the biggest inspiration for all my movies. There are a lot of movies that he did where he played the hero but he was also the villain. That’s a genre that was rarely seen post that period. The way he portrayed the greys, I don’t think anybody else did it,” the writer-director told PTI in an interview.

“He made villainy look heroic. So, I try to do that with my movies… I try to make my characters look as negative as possible, even the positive ones. The hero has to be the biggest villain of my movie,” he added.
Prashanth Neel said his all time favourite Amitabh Bachchan movie is the 1990 hit Agneepath, a revenge drama directed by Mukul Anand. The director said his dream is to direct the megastar in a movie.
“Before I die, I want to do a movie with Amitabh Bachchan. Being a student of cinema of the 70s, 80s and 90s, I can’t think of anybody else other than him. It’s my biggest dream to want to make a movie for Amitabh Bachchan. I’ve to make him the biggest villain of my movie. I would not make it another way. If he agrees to do something, it will be the biggest honour of my life.”
When asked if he would ever direct a picture in a genre other than action, Neel said he would be thrilled to try something different.

“It becomes monotonous for anybody to do something like that, you want to move away from a genre,” he added.

"Love Hostel: Bobby Deol went Animal-mode in Shanker Raman’s slept-on thriller, and nobody noticed","Post Credits Scene: Ever since his comeback half-a-decade ago, Bobby Deol has almost exclusively been playing negative characters, to mostly disappointing results. There is, however, one outlier in his recent resume: Shanker Raman's romantic thriller, Love Hostel.","In the fine tradition of films like War and RRR, whose veiled homoeroticism has inspired cult conspiracy theories and plenty of colourful analysis, Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal appears to be aiming for a 5 on the Kinsey scale. The film’s recently released trailer ends with Lord Bobby Deol’s villain ripping his shirt off and then having a symbolic post-coital smoke literally atop Ranbir Kapoor’s protagonist. Despite not having a single word of dialogue — it is, ahem, being said that he will remain silent throughout the film — Deol’s antagonist was by far the most interesting thing about a piece of promotion that leaves you with little else than a strong urge to take a shower.
Since his comeback some years ago, the one-time matinee idol has mostly played villains, and a quick glance at his upcoming films suggests that this is the path that he has chosen to stick with. These characters are unidimensional, sleepy-eyed and stone-faced crooks who rarely reveal what they’re thinking — this, in all probability, is mainly down to Deol’s limitations as an actor than how they’ve been written. But amid a string of subpar projects in the actor’s recent filmography, there lies a gem. Released only last year, director Shanker Raman’s romantic thriller, Love Hostel, had all the makings of a cult classic, but a hobbled release on ZEE5 made sure that it remains slept-on to this day.

"Meghna Gulzar: ‘With Sam Manekshaw, there’s no scope for villainising anybody’","Sam Bahadur is releasing in theatres this Friday alongside the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal, triggering speculation about a big Bollywood clash.","TELLING THE story of someone as iconic as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw comes with its set of unique requisites. Meghna Gulzar, co-writer-director of his upcoming biopic Sam Bahadur, chose to always place the camera lower than eye-level of actor Vicky Kaushal, who plays the titular lead, so that “it looks up at him”. For Kaushal, however, the “toughest task” was to find Manekshaw’s “heart and spirit”. Gulzar and Kaushal were speaking at the Express Adda in New Delhi on Monday.
Giving a peek into his process of playing Manekshaw, Kaushal said: “The aura that he had was not limited to his uniform. So I have to give it to Meghna, who held my hand through this, because otherwise it was impossible for me to even attempt this.”

Bharathiraja condemns producer KE Gnanavel Raja’s comments against director Ameer,Renowned filmmaker Bharathiraja has hit out against producer KE Gnanavel Raja for his controversial statements against director Ameer.,"KE Gnanavel Raja is facing severe backlash from top directors and producers of Tamil film industry for his recent statements against director Ameer. Director-actor Samuthirakani penned a strongly-worded statement hitting out at the Studio Green producer asking him to be careful with his words. Director Sasikumar of Subramaniapuram fame also came out against Gnanavel Raja. Now, veteran filmmaker Bharathiraja has also condemned the producer’s controversial and demeaning statements against Ameer.
Bharathiraja took to social media to share a statement. In the post, Bharathiraja supported Ameer and said Gnanavel Raja’s statements are condemnable. The statement read, “The issue between you and Ameer is for financial reasons. However, you have spoken about a great creator in a way to cause embarrassment to his art, which is condemnable. Ameer’s contribution in identifying you and making you a successful producer is huge and you shouldn’t forget it. Even before Paruthiveeran, Ameer has directed films and has produced one. To say that he learnt filmmaking with your money with a sly laughter is a disrespect to all creators because a creator will keep learning until death. I am learning even now. In my opinion, you have to apologise and solve the issue for disrespecting a great creator.”

Deepika Padukone says she serves as ‘guinea pig’ for her skincare company’s new products: ‘I’m the first one to try any product’,"Mentioning that 82 E's first aim is to ensure that a product is effective while not compromising on the ingredients, Deepika Padukone asserted that she herself is the 'guinea pig' whenever they make a new product.","Deepika Padukone’s decision to launch the skincare brand 82 E surprised many, given the abundance of such firms in the market. However, since its inception in 2022, 82 E has managed to carve a niche in that space. As the firm celebrates its first anniversary, it is set to expand its research and development (R&D) capacity.
In an interview with Forbes India, Deepika mentioned that consistency has been the most powerful arrow in the company’s arsenal. She said, “We first identified a pain point, which was also my own. Why does skincare have to be so complex? Many brands discuss complex routines and ingredients. I was that person who wanted beautiful glowing skin, but I also wanted it to be simple yet effective. Another issue was always having to choose between brands or products based on Ayurveda versus those based on science. So, we brought all of this together, put it into one bottle, and that’s how 82 EAST came about. In fact, we are now seeing other brands also discussing simplified skincare, and we’re really happy about that.”

Rishab Shetty: ‘OTT platforms are saying that they are not open for Kannada films’,Rishab Shetty shared that OTT platforms are refusing to accept Kannada films because one commercial film from the industry backfired.,"Actor-director Rishab Shetty has said Kannada cinema is waiting for OTT platforms to open their doors for them.
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Tuesday, Shetty said Kannada movies used to generate revenue after participating in initiatives like NFDC Film Bazaar.
“But after the COVID19 pandemic and due to OTT platforms, the markets have collapsed. The OTT platforms are refusing to accept Kannada films because one commercial film (from Kannada) backfired,” the Kantara actor-director said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Now, OTT platforms are saying that they are not open for Kannada films. That is really bad. Just because of one film, you cannot say that there is no market for the film or there are no subscribers,” he added.
Rishab Shetty said he has done three films in Kannada, which are doing festival circuits.
“OTTs are saying that they will take time to accept Kannada films. We are waiting for their doors to open,” he said.
Shetty claimed that if OTT platforms do not open the doors, then these would be the last films that he has done for any festival circuits.

Rishab Shetty received critical acclaim for writing, directing and starring in Kantara, a Kannada period action thriller that was released in 2022.
The movie, which is being screened at IFFI 2023 as part of the international competition, is set in the fictional village of Dakshina Kannada and follows a Kambala champion, played by Shetty, who is at loggerheads with an upright Forest Range officer, Murali.
He is now looking forward to Kantara: Chapter 1, the prequel to the blockbuster hit. The makers unveiled the first look of the movie on Thursday.

Rishab Shetty said filmmakers often talk at length about their movie projects.

“But for Kantara: Chapter 1, I don’t want to talk, people should talk about it. Our concentration should be on the work,” he said.
The actor-director said that his film competing with other international feature films is his “most proud moment” which was possible due to the support that was received for the film.
“We are now producing Kantara: Chapter 1. We released a poster of it and we got a good response for that,” he said.
Shetty said that the idea of producing a prequel to Kantara was there during shooting of the original film but the decision was taken after it became a hit.

In the entire journey of Kantara, the community performing Kola rituals was with him, he added.
“The film is based on our belief system. My family performs the ritual and we believe in it. I have seen people mocking the ritual by performing it on the stage. The community gets hurt because of that. I request people not to hurt the community,” Shetty said.
The actor-director said that he never faced a language barrier for Kantara. “When content is good then the people accept it,” he added.
Post Kantara, Rishab Shetty said he received several offers from non-Kannada filmmakers.

“I was a fan of some of them. But I refused them. I don’t want to leave the Kannada film industry. I am always grateful to the Kannada audience,” Shetty said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/rishab-shetty-ott-platforms-are-saying-that-they-are-not-open-for-kannada-films-9045889/,entertainment

To err is human, to forgive is divine🙏🏻

Mansoor Ali Khan’s controversial comments
At a press meet for the promotion of his upcoming film Sarakku, Mansoor Ali Khan opened up about acting in Vijay’s Leo, which had Trisha in an important role. Though Mansoor and Trisha were part of the film, they didn’t share screen space. Speaking about the same, Mansoor, who has played many antagonist roles, said, “When I heard Trisha was in the film, I thought I would have a bedroom scene with her. I thought I would carry her to the bedroom like I have done with many actresses in my earlier movies. Rape scenes are not new to me. However, these guys didn’t give me a glimpse of Trisha.”
The controversial statement led to severe backlash from actors including Chiranjeevi, Khushbu Sundar, Leo director Lokesh Kanagaraj. Nadigar Sangam, the film body for Tamil actors, issued a temporary ban on the actor and demanded an apology. National Commission for Women took suo moto cognizance of Mansoor’s comments about Trisha.

I stand with Trisha and every woman who has to be subject to such horrid comments.”
Reacting to the same, Mansoor Ali Khan said, “Chiranjeevi garu is a big star. I have acted with him. He throws a party every year for his yesteryear heroines who acted with him. I have also acted with him, but he never invites me (laughs). He only invites them. It is his matter. But he is such a big actor, he could have called me and asked about my statement. He didn’t.”
Mansoor Ali Khan was later questioned by Tamil Nadu police, after which the actor released an apology statement.

Actually, I had never done this before. I waited outside her van when I was an assistant director with my cousin Mohit Suri. He was also an assistant at that time. I waited for atleast for one-and-a-half-hours. I had not done that before. It was ridiculous. We were assisting for Raaz but before that I had seen her film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and I was a huge fan. I wanted to get a glimpse of her.”

"Neena Gupta says women of her generation ‘didn’t have a need for sex’, were taught to satisfy their husbands like ‘it was a job’","Actor Neena Gupta said that she has stopped asking her husband to spend time with her, and doubled down on her past assertion that true love can only exist between a parent and their child.","Actor Neena Gupta said that true love can only exist between a parent and a child, and not between partners. Looking back at her youth, she said that women were taught to satisfy their husbands, and not expect anything in return. As a result, she said, they’d make their children the focus of their attention, and stop caring for themslves. In an interview with Ranveer Allahbadia, Neena said that many women, even today, are trapped in loveless marriages with no option to leave.
She was asked to revisit her comments about love and lust, and she said, “Every romantic relationship begins with lust, this much is true. You are attracted to somebody because of their job, their physique, their mind. And then it is lust, because biologically, it is bound to happen. And then you become friends, and then when you live together and get get married, you care about each other. You can call it love. You can’t divorce your child, can you? Wow, I’ve said such a smart thing. You can’t divorce your child.”

","Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who courted trouble over his previous Hindi film Kabir Singh, is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie Animal, featuring Ranbir Kapoor. The film’s trailer unveils a toxic world intertwined with the strained relationship between Ranbir’s character, Arjun Singh, and his father Balbir Singh, portrayed by Anil Kapoor.
Vanga has now expressed that the definition of toxicity varies from person to person and said that it is influenced by individual perspectives on a story and its characters. He said in an interview with The Hindu, “I did not face much criticism for Arjun Reddy, but it was different for Kabir Singh. I don’t want to name anyone but I saw a few people debating about Kabir Singh to get publicity before the release of their own films. A leading producer-director said he was scared to admit liking Kabir Singh. People acted as though I had made a film on the lines of the French film Irreversible. That film left me disturbed for days, though I could also see the artistic side of it.”

But, Suneel revealed in a new interview, she was gracious enough to help promote the film and didn’t hold any grudges.
Speaking to Zoom Entertainment, Suneel Darshan said that he has a close relationship with the Kapoor family, and that it stems from the respect that he has for Karisma and Kareena Kapoor’s mother, Babita, who raised them single-handedly.

In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Suneel Darshan said that he wasn’t quite impressed by Priyanka when he first laid eyes on her, and recommended that she fix her nose. He implied that her late father, whom he described as ‘an accomplished plastic surgeon’, was responsible for her botched nose surgery. Priyanka has spoken about the ostracization she faced for the surgery, which she has said was to treat sinus. “I wanted to cast a fresh face in the film, and one day, I got a call from the reception saying that someone had come to meet me with a girl. I make sure to meet whoever comes over to my office, and it was Priyanka Chopra. I looked at her and thought, ‘Really?’ I asked them to take a seat,” he said.

Some treat wars like they are cricket matches, not considering the aftermath or the suffering it causes, and view cricket as if it were a war, forgetting that it’s just a game. When news of tensions between countries comes up, there are always a few who suggest war as the solution, while comfortably sharing their opinions from the safety of their homes, far from border areas. In fact, even our movies, in a way, celebrate wars so much that they seldom shed much light on what happens to civilians during and after these intense battles.

How Dibakar Banerjee’s Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! became an introduction to Delhi’s dark underbelly,"Dibakar Banerjee's Oye Lucky Lucky Oye served as a prototype for filmmakers, introducing them to the captivating realm of Delhi's middle-class, specifically West Delhi, as a trove of unexplored stories. Characters like Queen's Vijay Dhingra, Fukrey's Lali, Hunny, and Chhocha, and Titli's Vikram were an extension of Lucky's personality.","In the opening scenes of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Rocky Randhawa (played by Ranveer Singh) introduces his grandmother, Dhan Lakshmi (portrayed by Jaya Bachchan), as an ambitious, money-loving woman who catapulted their sweet business from a modest corner of Delhi to a global brand. While the film predominantly delves into Rocky’s love story, a shift in focus towards Dhan Lakshmi’s life would likely have rendered Rocky Aur Rani a much darker narrative. It would have depicted her unrelenting struggle to climb the social ladder and emancipating her family from the clutches of an unfulfilling middle-class existence in Delhi.
The Randhawa family’s palatial mansion, reminiscent of the US White House, and their fleet of luxurious cars signify their triumphant transition from dingy lanes to the opulent quarters of Delhi NCR, but the same things also underscore their deep-rooted fixation with material possessions.

"Rakshit Shetty, Rukmini Vasanth’s Sapta Sagaradaache Ello duology stands among finest in Kannada cinema despite its flaws","Sapta Sagaradaache Ello stands out as a remarkable project that flawlessly navigates almost every aspect it aims to address, ensuring technical brilliance, yet not without flaws.","“Katte (donkey),” Priya calls Manu every now and then in Hemanth M Rao’s Sapta Sagaradaache Ello – Side A. It’s an affectionate nickname she uses for him. In a society that still clings to the traditional notion of Pati Parmeshwar, with even boyfriends often enforcing similar expectations on their girlfriends, or the latter conforming to the patriarchal norms, Priya’s choice of “Katte” adds a unique warmth that no other alternative word there would have conveyed. The charm is heightened as Manu visibly lights up each time she addresses him with that endearing name.
In the sequel, Sapta Sagaradaache Ello – Side B, however, the term is hardly ever mentioned, except for a few instances of flashbacks, essentially encapsulating the contrast between the two movies, or more specifically, the two entirely different junctures in their lives.

Orry: Who’s that guy and why does it matter?,"The internet is bursting at the seams trying to figure out what Orry does for a living as he lives his best life. As he unleashes his “authentic self” in front of cameras, all we know is that we’re all watching.","“Not my monkey, not my circus” is often the best way to deal with the noise on social media and pretty much everywhere. From whether Aishwarya Rai is getting along with her in-laws to Urfi Javed going from cringe to mainstream in what felt like seconds, it’s a world that doesn’t make sense. It’s like all the neighbourhood aunties and wannabes are collectively running the narrative. Whether in the real world or online, it just gets plain boring.
But there comes Orry or Orhan Awatramani and I’m hooked. Simply because it’s so silly and so much fun. His rise (or fall) to fame is made special by the fact that he isn’t trying too hard. It’s the world chasing him. The internet is bursting at the seams trying to figure out what he does for a living as he lives his best life. Unless that’s the plan of the “marketing genius” as he once called himself. It could well be, as when quizzed on Koffee With Karan, his actor friend Ananya Pandey replied that he’s “loved but misunderstood”, which she was instructed to say by Orry himself.

Rashmika Mandanna on deepfake video: ‘I want to tell all girls out there that this is not normal’,"Rashmika Mandanna, in a recent press meet of her upcoming film Animal, opened up about her deepfake video.","The deepfake video of Rashmika Mandanna shocked the film industry, with several celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, calling for authorities to take immediate action against the menace which has been on the rise for a while now. Rashmika also addressed the issue on social media, and now, during a press meet of her upcoming film Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role, the actor yet again opened up about her deepfake video.
Rashmika shared that such videos shouldn’t be normalised–which has unfortunately become the status quo. The actor said, “So many people came and supported from South industry, North industry. It made me realise that this does not have to be normalised. It made me feel safe, and secure. So I want to tell all girls out there that this is not normal. When something is affecting you, you don’t have to keep quiet. When you take a stand, people will support you. It’s a good country that we live in.”

Sandeep Reddy Vanga reveals his choice of actor for Telugu remake of Animal,"At a press meet of the film Animal in Hyderabad, Sandeep Reddy Vanga was asked whom he will cast in case he remakes Animal in Telugu.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga made a name for himself with the nationwide success of Arjun Reddy, which was later remade in Hindi as Kabir Singh. Now, Sandeep is back with the film Animal which has Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor playing son and father, respectively. The trailer of Animal has raised several eyebrows for its portrayal of a toxic father-son relationship. Ranbir’s character comes across as a menacing force who will not pay heed to anyone other than his father. While Ranbir seems a perfect fit for the role, Sandeep at a press meet in Hyderabad was asked who would he cast in the lead role if Animal is made in Telugu.
Responding to the question from a reporter, Ranbir expressed that he would like to play the lead in Telugu as well by saying, “Sir I am also willing to learn Telugu language.” Meanwhile, Anil Kapoor interrupted and said, “Anil Kapoor.” However, Sandeep already has a name in his mind, and pat came the reply, “Mahesh Babu.”

The Meghna Gulzar directorial announced its release date way before Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film and when Vicky was asked about this, the actor gave his answer using a cricket analogy. “When two opening batsmen come to the crease, playing for the same team, you won’t say that the two batsmen are clashing with each other, they are playing for a single team, so we are playing for Hindi cinema.”

In a conversation with Anant Goenka, Executive Director of The Indian Express group, and film critic Shubhra Gupta at Express Adda, Vicky, along with Meghna Gulzar, spoke about his journey in the film industry and revealed why he thinks Anurag Kashyap’s Raman Raghav 2.0 was his worst performance ever.
Speaking about Raman Raghav 2.0, Vicky said, “Raman Raghav 2.0 was directed by Anurag Kashyap. It was a very dark film. I was playing a cop which my mother was really happy about. But I didn’t give her the details of what kind of a cop he is. The film was a very dark and twisted tale about a cop and a serial killer. To be very honest, I still feel that that is my worst performance till date because at that time I felt like I haven’t lived through life experiences to get into the skin of the character. That is one role, I feel, every five years of my life, I will play it differently and I will play it better. I come from a protective upbringing and that is not what my character’s life was and at the age of 25, when I was playing that part, there was little bit of the gap that I had to fill to understand.”

However, with Sam Bahadur, whose much-anticipated release in theatres is scheduled for December 1, their creative partnership is now considered one of the most exciting collaborations in contemporary Hindi cinema.","AFTER collaborating for Raazi (2018), which enjoyed both critical and commercial success, writer-director Meghna Gulzar and actor Vicky Kaushal reunited to work on Sam Bahadur, the upcoming biopic of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.

Resul Pookutty on venturing into film direction: ‘I was learning every day from everyone’,"Resul Pookutty, a sound designer, mixer and editor, has worked on more than 100 movies across languages including Slumdog Millionaire, for which he won the Oscar.","“We are filmmakers first and then practitioners of any particular craft,” says Oscar-winning sound mixer Resul Pookutty, who recently made his directorial debut with Malayalam film Otta.
Pookutty, a sound designer, mixer and editor, has worked on more than 100 movies across languages including Slumdog Millionaire, for which he won the Oscar, Ghajini, Enthiran, Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, Pushpa and Radhe Shyam.
His maiden film as a director, Otta, was based on author S. Hariharan’s book Runaway Children, and working on the project was a huge learning experience for him.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It made me aware that you have to conduct your life every day as an inspiring person. You can have all the money in the world, but not be able to make a film. You can pay people, they’ll come and do work for you. But they won’t create something new.
“If you want them to create something new along with you, you have to be a very inspiring character. And for me, in the 80 days that I shot, I was learning every day from everyone, despite the fact that I worked in more than 100 movies. For me, I was taking baby steps. It was an enriching experience, very beautiful,” Pookutty told PTI in an interview.
Also read | Otta movie review: Resul Pookutty’s Asif Ali, Indrajith-starrer is an overstretched semi-biographical infomercial
Otta, which was released in theatres in October this year, featured actors Asif Ali, Arjun Ashokan, Indrajith Sukumaran, Sathyaraj, Adil Hussain, Indrans and Divya Dutta.
Becoming a director does not mean that Resul Pookutty will stop working as a sound mixer, he said.

The artiste believes anyone working in cinema is a filmmaker first and then a “practitioner of a particular craft”.
“There are editors and cinematographers that become directors. They have not left their core job. I have not left my sound. I will not leave my sound. We’ve always been filmmakers. We are filmmakers first and then practitioners of a particular craft. Unless, there’s a good filmmaker inside you, you’re not a good sound man. You’re not a cameraman or an editor unless there is a serious filmmaker within you. So you just found that out and then you just shift it,” he said.
Decoding his job as a sound mixer and designer, Pookutty said he makes the “first selective listening” for the audience who will watch the movie.
“Sound in films is a subconscious art, you see things. When you see things, you understand what you’re seeing but when you hear, you’re hearing, not listening. So there is a difference between hearing and listening.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As a sound man, I am making selective listening for my audience. I want him or her to hear a particular thing and walk them through the narrative graph of the film. That’s what I do,” he said.
Every film has its challenges, but language has never been a barrier in his work, Pookutty added.
“To me, language doesn’t matter. It is just a sound. Other than that, I don’t look at language as a text. For me, it is an everyday expression. So I’m able to work in a Russian film, I’m able to work in Scandinavian movies, I’m able to work in a Punjabi film.
“At the same time, I will create music for a Tamil movie or Malayalam movie and Hindi, so I just keep jumping around. So, as long as you understand that aspect of life, you can create new rhythms for every sequence.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Resul Pookutty is currently attending the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where he was part of a panel discussion, Road to Oscars.
He believes that compared to all other works of art, filmmaking and films are very refreshing and life changing.
“Every film is a huge journey of someone’s life. You see human relationships, places, people, culture and language. Every film is walking through a lifetime. So, if you watch 50 films, it’s like 50 lifetimes that you’ve gone through and so of course it is going to enrich you. It will change you as a human being. It has made me a better version of me over time every time I do a film,” he said.
Pookutty said a platform like IFFI enables storytellers to understand how their contemporaries across the globe are doing and what they’re doing.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You understand cinema as a language and as a celluloid art, that’s what IFFI has given us. When we grow up, become what we have become, I will come back to IFFI and impart whatever knowledge I have acquired along the way,” he added.
The 54th edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) will conclude on November 28.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/resul-pookutty-on-venturing-into-film-direction-i-was-learning-every-day-from-everyone-9043374/,entertainment

Earlier, there were reports that Turbo is a sequel to Mammootty’s 1990 action comedy film Kottayam Kunjachan. However, in an interview with Asianet News, Mammootty denied these claims. He said, “Adi Pidi Jose is not the title of the film, and neither it has any connection with the character I played in Kottayam Kunjachan.”
Turbo is written by Midhun Manuel Thomas. Talking about Turbo, Midhun Manuel Thomas told Club FM 94.3 that the film is going to be an action comedy. He added, “The director was introduced to me by editor Shameer Muhammed, who asked me if I could write a script for Vysakh. Later, Vysakh and I had a conversation, getting to know each other. I suggested a few scripts I had in hand. While discussing a suitable project, I proposed an action film script to him. He liked it and we proceeded to present the script to Mammooka. He, too, was ready to sign the project, and things began from there.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/mammootty-unveils-first-look-poster-of-turbo-see-here-9043362/,entertainment
"Salman Khan up for Katrina Kaif headlining Zoya spin off film, but says there’s a catch: ‘Tiger will save the day in climax’","Salman Khan joked that he can come in a Zoya spin off film, but Katrina Kaif wouldn't be so keen to do a limited screen-time role if tables were turned.","A Zoya spin off film cannot be complete without her Tiger. Superstar Salman Khan says he is totally game for Katrina Kaif headlining a solo action film of her spy character Zoya, but with a slight addition– he will also join the movie.
In Yash Raj Films’ Tiger series, Salman features in the titular role as RAW agent, while Katrina plays Zoya, a Pakistani spy. The two characters, first appeared in Kabir Khan’s 2011 film Ek Tha Tiger, are married and continue to fight for the country. Salman and Katrina are currently seen playing their fan favourite characters in Tiger 3.
During a press conference to talk about his latest Diwali release, Salman Khan was asked his thoughts about a spin off film featuring Zoya. The superstar said the film can be about Zoya but will definitely also feature his character Tiger.

“Ya why not. But I think Zoya would be very incomplete without Tiger. So, Tiger will have to be there and save the day in the climax. Even if he is not there throughout the film, but there has to be a Tiger introduction, a telephone call (to him), a hook in the interval. Then in the climax, when Zoya needs Tiger, he lands up there to make sure that together they accomplish the mission,” he said.
Salman said the two characters have now become inseparable. The superstar joked that he can come in a Zoya spin off film, but Katrina wouldn’t be so keen to do a limited screen-time role if tables were turned.

“Tiger and Zoya have become so synonymous that me without Zoya or Zoya without me will feel empty. But if we tell the same thing to Zoya, that there will be her introduction, then she will come in the interval then a bit in the climax, woh jhel nahi payegi (she won’t be able to take it). Woh apna role badate jayegi (She will keep increasing her role),” he added.
Directed by Maneesh Sharma, Tiger 3 also stars Emraan Hashmi. The movie has been an underperformer at the box office, minting Rs 264 crore at the domestic box office. It failed to live up to the gigantic pre-release expectations and will likely take a big hit at the box office this Friday when Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal releases.

Abhijeet Sawant refutes Amit Sana’s claim that Indian Idol voting lines were rigged against him: ‘Would’ve caused riots’,"Indian Idol 1 winner Abhijeet Sawant has refuted claims made by the show's runner-up, Amit Sana, stating that the channel blocked his lines before the finale to secure Abhijeet's victory.","Singer Amit Sana, the runner-up of Indian Idol season 1, recently accused the show of rigging voting lines in the favour of winner Abhijeet Sawant. In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Amit claimed that the channel blocked his lines before the finale and helped Abhijeet win the show. Now, Abhijeet has responded to Amit’s claims.
Also speaking to Siddharth Kannan, he said in Hindi, “I have to come to the show only to give a clarification about these claims. So, yeh jhooth hai (This is a lie). If I speak truly, we were all kids at the time. If lines were blocked, then me and Rahul should have been in the top two. Because Rahul has always been a favourite of everyone. Rahul also made a good career after Indian Idol. He is doing good work even today. He did a show like Bigg Boss. He has always been popular. So if lines were blocked, then Amit wouldn’t have even made it to the finals. And who was I? Why would they block the lines for me? I struggled a lot, I did well on each song that I performed to reach the final. I was called an under-dog, a dark horse. It was not in our hands.”
He added, “In life, when we regret and blame things on other people, we do it to reduce pressure on ourselves. After you blame someone, you become free. But you shouldn’t do that. You have to just work, we are all here to work and not to blame each other. During the show, if he was naive, so was I, I didn’t work for the Ambani family. It is not possible to block lines because it is such a big show, it can cause riots. The votes came in crores.”

Speaking about success of the contestants post Indian Idol, Abhijeet said, “After the show, albums came out. First my album came, then Amit’s came and for Rahul music directors, Sajid-Wajid, did the whole album. But my album sold 13 lakh copies and their albums couldn’t even cross a lakh. So you say your lines were blocked, but people can buy your album right? There should be a right theory to explain this claim, but that theory doesn’t exist.”

"Salman Khan says people call him a superstar because of his ‘arrogant walk’, believes he’s an ‘average Bandra boy’","On the sidelines of Tiger 3's release, Salman Khan spoke about being misunderstood as arrogant, addressed his career lows, and why he and YRF never collaborated on films before Ek Tha Tiger in 2012.","Salman Khan is basking in the success of his latest YRF venture, the third installment of Tiger franchise, Tiger 3, with Katrina Kaif. The actor, who is seen as one of the biggest superstars in the country, said that he rejects such terms, and urged others to stop using them for him.
In a group interview, Salman told indianexpress.com that while he doesn’t consider himself a superstar, it is his walk that often gives a wrong impression. He said, “Whoever is a superstar in his mind is a superstar. I don’t think of that at all, so I am not. People like to be called superstars and megastars, that’s something that I don’t like.”

“My arrogant walk makes people feel I am a superstar”
“Stardom doesn’t show in the way I am, but I am sure it shows in my walk. My walk is considered to be an arrogant walk but that’s the way I walk and I cannot change that walk, and I am comfortable in that walk and I am comfortable in my skin. Sometimes it comes out in a way that ‘yeh dekho, inki chaal dekho, kya samajhte hai? (Look at him, his walk, what does he think of himself)?’ But I’ve been walking like that from childhood. Now if I walk like someone else then it won’t suit me. So, now this is who I am, what I do. But yes, I don’t believe in this superstardom, and I have not done anything that I can take the credit of superstardom. Everyone, from our DOP (director of photography) to the scriptwriter to the director help this normal average Bandra boy look heroic on screen. That credit, I don’t like taking alone at all.”

Career lows don’t matter

He said, “The lows that you are talking about, the lows that I have been through, maybe the highest point of 99.9% of the country. So that low also, if I say that it was a low point for me then fans will say ‘yeh low hai toh hamara kya hai?’(If these are your lows then what about ours?)

“Competing with myself”
Despite that, he said, he takes full responsibility for his flops. He said, “You need to keep working harder and every year that goes by you need to work twice as hard, because you are growing older as well. You need to keep competing with yourself, you are anyway competing with your juniors and seniors but it is very important to compete with yourself.”
Not doing YRF film for 21 years
Salman then spoke about how and why Ek Tha Tiger was his first venture with YRF after 21 years. When asked if it was worth the wait, he said, “So, you need to ask Adi (YRF head honcho Aditya Chopra) this question. It is not that I did not do a YRF film for the longest time, Adi did not do a Salman Khan film for the longest time. That is the question that I don’t answer, he answers that.

"Salman Khan on perception that he doesn’t work hard on set: ‘They think I drink coffee, look here and there, leave’","Salman Khan reflected on his journey before entering the film industry, highlighting the extensive groundwork he puts into his projects even before they commence filming.","Salman Khan, known for his action-packed films, is currently witnessing box office success with his latest project, Tiger 3. In a recent conversation, the actor reflected on his journey before entering the film industry, highlighting the extensive groundwork he puts into his projects even before they commence filming.
Speaking at a recent press conference, Salman opened up about his struggling days before he entered the film industry and said, “People say that we will put in all the work after we get the film. All these things, I have done much before I came into the industry. The four-five years of struggle that I did before I came into the industry, before I did films like Maine Pyar Kiya and Biwi Ho To Aisi. After that also, whenever I sign a movie, I have to like it in the first narration. If I like a film, I shift that film before my other projects. And the projects that I have postponed, they will likely not happen. Until that time, I won’t sign another film. That is what I usually concentrate on.”
Talking about how he has to maintain a disciplined lifestyle and put in a lot of hard work before reaching the set, Salman said, “I don’t see you guys catching me anywhere, no parties and nothing. I shoot and I go back home. All the discussions that I have are either on Being Human, which is mostly about family stuff, friends and movies. The hard work is done at home with the director. That’s why on the set it is perceived as, ‘This man comes, looks here and there, drinks coffee, gives the shot and leaves.’ But all the work has been done before I land up on the set. I don’t believe in going out and gossiping, bitching about people and following the box office numbers of other films. I don’t believe in that.”

Tiger 3, co-starring Katrina Kaif, has achieved success with a global collection of Rs 420 crore.

Rejecting the feminist theory that asserts men and women are equal, she said that this isn’t true because men can’t give birth. The actor stressed the importance of financial independence regardless of gender. Additionally, she stated that ‘women need men’ and provided a personal example to support her statement.
In a conversation with Ranveer Allahbadia, Neena said in Hindi, “I want to say that it’s not necessary to believe in ‘faltu feminism’ or the idea that ‘women are equal to men.’ Instead, focus on achieving financial independence and giving attention to your work. If you’re a housewife, don’t look down on it; it’s an important role. Boost your self-esteem and avoid thinking of yourself as small. That’s the main message I want to convey. Additionally, men and women are not equal. The day men start getting pregnant, that day we will be equal.”
The actor gave an example to support her statement that ‘women need men’, and said, “I had to catch a flight once at 6 a.m. I did not have a boyfriend at that time. I came out of the house at 4 a.m. and it was dark. A man started following me, I went back to my house and I missed my flight. The next day I booked the same flight. But I stayed at my male friend’s house and he dropped me off. I need a man.”

The actor opened up about her goal of becoming someone who is not dependent on anyone in life. Neena shared that she is still working towards achieving this independence because she finds herself calling her daughter Masaba and worrying if she doesn’t answer. She also admitted to feeling anxious if her husband doesn’t call her.

"Koffee with Karan Season 8: Reheated coffee, a new couch and lots of yawn-versations","From the inappropriate questions on the sex lives of his proteges to lengthy monologues that he struggled to deliver, the conscience with a k had done his consumer research and an in-depth study of the comments section on social media.","Koffee with Karan Season 8 was announced with a very well-made promo where Karan’s konscience, with a k of course, trolled him about the shortcomings of Season 7. From the inappropriate questions on the sex lives of his proteges to lengthy monologues that he struggled to deliver, the conscience with a k had done his consumer research and an in-depth study of the comments section on social media. But Season 8, now streaming on Disney +Hotstar, doesn’t manage to brew a fresh pot of kon-versations with every episode, mostly serving reheated coffee on a new couch.
Season 8 started with Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh whom Karan introduced as Bollywood royalty. The two looked lovely and demonstrated just how much equality is there in their relationship by equally dividing the talking points during the episode. Ranveer spoke in the first half while Deepika nodded coyly and she took over in the second half of the episode to talk about issues close to her heart. The highlight of the episode for me though was not the wedding video which seemed too much of an orchestrated PR exercise, but Karan and Deepika’s candid admissions about having anxiety attacks and not always being as put together as they seem. It was refreshingly honest, brave and a glimpse into how hard it is for sensitive, creative minds to be in such an unrelentingly competitive business.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/koffee-with-karan-season-8-reheated-coffee-a-new-couch-and-lots-of-yawn-versations-9041647/,entertainment

Sunil Dutt walked off set in anger as Yash Johar could arrange only 99 camels instead of 100: ‘He said pack-up and…’,"During the shoot of his 1971 film Reshma Aur Shera, Sunil Dutt asked production controller Yash Johar to arrange for 100 camels. When Johar could bring only 99 camels, Dutt walked off the film's set.","Late filmmaker-actor-politician Sunil Dutt was a strict taskmaster and it is evident from a recent anecdote that Karan Johar narrated from the sets of the 1971 film Reshma Aur Shera. Dutt was the star of the film, and also the director. It also starred Waheeda Rehman, Amitabh Bachchan, Raakhee, Ranjeet, and Amrish Puri, among others. Karan’s late father and producer, Yash Johar was the production controller on the film.
During the shoot of Reshma Aur Shera, Dutt asked Johar that he needed 100 camels for a scene. Karan recalled during an interaction with Film Companion, “Dutt sahab told my father overnight that for Reshma Aur Shera, he wanted 100 camels. My father was a production controller so he was given these requirements. Overnight, he went to the nearby villages and got the camels. They weren’t 100.”
An ‘exhausted’ and ‘sleep-deprived’ Yash Johar went to Dutt and told him he couldn’t arrange 100 camels, but they were 99. “He told him, ‘Dutt sahab, I am sorry. I couldn’t get you 100 camels. But I could get you 99.’ Dutt sahab looked at him and said ‘Pack up’ and walked off. He was serious because they weren’t 100 but 99 camels,” shared Karan.

Richa Chadha recalls reprimanding casting director for offering role of Hrithik Roshan’s mother: ‘You’re taking away an older actor’s part’,"Richa Chadha shared that she was once offered the role of Hrithik Roshan's mother. After she refused to do it, the casting director never called her again.","Actor Richa Chadha’s role of young and feisty Bholi Punjaban in the Fukrey franchise is much appreciated by the audience. Her performance in films like Gangs of Wasseypur, Masaan and Love Sonia, among others has also received critical acclaim. But there was a time when she was offered the role of actor Hrithik Roshan’s mother, despite him being older than her.
In an interview with ABPLive, Richa recalled the incident and also highlighted how it’s not fair to older artists who already have limited work.
When asked if she got angry at the casting director, Richa replied, “Yes, because I was 21 years old. But someone had told him that I play the role of older women nicely. So without thinking, he just offered me the role. Later, the actor who actually played that part is a very good artist. So I felt that this is wrong that you are taking young and attractive actors and ageing them.”

Richa felt it was not only unfair to her but also to the older artists who fit the role better than her. “Not only are you doing a disservice to a young actor, you are also taking away an older actor’s part which is already shrinking.”
She added, “To usool ke hisaab se bhi maine mana kia tha. Baaki uss casting director ne mujhe kabhi bulaya nahi wo alag baat hai. (So, I refused to do it on moral ground. But that casting director never called me again, also).”
In Gangs of Wasseypur, Richa played an older girl. Justifying why she took up the role, the actor said that in the Anurag Kashyap film, she was not the only one whose character was aged.
“In Gangs of Wasseypur, I never felt that I would be singled out. Everyone’s story was 30-40 years ahead. They didn’t put any spotlight on me. Call it our industry’s sexism or society’s sexism, they highlighted it. The truth is that Manoj Bajpayee, Huma Qureshi, Piyush Mishra, all of them had undergone ageing in that film,” said Richa.

Vijay Varma says ‘extremely violent’ Darlings character left him exhausted: ‘Roz yahi karte karte…’,"Vijay Varma recently openly discussed his career, highlighting the challenges of portraying a ruthless villain in Darlings and how it left him exhausted after a certain point.","The OTT boom has significantly contributed to Indian cinema, especially by introducing numerous talented actors and technicians with no prior industry connections. Among them, who have now become highly cherished, Vijay Varma stands out for his exceptional performances and thoughtful choices.
In 2023 alone, Vijay featured in two films — Lust Stories 2 and Jaane Jaan — as well as two web series — Dahaad and Kaalkoot — garnering praise from all quarters for his outstanding performances.
During a recent session at Sahitya Aaj Tak OTT 2023, Vijay openly discussed his career, highlighting the challenges of portraying a ruthless villain in Jasmeet K Reen’s Darlings and how it left him exhausted after a certain point.

Discussing his portrayal of antagonist roles in Darlings and Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar’s Dahaad, both of which garnered the actor significant acclaim, Vijay shared that embodying these characters presented substantial and unique challenges. He explained, “The character in Darlings was actively violent. It was challenging as I constantly sought to understand why he behaved that way, raising his hands on people and speaking in a certain manner. In real life, I am nothing like that. Playing the violent character every day eventually took a toll on me. I got tired after a while. Then there was a point during shooting a specific sequence when my hands were tied to a chair for 10-15 days. Initially, I was the one inflicting harm, but later, others turned the tables, and I found myself on the receiving end.”
“In Dahaad, on the other hand, the character I portrayed didn’t involve much on-screen violence; whatever actions he took were executed silently,” he noted.
When enquired about his approach to portraying such intense villainous characters, Vijay expressed his readiness to embrace any role that satisfies his hunger. He also drew parallels between his life story and that of the turtle from the tale of “The Tortoise and the Hare”.

Regarding his skill in acing close-up shots through eye and facial expressions, Vijay observed that the eyes convey the most when we see or interact with a person. “So, I believe that whatever is going through your mind, even if you attempt to conceal it, your eyes won’t be able to lie.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Discussing the differences in working across theatre, film and OTT platforms, Vijay expressed, “I was born in the theatre realm, worked in films, and currently working a lot in streaming platforms. I haven’t perceived significant differences among them. An actor’s responsibility is to understand the script and their character, learn the dialogues and work hand-in-hand with those involved in the production. While their pitching and metres may vary, each medium mutually benefits actors.”

Vijay also highlighted his longing for involvement in big projects suitable for the theatres, expressing anticipation for those he is already part of.

Irrfan Khan is a person I hold deep affection for. In my perception, he continues to live on. Who isn’t a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, including me? Tabu is also among my preferred performers.”
He also noted a shift in his approach to roles, revealing that he stopped taking on roles solely for money after being fired from a film where he portrayed a small reporter’s role at a time when he had a mere Rs 18 in his bank account.

The actor said, “While I live my life, I also observe it and I am exploring it. In recent times, an image has formed about me that I am a very humble person. Everyone else says so. Now I am literally evaluating if I am genuinely so ‘humble’ or if I am a sharp witted man who acts to be a humble man. I am still discovering it. So am I really humble? Because even I get angry. I even get the feeling of taking revenge, but then I overcome it with time.”

"Emraan Hashmi says he ‘doesn’t suck up’ to Salman Khan and call him ‘bhai’: ‘I respect everyone, don’t segregate people on film set’","While discussing his equation with Salman Khan, actor Emraan Hashmi shared why he doesn't call him 'bhai' even when he takes him as a brother.","Actor Emraan Hashmi has been receiving a lot of praise for his portrayal of antagonist Aatish Rehman, an ex-ISI agent in Tiger 3, starring  Salman Khan. The actor recently opened up on his equation with Salman and reveled why, unlike most actors, he doesn’t call Salman ‘bhai’.
In an interview with Connect FM Canada, Emraan shared the reason why he doesn’t believe in showing respect through words, but by actions. He said, “I might not call Salman ‘bhai’ but I take him as a brother, I take him as a friend. So I don’t need to address him that way and go around and tom-tom about it and put a label on him just because other people call him that.”

"Sanjay Dutt’s lawyer reveals how the actor wore a tattered garment in jail: ‘Earlier, he would wear an outfit only once’",Sanjay Dutt's lawyer Pradeep Rai reveals that the actor changed many things about himself after he spent a few years in prison.,"Actor Sanjay Dutt stayed behind bars for almost nine years as sentenced by the TADA court for illegal possession of firearms during the 1993 Mumbai blasts.

The actor’s lawyer Pradeep Rai revealed the actor’s non-glamorous journey and how it affected him. The lawyer also said that Sanjay used to discard clothes after he had worn them once but all of that changed when he went to prison.
In an interview with Lallantop, Pradeep said that Sanjay took his imprisonment in a positive way. He spoke in Hindi and said, “Sanjay Dutt had changed. When he used to meet me, he would say, ‘Sir you haven’t seen me before’. He would also say that now things had changed and his daughter was also grown up. There are many ups and downs in a man’s life but there are one or two important things which he missed out on because of drugs and this case. But even then he didn’t lose patience. The day he was going to jail, I couldn’t go to Mumbai and he called me and told me that he is going in.”

Retribution movie review: Liam Neeson’s lazily written thriller lives up to the blandness of its title,"Retribution movie review: Liam Neeson collects yet another paycheck in director Nimród Antal's sloppily written, unintentionally funny, and shamelessly derivative action movie.","People complain about Akshay Kumar filming full movies without setting foot outside the studio, but they should know that Liam Neeson spends nearly the entire run time of his latest actioner, Retribution, literally on his butt. Nobody can fault him for agreeing to what must have been a handsome payday for acting with just the upper-half of his body. But after promising that he was done with this sort of thing, you’d imagine that only an excellent idea would convince him to return. Unfortunately, to call Retribution forgettable would be paying it a compliment; it’s the kind of movie that feels designed to guilt you into doing something worthwhile with your life.
While the title could theoretically be applied to any kind of movie under the sun — I could tell you that Retribution is a stoner comedy and you wouldn’t know — it’s also indicative of the amount of thought that the entire project has been put together with. Which is to say, not a lot. It’s as if a producer watched the original Spanish movie upon which it is based, hired somebody to slap together an adaptation, and got Lionsgate to green-light it based on the first draft itself.

"Maharani movie review: Roshan Mathew, Shine Tom Chacko film is a laugh riot if and only if you are willing to switch off your brain","Maharani movie review: G Marthandan's film, starring Roshan Mathew and Shine Tom Chacko, will deliver plenty of laughs if you are ready to completely switch off your brain and let the movie guide you on its journey.","Remember the frequent scenes of fervent chaos and bustling energy in films by Lijo Jose Pellissery and Tinu Pappachan? These are the moments portraying people shedding even the slightest trace of goodness in them, adopting a raw and animalistic demeanour. What if a comedy film embraces this approach, releasing a lively crowd on-screen, and engaging in conflicts while ensuring that humour is prevalent? G Marthandan’s Maharani is, in a nutshell, exactly this, although it lacks some of the elements that characterised the movies of the aforementioned filmmakers.
Set in Alappuzha district, Ajeesh aka Aji (Shine Tom Chacko) and Vijeesh aka Viji (Roshan Mathew) are brothers whose bond is akin to best friends, with no secrets between them. They also share a warm relationship with their father (Johny Antony). Viji, a local casanova, has a history of multiple girlfriends but is contemplating jilting all of them to focus on one, only because she comes from a wealthy family. Meanwhile, Ajeesh plans to marry his girlfriend Kavya (Sruthy Jayan), who belongs to an upper caste and hence she is eloping from her home.

Divya Dutta: ‘Nice to not follow cliche norm of belonging to a box’,"Divya Dutta said when she tried to experiment with her roles, people would find different labels to describe her.","Actors don’t need to be categorised in boxes, says Divya Dutta, a versatile performer who is happy that female artists are finally getting the space to experiment without being pigeonholed. In a career spanning over 25 years, Dutta has delivered critically praised performances in films such as Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh, Veer-Zaara, Delhi-6, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Badlapur to name a few.
The actor believes that earlier the industry standards were different for male actors when they would venture out of their comfort zone and try something new with their characters.
“I have seen that male actors are still given that leeway of being called actors whatever they might do. If you have Nawaz, you had Irrfan (Khan), Manoj (Bajpayee) and now it is Vijay Sethupathi, they can just cross over, do any role and then come back to what they were doing and do it so brilliantly. But with women, it was a little less when you had a woman doing a different role, especially the pre-OTT era,” Dutta told PTI in an interview.

The 46-year-old actor said when she tried to experiment with her roles, people would find different labels to describe her.

“For female actors, I think that gradually happened. Now I’m called an actor. But I do feel it’s nice to not follow that cliché norm of belonging to a box. We don’t belong in any boxes. We make our own skies, we shine and just star in them,” Dutta said.

  A post shared by Divya Dutta (@divyadutta25)
The actor recalled that someone used the term “unconventional” to describe her as an artiste and she now owns it.
“When OTT wasn’t there and when I was doing only feature films, people didn’t know where to place me because I wasn’t really romancing the hero but I had the best role in the film. So they didn’t know what to call me. So they started calling me the unconventional heroine. And I just loved it because it’s nice to carve your own path rather than just follow something that’s there.” Dutta said she is glad to have a career where she “can cross the images and the roles that are given”.
“I love to play a villain, I love to do comedy, I love to romance my hero. I’m doing all three of those and yet I don’t have an image. So I’m happy about that,” she said.

The Ludhiana-born actor currently serves as a jury member for the best web series (OTT) award at the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here.
The award category, incorporated at the festival with the current edition, will be presented to a show for its “artistic merit, storytelling excellence, technical prowess and overall impact”.
The jury is headed by filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani and also includes Bengali superstar Prosenjit Chatterjee, filmmakers Krishna DK and Utpal Borpujari.
“It’s first a matter of great honour. It’s the first time this kind of award has been inculcated… It is also a huge responsibility because what I’m advised to watch as an audience is different, but when you watch as a jury, then you have such a wide diversity of shows and they’re all so good.

“So it becomes difficult, but I think it’s a process which when you sit with like-minded people will come to a conclusion.” Dutta has been part of two OTT shows — “Special OPS” and Hostages — which premiered on streaming service Disney+ Hotstar.
She said she has worked on two-three more projects that will be released in the coming year.
“For an actor, it doesn’t really make much of a difference, except that there is an increase in the number of dates. But then it’s a role and you play it in a different medium, it’s just that. I think things have changed for the production, for directors and writers more so than for actors,” Dutta said.

Manoj Bajpayee on lack of independent content on OTT platforms: ‘It’s a sad development’,"Manoj Bajpayee said it is unimaginable for independent films to get funding at par with tentpoles such as Jawan, Pathaan or Tiger 3.","New voices should be applauded and given a platform, said Manoj Bajpayee on Friday as he lamented the lack of mentorship provided by the streaming services to independent filmmakers.
During a panel discussion at the 54th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here, the actor said when the streaming services started in India, they backed independent storytellers but now these platforms are giving priority to blockbuster films.
“One thing that all streaming services started with initially was that they were making independent cinema but that got lost somewhere. For some reason, it has gone down completely and now we see blockbuster films making their way big time.

“But the independent cinema movement that started and was getting such mentorship from the OTT platforms, is gone. And that is a very sad development,” Bajpayee said.
If there is no independent cinema, then the Indian film industry will not evolve, he stressed.
“We will only grow in terms of money but we will not grow as creative people. New voices should be applauded and given platforms. I think they were doing so beautifully well earlier,” he added.

Manoj Bajpayee said it is unimaginable for independent films to get funding at par with tentpoles such as Jawan, Pathaan or Tiger 3.
“It can’t stand a chance and if you’re giving shows at 9 am for an independent film, it will never do well. It will fall flat. I really request from this stage to all these platforms that they should revive that mentorship,” the actor said.

Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, the co-creators of Bajpayee’s popular OTT series The Family Man, agreed with Bajpayee.
“Earlier, all these films were directly made or shown on OTT. Now it is a clause that it has to play in theatres and only then we will take it,” Nidimoru said.
Krishna added, “This is happening worldwide right now. There used to be a time when there would be a film and then there would be an OTT movie. But The Russo Brothers made The Gray Man for Netflix and it is as big as any theatrical film. So now every film is a big film.”

Apoorva Bakshi, who backed International Emmy-winning series Delhi Crime and Hunt for Veerappan, said streamers are pouring in resources into making blockbusters.

“There is no safe home left for independent films and that is happening because a lot of resources are going into the blockbusters. I believe independents help filmmakers to become better show creators and directors,” she said.
Raj Nidimoru said being an independent filmmaker taught him and Krishna DK to be self-sufficient.
“We didn’t know anyone in the industry, we taught ourselves. So this whole package of indie cinema gave us the confidence that wherever you give us, we can make a film, irrespective of the budget and the stars. I think that’s what still keeps us going,” he said.
Krishna believes independent filmmaking helps in coming to terms with the fact that “you won’t get everything you want”.

“You kind of adapt then, I think jugaad is the word. You somehow get the job done and that’s how we started making films… Then this OTT and series concept came to India. We were fans of the shows from the West but nobody knew how to make a series in India. I think that jugaad mentality and idea of going back and figuring out how it is done, that came in handy,” he added.
The 54th edition of IFFI will conclude on November 28.

Tiger 3 box office collection Day 13 early reports: Salman Khan-Katrina Kaif struggles to cross the Rs 2 crore mark,"Tiger 3 box office collection: With such an underwhelming performance at the ticket counters, it looks like a tough task for the Salman Khan film to earn as much as the previous film in the franchise, Tiger Zinda Hai.","Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif’s spy-thriller Tiger 3 has slowed down significantly at the box office. While it was expected to have a collection at par with Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan and Jawan, it has not even earned half of what both the films earned during their lifetime. On its second Friday, the film’s collection fell to around Rs 2.27 crore from Thursday’s Rs 5.12 crore.
As per early estimates (posted at 7 pm) by industry tracker Sacnilk, Tiger 3 had Hindi occupancy of 7.85% and 10.14% in the morning and afternoon shows, respectively. The film’s total domestic collection after 13 days stands at Rs 257.14 crore. With such an underwhelming performance at the ticket counters, it looks like a tough task for the Maneesh Sharma directorial to even earn as much as the previous film in the franchise, Tiger Zinda Hai.

Napoleon review: Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby’s inspired performances lift impressively mounted film,Napoleon movie review: Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby add layers to Ridley Scott's film with their inspired performances.,"“Terror is nothing but justice… severe, prompt, inflexible justice.” So begins Napoleon, promising us a political film resonant with one of the most pressing debates of our times, even if the setting is the turmoil following the 1789 French Revolution.
However, Ridley Scott, a director of big men and big spectacles, is not interested in anything as complex. His Napoleon, written by David Scarpa, is an impressively mounted biography of the general who would redefine the battlefield, but you will come away not much wiser about the man himself.

Wish: This Disney movie tries to find magic in familiarity,"Though the storyline is predictable, the film has several enjoyable moments, songs and catchy lines","Though this new animation film from Disney doesn’t roll out something absolutely fresh, it pieces together enough feel-good elements from the studio’s much-loved cinematic universe to showcase the adventures of yet another gritty young woman, Asha (which means ‘hope’ in Hindi). The musical packs oodles of cuteness, several songs, magic and conflicts for a fun ride that would make for a perfect family viewing with young ones.
Riding on nostalgia associated with classic tales, the film boasts of a talented team with Oscar-winning actor Ariana DeBose being cast as Asha; Chris Pine as Magnifico; Angelique Cabral as graceful Queen Amaya and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino. The film is helmed by director Chris Buck (‘Frozen’ and ‘Frozen 2’) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (story writer of ‘Raya and the Last Dragon’) — both of them have successful titles to their credit. Thematically, the film, which celebrates 100 years of Disney, seems to be inspired by the song ‘When You Wish Upon a Star’ that features in the 1940-film Pinocchio.

"Paranoid Sanjay Dutt was afraid he’d be killed in an encounter while being transferred from jail, recalls ex-IPS officer: ‘He started sweating, complained of fever’","Sanjay Dutt was a well-behaved inmate, recalled former IPS officer Meeran Chadha Borwankar in an interview.","Former IPS officer Meeran Chadha Borwankar, who wrote about her stint as the additional director general of police (prisons) when actor Sanjay Dutt was convicted of illegal possession of firearms during the 1993 Mumbai blasts, spoke about her interactions with him in a new interview. She denied that he received any preferential treatment in jail, and said that it was always in his interest to be well-behaved because otherwise, his furlough and parole would’ve been denied. In her book, she also recalled how paranoid the actor became when he was about to be transferred to another jail.
Asked if he was ‘too nice’ a prisoner, she said in an interview with Cyrus Broacha on his podcast, “He used his sources to find out that I’m from Punjab. He embarrassed me a little. But the main issue was the media alleging that we give him special treatment, which we did not. And he was nice generally because his parole and furlough was dependant on his behaviour in the prison. Had he not behaved, we would not have permitted him furlough or parole. Kaam bhi karta tha, beedi aur cigarette bhi khareed leta tha. On the whole, he had realised that here he had better behave.”

"Vicky Kaushal reveals key Masaan scene was shot without permission, says director Neeraj Ghaywan used his white T-shirt as reflector","Vicky Kaushal recalled how a key scene in Masaan was filmed with no production crew or permissions, and only the director and cinematographer present.","Actor Vicky Kaushal recalled how they shot a key scene in his breakout movie Masaan, which was directed by Neeraj Ghaywan and written by Varun Grover. In an interview with Pinkvilla, Vicky said that several scenes in the indie movie were shot guerilla-style, meaning that they didn’t have the proper permissions from authorities, but secretly got the footage they needed anyway. Vicky is no stranger to rogue productions, and famously got arrested as an assistant director while working on Anurag Kashyap’s Gangs of Wasseypur.
A scene in which Vicky’s character throws a ring into the river, the actor revealed, was shot impromptu with only Neeraj and cinematographer Avinash Arun present. He said that they had so little money at the time that he carried some of his own costumes in his suitcase. Vicky said that he wasn’t supposed to cry in the famous ‘dukh kahe khatam nahi hota be’ scene, and Neeraj also filmed another scene in which the tears were actually scripted, just so that he could have options on the edit table later. But because they had some time to themselves, Neeraj decided that they should film the second scene without him crying.

In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Pahlajj said that in order to get them to return, he hosted an impromptu ‘mahurat’ event for a film without a script or a director, got Mahesh Bhatt to attend as a decoy, and then got David Dhawan and Anees Bazmee to sign on out of FOMO.
Narrating the story in Hindi, he said, “Coincidentally, Govinda and Chunky Panday came to visit me when I was unwell. They were enemies at the time, but they both wanted to work with me. I came up with an idea in two days, and we did the ‘mahurat’ before anybody even knew who the director was. At the ‘mahurat’, David asked me, ‘Am I not doing the film?’ And I said, ‘No, Mahesh Bhatt is’.”

Talking about his father’s death on Unstoppable with NBK, Ranbir shared, “I think the loss of a parent is always the biggest low in a person’s life. So when I lost my father a couple of years ago… I don’t think I have still understood the loss. Because you know being a son… since the time you are born, you are always taught to be strong. You don’t express and say much. So I don’t know if I have really expressed my father’s loss yet to myself or to my loved ones.”

"Amol Palekar: Mr Everyman who made way for Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana; broke the barriers of Bollywood’s star system","As artist-actor-director Amol Palekar turns 79, we look back at his humble beginning, his training under theatre doyen Satyadev Dubey, his swift entry in world of cinema with Basu Chatterjee's Rajnigandha (1974) and his perfection in portraying the complexities of an ordinary man.","The 1970s are monumental in the history of Hindi cinema. It was an era that saw the emergence of ‘Angry Young Man’ Amitabh Bachchan and introduced stalwarts like Vinod Khanna, Manoj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor to movie buffs. But it was also an era where ordinary and real characters, who went beyond stardom to strike a genuine chord with the audience, rubbed shoulders with these larger-than-life onscreen stars. And such characters were skillfully aced by Amol Palekar — a name Gen Z would have heard due to the comparisons drawn with Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao.
With expertise for all things beautiful and artistic, which probably came from his training as a painter at the JJ School of Art in Mumbai, and long experience as a theatre artist, Palekar found himself uniquely placed to embody fluid masculinity and be an alternative to the Alpha male of Hindi cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. He had a winsome smile which radiated optimism. He resembled a boy-next-door who had accidentally strayed onto a movie set, and that is exactly how Palekar became an actor.

Animal advance box office collection: Ranbir Kapoor’s violent revenge saga expected to deliver career-best Rs 50 crore opening,Animal advance box office: Ranbir Kapoor is expected to deliver the biggest opening of his career with Sandeep Reddy Vanga's film.,"Ranbir Kapoor’s fans were enthralled earlier this week by the first trailer for his upcoming film, Animal. A romantic crime drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and co-starring Rashmika Mandanna, the film has been rated ‘A’ by the Central Board of Film Certification, a tag that the team is wearing like a badge of honour. Vanga courted controversy with his first two films, Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, and seems to be doubling down with Animal, which runs at nearly three-and-a-half hours long.
Vanga refused to compromise on the run time, after delivering a first cut that ran nearly four hours long. Long movies are significantly affected commercially, for the simple reason that distributors can fit fewer shows in a single day. Long movies rated ‘A’ are further impacted. But Animal will be a true test not only for Vanga, but also for Ranbir who is slowly clawing his way back to the A-list after a mixed run since Sanju. Advance bookings for the film will begin in India on Sunday, November 26. According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal is expected to generate Rs 50 crore on its opening day, which would easily be the biggest opening in Ranbir’s career. Advance bookings began in the US, and according to Koimoi, the movie has sold only 3,200 tickets for 206 locations so far. But it’s still very early days.

Ranbir has previously gotten a tattoo in Hindi on his wrist. Shortly before the release of his film Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani, Ranbir got a tattoo that read ‘Awaara’.

Ranbir is the grandson of Raj Kapoor. But a few years later, the actor said that he had no tattoos. When asked about tattoos, he told Mashable India in 2022, “None yet. Hopefully soon. The 8 or something I don’t know. Maybe my (tattoo is) going to be children’s names or I don’t know.”

Leo movie review: Adam Sandler’s mildly anarchic Netflix film tackles problematic parenting with silly songs and subversion,"Leo movie review: Voicing a dying lizard, Adam Sandler brings pathos to Netflix's cute but chaotic new animated film about problematic parenting.","Adam Sandler voices a curmudgeonly (but chaotic) lizard named Leo in Netflix’s new animated movie, co-directed by his old collaborator Robert Smigel. They previously worked together on a couple of those very successful Hotel Transylvania movies, whose zany humour Leo is also laced with. Neither a children’s movie nor something that their parents can enjoy without rolling their eyes at least once, Leo exists in a limbo of its own making.
Having settled into a complacent existence in a fifth-grade classroom that he has called home since 1949, Leo and his best friend Squirtle (voiced by Bill Burr) have seen batch after batch of 10-year-olds come and go. This has made them experts in the field of child anthropology. In just one glance, for instance, Leo can tell if someone is an only child who’s never been told to shut up or an insecure urchin acting out because they’ve been bullied themselves. Leo hasn’t ever taken an active interest in the children’s lives, but his standoffish attitude is given an unexpected shake when he learns one day that he basically has one year left to live.

Reflecting on his past struggles, Vijay told Galatta Plus, “It has always been about the role for me but one time when I was at my lowest low, I didn’t have any money, I had Rs 18 in my bank account and there was a call that came. They said there is a small reporter’s role and it’s a one-day job and you will get Rs 3000. I never wanted to play a role like that but I took it. I went and I started shooting. My heart wasn’t there, my conviction wasn’t there and I was fumbling in the take. ”

In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Kay Kay was asked if Haider was the film that brought him into a mixed space of commercial and art house cinema. To this, Kay Kay replied, “I don’t think so. First of all, the genesis of the word commercial is from commerce. So, what has done well is commercial.”

Kaathal The Core movie review: Mammootty and Jyotika outdo themselves in Jeo Baby’s landmark film,"Kaathal – The Core movie review: Jeo Baby's film, starring Mammootty and Jyotika, is a groundbreaking film that should be watched by all, particularly those in the film industry who continue to present recycled age-old narratives, expecting unquestioning acceptance from the audiences.","Ever wondered why many films addressing socially relevant themes struggle to connect with a broader audience? One key reason is their tendency to adopt a preachy approach, assuming the intellectual inferiority of the general public. Instead of allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a story and draw their own conclusions, these films tend to dictate the message.
Another issue lies in the setting. Often, when discussing topics such as sexual orientation and/or feminism, stories unfold in urban/elite environments with convenient narrative choices, wherein even initially problematic or elderly characters eventually shift to the right side expressing solidarity after the main characters deliver a ‘powerful’ speech. This approach un/intentionally implies that only the rich, educated or upper caste/class are likely to understand such matters and be open to changing their perspectives. But what happens when these matters arise in common households, in the lives of ordinary people who constitute a larger portion of the population? How would/should a working-class family respond to a member coming out?

Babil Khan on working with Kay Kay Menon: ‘He made me feel like I belonged here’,"The Railway Men, the first series from Yash Raj Films' digital arm YRF Entertainment, is directed by debutant Shiv Rawail.","Babil Khan says he was grappling with the loss of his father, actor Irrfan Khan when he started working on the Netflix show The Railway Men and credits his co-star Kay Kay Menon for creating an environment where he felt a sense of belonging.
During a press conference at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Wednesday evening, the actor revealed he had started working on the series about seven-eight months after his father’s demise.
Irrfan, a highly acclaimed and internationally renowned actor, passed away in April 2020 after a battle with a rare form of cancer.

Babil, who made his debut with the Netflix movie Qala and also starred in the streamer’s recent release Friday Night Plan, said he found solace on the set of The Railway Men.

“When I was working with Kay Kay sir on this series, I was going through a huge loss. I had lost my best friend and father in one day. It was seven or eight months before we started shooting for this,” the young actor told PTI here.
“When I would arrive on the set, that was the only time I felt like I belonged anywhere. When I was working with Kay Kay sir, that was the only time in that period of my life when I felt like I belonged. I think, to make a human being believe that they belong is the greatest gift you can give to them,” he added.
Menon, a contemporary of Irrfan and co-star of critically acclaimed titles like “Haider” and “Life in a… Metro,” praised Babil and said the upcoming actor possesses qualities that will take him to “great heights”.

“Babil is an individual in himself, and he has something that will take him to great heights. Once you have seen the series, you will realise that. For him, to preserve and maintain that spark of Irrfan is his journey.

“And that’s what I felt about him since I worked so closely with him. He is a man of the heart, and he will go a long way,” the star said.
The Railway Men, the first series from Yash Raj Films’ digital arm YRF Entertainment, directed by debutant Shiv Rawail, has received rave reviews since its premiere on Netflix last week.
Set against the backdrop of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak tragedy, the show pays tribute to the unsung heroes, the Indian railway employees posted at Bhopal station, who saved hundreds of innocent lives during that fateful night. It also stars R Madhavan and Divyenndu.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the initial phase of his career, Menon said he had worked on a story about the industrial disaster — in 1999’s Bhopal Express — but what made him take up the series was the fact that it highlighted the sacrifices of the railway employees.
“What drew me to this script was the banner of ‘The Railway Men’, which was unique as far as the series is concerned. This script gave space to those heroes who are unknown,” he added.
The actor believes people tend to “underestimate” the Indian Railways.
“We sit in a train and take them for granted, not knowing that it is a high-risk job that they are doing. It is very easy to pass snide remarks, but it is a high-precision and high-risk job. Their job is not just to take you from A to B but to take you there safely. So, it’s an added responsibility,” Menon said.

“So for me, when I chose to do this series, it was my homage to this particular organisation (Indian Railways) that we all take for granted, especially those railway men who sacrificed themselves to save people on that fateful night,” he added. IFFI will conclude on November 28.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/babil-khan-on-working-with-kay-kay-menon-he-made-me-feel-like-i-belonged-here-9039388/,entertainment

"‘Ranbir Kapoor a mix of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Kamal Haasan’: Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga",Ranbir Kapoor stars as the lead in Sandeep Reddy Vanga's upcoming film Animal.,"As an actor, Ranbir Kapoor has no limitations, says filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who believes he has presented the star in a never-seen-before avatar in their upcoming film Animal.
The movie revolves around a father and son and their troubled bond, played by Anil Kapoor and Ranbir. It is set against the backdrop of extreme bloodshed in the underworld.
The director, known for Vijay Devarakonda-starrer Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, starring Shahid Kapoor, said it was a pleasure to watch Kapoor transform into the total antithesis of himself in the role of Arjun Singh in Animal.

“Ranbir is a great actor, he is in a different league altogether. He is very original. I feel he is a mix of so many actors, it is wrong to compare to other actors, (But) I feel he is a mix of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Kamal Haasan. This man (Ranbir) has no limitation,” Vanga says.
He adds, “He doesn’t get angry like his character (in the film). He is a very calm person. I remember when I used to write rageful scenes, I would ask him so many times, ‘Ranbir, when do you get angry?’ He would say, ‘I don’t get angry, and Sandeep this is the 7th or 9th time you are asking me this’.”
Vanga says he was introduced to Kapoor’s work through Rockstar, in which the actor played the role of a musician struggling to find himself, spiritually and artistically.
“I saw two shows of Rockstar on the same day. I loved him and I told him about this. I never thought I would get to work with him. As a concept film, this is my second film. I’m glad I got to work with him this early. He had called me saying, ‘We should work (together)’. This is after Kabir Singh,” Vanga says.

“He had actually sent me a text message after Arjun Reddy, and I had not seen his message as it came from an unknown number. It was such a mistake. I was so happy when I learnt about it.” The movie also stars Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandanna.
Speaking about Bobby Deol, Vanga said Deol was always the first choice for the movie.
“He is a great guy. From day one, we had Bobby in mind. I had called him in 2020 or 2021, he was promoting Class of 83. For one of the scenes where he is bare-chested, we shot it in Scotland in minus three degrees. He came, he did the shot,” he added.
Produced by Kumar and Krishan Kumar’s T-Series, Murad Khetani’s Cine1 Studios and Pranay Reddy Vanga’s Bhadrakali Pictures, Animal will release theatrically on December 1 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vanga is happy with the reception the movie’s teaser has received and said he is eager to see how the public will react when “Animal” opens in theatres next month.
“I’m so happy that everybody is liking it. I gave more than three years for this film. It all feels good when people like your work. I think the film will be a blockbuster. It’s been a while since there has been a story about father and son,” he said.

This exchange highlights the toxic dynamic that they share, but also establishes the intensity with which the protagonist hero worships his dad. As the years go by, Ranbir’s character starts acting out, much to the concern of his parents. After his dad is attacked, Ranbir’s character vows to never leave his family’s side, and swears vengeance. It’s like The Godfather, but with a Punjabi rap video aesthetic.

On its 11th day of release, the film made Rs 5.7 crore across all languages in India, registering another marginal day-to-day drop. In total, Tiger 3 has made Rs 249 crore domestically, according to industry tracker Sacnilk.
Produced for a reported Rs 300 crore, the film had a large opening on Diwali, which happened to be a Sunday. It made Rs 44 crore, and seemed to be doing just fine until Bhai Dooj a couple of days later. But since then, it has struggled to maintain a steady pace at the box office, and was further hurt by Team India’s progress at the 2023 Men’s Cricket World Cup. The film’s daily collections dropped below the Rs 20 crore mark by day five, and below the Rs 10 crore mark by day nine.

Rustin movie review: Barack Obama-produced Netflix film doesn’t do justice to Colman Domingo’s fiery central performance,"Rustin movie review: Poorly directed but passionately performed, Netflix's biopic of the overlooked Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin lets star Colman Domingo down with subpar storytelling.","At one point in the new Netflix film Rustin, the titular character — civil rights activist Bayard Rustin — is described as ‘a shark trapped in a shot glass’. The architect of the 1963 March on Washington, best known outside the United States as the venue for Martin Luther King Jr’s “I have a dream” speech, Rustin channeled all his personal angst as a gay Black man and a fiercely passionate social reformer into the movement. Unfortunately, director George C Wolfe’s by-the-numbers biopic is the very shot glass in which its star, Colman Domingo, finds himself trapped.
Long overdue for a role like this, Domingo is by far the best thing about the movie, which, as you unfortunately grow to learn over its hour-and-a-half run-time, isn’t exactly a flattering comparison. His performance highlights the charismatic eccentricity of Rustin, whose long battle for equality unfolded mostly behind-the-scenes. Despite his immense contributions, he remains an underrepresented figure in history textbooks, some of which he is apparently being written out of. And it’s thanks in part to executive producers Barack and Michelle Obama that Rustin was able to get off the ground.

"Vetrimaaran: ‘Not responsible for hype, trying to keep myself intact’",Vetrimaaran says he is aware of the expectations that viewers have from him but he tries to stay away from the hype surrounding his work.,"Filmmaker Vetrimaaran, known for his nuanced take on pertinent social issues through films such as Asuran, Vada Chennai and Visaranai, says he is aware of the expectations that viewers have from him but he tries to stay away from the hype surrounding his work.
Vetrimaaran presented his latest film Viduthalai: Part One at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Wednesday.
“I’m not responsible for the expectation and the hype, and I’m not working on it or creating it. I don’t have Twitter (now X). I was on Facebook but I’m happy someone hacked my account. So I’m trying to keep myself intact,” Vetrimaaran told reporters at a press conference here.

But there are times when the pressure gets to him, the filmmaker admitted.
“Sometimes, it does put a pressure unconsciously when I’m working on the final cut. During the release, I find it really hard to sleep. It is an unconscious stress. But once the film is over, I get out of it. I don’t watch my films after the release or read reviews,” he said.

Viduthalai: Part One, starring Vijay Sethupathi, Soori, Gautham Vasudev Menon and Bhavani Sre, is part of the Indian Panaroma lineup at the festival.
Vidhuthalai is set in 1987 in Tamil Nadu and follows the police crackdown on The People’s Army, an armed anti-government outfit, that poses a big threat to the stability of the government in the region.

It follows Kumaresan (Soori), a new police recruit, who feels conflicted by the actions of police.
Vetrimaaran said he wanted to make a quick film during the COVID pandemic .
“This story I chose to write the script on was a novel written by B Jeyamohan and it was called Thunaivan. I assumed that the rights would be with him to give it to me. I started working on the script. And then halfway through, I realised that I should ask him first. I called him and asked him and he said he had given it to someone else.” After that, he reworked the script along with Jeyamohan.
“So initially, my idea was to make a film on a police outpost in a forest where three people are working, and one guy brings in food and goes away. So it was supposed to be only in that outpost. But then I started working backwards. there is one guy who brings food every day for these people. Let me follow him, follow his journey into this world…He gets to understand the difference between what is said and what exists and through him we also get to understand the world, the people and the politics,” he said.

Vetrimaaran said the film is still a work in progress and he is currently shooting for part two.
“When I watched the film, I know that it has gone wrong here, then I’m thinking, ‘Okay, I’ll have to rectify it in the second part.’ So it’s still a work in progress,” he added.
The filmmaker also decoded his process of working on a story and how it differs from adapting a novel.
“If I decide to make a story around a particular group of people or a geographical scape, then I go there and see the people and the place. I work there for one or two years to understand the place and the people..”

If the story doesn’t work for him, then the filmmaker starts working on it all over again.
“This is a long process. Whereas a novelist or a story writer has done all the research for me and put it into the novel. He has condensed his life’s work into few hundred pages or even less,” he said.

Vetrimaaran, 48, also talked about why he decided to rope in actor Soori for the main role in Vidhuthalai Part 1. The actor was earlier known for comedic parts in many Tamil films.
“When I want to do a film with someone, then I need to understand what kind of person this actor is and that is very important, especially when you are putting an actor in a zone they are not used to.

“Ideally, I want them to be themselves in front of the camera. I don’t want them to be someone else they are not from within. Soori comes across as a very simple person… Soori’s personality seeped into the character when I was writing the script,” the director said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/vetrimaaran-not-responsible-for-hype-trying-to-keep-myself-intact-9038385/,entertainment
Katrina Kaif reflects on her 20 years in Bollywood: ‘I’m very competitive but sometimes I remind myself to take a moment’,Katrina Kaif has twice the reason to celebrate the year 2023 with her completion of 20 years in Bollywood and the success of her film Tiger 3.,"As someone who started acting when she was just a teenager, actor Katrina Kaif says she is very driven and competitive but over the years, she has learned to enjoy the “wonderful journey” she has had in Hindi cinema.
There are many films that helped her grow, says Katrina, who completed 20 years in Bollywood this year. She counts New York, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Rajneeti, Singh is Kinng, Namastey London, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Zero among major milestones in her career.
“I’ve been really fortunate and because I’m such a driven person, I’m constantly looking around me. You compare yourself, it is but natural because if you are a very driven and competitive person, you never rest with yourself. You are always pushing yourself… But sometimes I remind myself to take that moment to think and appreciate that I’ve been given so much and I’ve earned it as well. It has been a wonderful journey that I’m very grateful for,” Katrina Kaif told PTI in an interview.

The 40-year-old actor, who started as a model before making her movie debut in 2003 with Boom, has had enviable filmography by starring in movies such as Namastey London, Partner, Welcome and Singh Is Kinng.

The actor said she has always been “obsessive” about her work to the point where it has become her identity. She also said she finds acting to be an extremely demanding career.
“I believe personally it’s the demand of the profession, (that) you have to be consumed with your craft as an actor. If you are not consumed with the film, I think the gap shows somewhere on screen. Also, I think it’s my nature. I’m very obsessive about things when it comes to my work. I get consumed by it so much, people have to tell me, ‘Go home, everyone’s tired now’.
“I guess my work has been my identity. I started when I was very young. Before I was 17-year-old, I had started my career and when something gives you your identity then that becomes part of your core, that becomes who you are. You are always tuned and trained to kind of inherently fight for that and protect that,” she added.

When asked what advice she would give to her younger self—who is about to embark on her acting career—Katrina Kaif replied, “Enjoy the moment.”
“I had a great time… I was having a blast. I look back at those moments and I had so much fun. The only thing maybe, I can tell myself, ‘Enjoy this moment’ because in those days there was no social media so we just stayed in the moment.”
Post Tiger 3, Kaif has three films in pipeline including Sriram Raghavan-directed thriller Merry Christmas, Jee Le Zaara co-starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Alia Bhatt, and a film as well with director Alia Abbas Zafar.
Katrina Kaif said she is excited for the future and what it holds for her as an actor.

“I’m very happy as long as I’m making choices that are honest to who I’m today. I’m making choices from a balanced and calm place, a happy space, so that’s always good. (I’m) excited for the future. Excited to see how I can evolve as an artiste. What new dimension I can bring on screen and what new dimension I can bring to my work. I am looking forward to that,” she added.

In a recent interview, Ronit recalled the time he spent with Hrithik on the shoot of the film. Ronit said that although he had known the actor for many years, he had never worked with the star so when he landed up on set, he found it best to address him as ‘sir’. But this didn’t go well with Hrithik as he objected to it the next day.
“I was cast in a film where he is the star so you don’t really know what to do so you take the safe route. So I said, ‘Good morning, sir.’ He is the lead of the film so the safest way is to call him sir,” Ronit shared with Lehren Retro. The actor said that he had spent time with Hrithik before but the two had actually never worked together. He recalled that the after the first day went by, Hrithik called him to his van the next day.

Vir Das on International Emmy win for Best Comedy: ‘I hope we all just get sillier’,Vir Das won the award for his Netflix stand-up special Vir Das: Landing in the best comedy category at a ceremony in New York on Monday night. He tied with the much acclaimed British series Derry Girls for the coveted prize.,"He’s still “just a guy on a stool” for whom the audience’s laughter will always be more precious than accolades, says Vir Das, the first Indian comic to win an International Emmy Award.
Das won the award for his Netflix stand-up special Vir Das: Landing in the best comedy category at a ceremony in New York on Monday night. He tied with the much acclaimed British series Derry Girls for the coveted prize.
“The job is to take the beautiful chosen people of the world and humanise them a little bit by making an idiot out of myself… I hope we all just get sillier and continue to be fools,” the actor-comic, who returned home on Wednesday, told PTI in a virtual interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
The future of the Indian comedy scene is “tremendous”, the 41-year-old said.

“I’m underslept. The phone has been going a little insane. But I’m just grateful. I don’t think anything has fully sunk in yet. Luckily, I have a long flight back to India to process all of it.”
An award, he said, is a gift and recognition laughter.
“In my speech, I made sure to thank the Indian people for their laughter. I said it was the soundtrack to my life,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Injecting a note of reality as he celebrates his first International Emmy trophy, Vir Das said it will get him “maybe 30 seconds extra applause” when he walks out on the stage. After that, it will only be about the laughs.
“I will have to make them (the audience) laugh. At the end of the day, they will be like, ‘We have paid for this, so make us laugh.'”
Das, who has often courted trouble over his quirky, observational performances and social media posts, is already readying for shows in Chandigarh and Bengaluru.
He was one of the three Indians to be nominated at the 51st International Emmy Awards along with Shefali Shah for Delhi Crime season two (Netflix) and Jim Sarbh for Rocket Boys (SonyLIV). Besides, producer Ektaa R Kapoor of Balaji Productions was honoured with the International Emmy Directorate Award.

The comic said there was “a bit of suspense” at the awards gala when the winner for best comedy category was going to be announced because two envelopes made an appearance on the stage all of a sudden.

“I tied with ‘Derry Girls’, one of the best shows in the world,” he added.

That they were surprised to hear their name called out is generally a cliched response but the comedian said he only went to the International Emmy Awards with the intent to root for Shefali Shah, who was vying for a win in the best performance by an actress category. She was bested by Karla Souza of La Caida, a Mexican show.
“I really considered my job to be there to root for Shefali. She is a once-in-a-generation talent… I was just kind of focusing my energy on her. I was genuinely surprised (when I won).
“As much as Netflix India is gigantic and has a worldwide footprint, I’m still just a guy on a stool. So, to be in a category with Derry Girls, which is a massive Netflix show, itself is an achievement. So, when they said (the winner is) Vir Das: Landing, I was very, very surprised,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vir Das kind of fumbled his way up to the stage, but he got his thank yous right which was very important.
“I said many things. The second I got off the stage, I panicked (wondering) did I thank everyone? I hope I didn’t mess it up. (I said to myself) No, you thanked your wife, your family, Netflix and everybody who worked on it.”
Vir Das: Landing is Das’ fourth special with Netflix. This was his second nod at the International Emmys; first one, also with the streamer, was for Vir Das: For India in 2021.
Through Vir Das: Landing, the aim was to tell the world what his “idea of home” is, the comic said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He was born in Dehradun and spent the first 14 years of his life in Lagos, Nigeria. He has also lived in Haryana, Delhi-NCR, and the US.
Das, who is now based out of Mumbai, said he is fortunate to be a “global Indian comedy voice”.
“I get to travel the world. It’s a tremendous privilege. What that comes with is I spend eight months a year missing home sometimes during a world tour. The germ of the show is from there. I miss home and a lot of times if I’m in New York or London, there are 3,000 people in the room, out of which 1,500 are Indians who haven’t been in a room with so many Indians in a really long time. You are their catch-up, their update with home. That’s what the central feeling of the show was. I don’t think there could be a better stage for the show to get some love than an international stage,” he said.
His win comes almost a month after the sudden demise of popular American actor and comedian Matthew Perry. The late actor is best known for the popular 1990s sitcom Friends, in which he played the iconic role of socially awkward but amiable Chandler Bing who uses sarcasm to get by in life.
ADVERTISEMENT
Das, who had shared a heartfelt tribute for Perry on social media after his passing, said the Friends star essayed his part like a lovable fool.
“The jester’s job, the joker’s job, the fool’s job is to make fun of people to make them seem beautiful. That’s what Matthew Perry did very well in a scene. He made the other person look good by being how silly he could be.”
Vir Das, also known for films such as Go Goa Gone, Delhi Belly, and Love Aaj Kal, has several acting projects lined up for 2024.
“I just wrapped up a show which should be out soon… I co-directed a feature that goes on floor in February that I’ll star in. It will be my co-directorial debut of sorts. I should have an American piece of content out soon too. It (2024) is an acting year, a heavy acting year,” he said.

While the Primetime Emmy Awards recognise shows produced in America, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences conducts the International Emmys with the aim to honour “the world’s best television”.

Mani Ratnam on box office collections: ‘It’s disappointing that even audiences are talking about numbers’,"Mani Ratnam, Mari Selvaraj, Vetrimaaran, Sudha Kongara, Madonne Ashwin, and PS Vinothraj came together for a roundtable discussion to talk about the recent trends in Tamil cinema.","Seldom does Mani Ratnam get candid and share his perspectives about things as he belongs to the breed of filmmakers for whom ‘film does the talking’. However, in a recent round table interaction, the filmmaker shared his two cents about the ongoing obsession with box office numbers among the audience.
The round table, organised by Galatta Plus, was attended by Mani Ratnam, Vetrimaaran, Mari Selvaraj, Sudha Kongara, Madonne Ashwin, and PS Vinothraj. They were asked their opinion on the trend of casting big stars to mint moolah at the box office. Vetrimaaran said that post COVID, the market has changed and audiences want to come to theatres only for big star films. He added that it is good for the market and cinema as it generates a lot of money in the industry which increases the salary of everyone.
However, he noted that the lifetime collection of a film like his Viduthalai will not even be as much as the opening day collection of a big star’s film. “When we invest Rs 10 crore, why do we want it to do Rs 100 crore? Why can’t we be happy with Rs 15 crore or Rs 18 crore?” he said.

Mani Ratnam, on the other hand, was disappointed that the box office has become a subject for the audience. “What is a bit disappointing is that, including the audience, everyone is talking about numbers. Is it a good film or a bad film? Did you enjoy it or not? Is it relevant? Is it required for us to grow? The discussions have gone beyond all this”
Mari Selvaraj, however, interrupted and said that he is not sure whether audiences are discussing numbers. “I don’t think in places like Thirunelveli, they discuss number.

The couple dated each other for a few years before tying the knot.,"Kiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra did not make their relationship public until they tied the knot earlier this year but during Sidharth’s appearance on Koffee with Karan, Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan spoke about the love story that was hidden from the world for the longest time. Karan recalled that he once threw a party which was being attended by both Sid and Kiara, even though they were in a fight with each other.
Karan recalled that as they sat with each other and made up, he was certain that they were meant to be together. “I remember they (Sidharth and Kiara) were having a fight, he was having a high fever, and he had come to my party. But it was very sweet, because two hours later they were sitting together and she was feeding him. At that point, I realised that this is going to happen, they are going to happen,” he said.
Varun Dhawan also recalled the incident where Kiara was quite excited to see Sidharth and he wondered what’s cooking between the two as Sid had high fever at the time but he was still making the effort to come and see her. He shared, “Exactly, we were shooting a song, we finished shooting and we were heading back. She (Kiara) was so happy, like Sid is going to come there, bechara he has a high fever. She had told me you were unwell. Someone was telling me that Sidharth with a high fever coming to a party to meet a girl matlab kuch toh hai yaar (that means there is something).”
Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani starred together in the Vikram Batra biopic Shershah that got them a lot of acclaim for their performances. Sidharth and Kiara got married in February 2023 at Jaisalmer’s Suryagarh Palace in the company of close friends and family.

"Sunny Deol reveals he has dyslexia, gets his dialogues in Hindi: ‘People would think ki yeh duffer aadmi hai’",Sunny Deol revealed that he is dyslexic and which is why he gets his dialogue in Hindi and reads the many times before delivering them in front of the camera.,"It has been a great year for Sunny Deol. The actor marked a return to the silver screen with Gadar 2, which turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the year. Similarly, Sunny’s father Dharmendra and brother Bobby Deol made a mark with their roles in films Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani and Animal, respectively. In a recent conversation, Sunny revealed that he is dyslexic and which is why he gets his dialogue in Hindi and reads the many times before delivering them in front of the camera.
In a recent conversation with Bombay Times, Sunny Deol opened up about his approach to acting, dismissing the trend of extensive research that some actors indulge in before portraying a character. Drawing inspiration from yesteryear actors, including his father, who did back-to-back films without extensive preparation, Sunny labeled such research as “gibberish.” He emphasised that, except for biographical characters, he prefers interpreting roles in his unique way without meticulous research.
The actor went on to reveal that he doesn’t have dialogues of his films as he is dyslexic. He shared that he can’t read and write properly. He also shed light on the challenges he faced in his academic journey. He said, “Earlier, we didn’t know what it was, and people would think..ki yeh duffer aadmi hai.” Sunny shared that he navigates his dyslexia by receiving his dialogues in Hindi, meticulously reading them multiple times to internalise and deliver them in the front of the camera.

Earlier, in an interview with Ranveer Allahbadia, Sunny had shared how he would also often get “slapped” for not scoring well in studies, but no one really knew what dyslexia event meant back then.
He said, “I was dyslexic as a child. Back then, we didn’t even know what that meant! Thappad padte the, duffer hai, padhai nahi aati (I would get slapped, called duffer for not being able to study). Even now when it comes to reading, sometimes the words seem all jumbled up. Often people say to use a teleprompter (at public gathering) but I refuse! I am like, ‘You tell me what to say, I will try to say it.’”

Why do Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma come across as the perfect couple?,"In a country where cricket and cinema are revered as religions, the union of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma inevitably sparked a firestorm of attention. However, it's their approach towards their relationship that serves as an inspiration for many.","Right after India lost the World Cup final to Australia, I found my heartbroken husband looking for videos of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli from the tournament. It was an unusual sight considering he has never shown an interest in actors, let alone their personal lives, and second, he judges those of us who do. Yet, he was captivated by this couple, and especially Anushka, who didn’t just blew flying kisses to her husband when he scored his 50th century but also embraced him tightly when he sought solace after the final defeat. Talk about couple goals!
But why do Virat and Anushka come across as the perfect couple every time the camera captures them? After all, there are other equally famous and revered Bollywood jodis. There can be no single answer to this question. It’s perhaps how they articulate their relationship in interviews and how fans align their words with actions caught on camera.

"IFFK 2023: Ghaath director Chhatrapal Ninawe expresses dissatisfaction over ‘poor projection, sound quality’ at govt’s film theatre","Ghaath revolves around the tense interplay between Maoist guerrillas, civilians and the police in Indian forests.","Marathi filmmaker Chhatrapal Ninawe’s debut feature Ghaath (Ambush) was screened at the ongoing 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday night.
A film that underwent significant hurdles before its world premiere at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival in February this year, Ghaath revolves around the tense interplay between Maoist guerrillas, civilians and the police in Indian forests.

After garnering positive reviews at Berlinale, the film made its way to Kerala for a screening at the IFFK as part of the Indian Cinema Now category. However, during the screening at the Kalabhavan Theatre in Thiruvananthapuram late Saturday night, some unfortunate incidents occurred and the director expressed complete dissatisfaction with the projection and sound quality in the hall.

Following the film screening, a Q&A session was scheduled at the theatre, and Ninawe, who was present there while the film was being played as well, took the opportunity to criticise how the film had been presented.

“I am thankful to the viewers for staying through the entire premiere, as I might not have done the same. I came to IFFK with great expectations, but the projection quality was disappointingly poor and the sound quality was the worst I have ever encountered. It’s such a shame. It doesn’t matter that you provided me with accommodation at a big hotel. I am ready to sleep even on the floor. However, compromising on screening quality is unacceptable,” he said, addressing the viewers before storming out of the hall.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Chhatrapal Ninawe reiterated his dissatisfaction, stating, “I believe this theatre has an incredible legacy, and these issues are easily fixable. It’s unfortunate that they weren’t addressed. My sound designer (Manoj M Goswami) worked on the Baahubali movies, so you can imagine how meticulously we crafted Ghaath’s sound. It’s unfortunate that the audience couldn’t fully experience it.”
At the outset, the theatre also had to briefly halt the screening and restart the projection as the wrong aspect ratio was initially chosen.

Aattam review: A magnificent film that brilliantly explores male hypocrisy,"There's no simple way to describe Anand Ekarshi's Aattam. It is both a play and a movie. It is also a play within a play within a movie. It is also a courtroom drama, albeit sans a courtroom. However, above all, Aattam stands out as one of the most brilliant Malayalam movies in recent times.","Just when you believe you’ve unravelled a character in this film and understood their true nature, they utter something incredibly banal or logical, completely shattering your perceptions of them. It’s only after a certain point that we realise they are like us and we are like them — taking stances and forming opinions based on convenience and how much of ours is at stake.
There’s no simple way to describe Anand Ekarshi’s debut feature Aattam (The Play), which was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK). At its core, the film revolves around a woman who faces sexual assault in a space she had considered safe. Simultaneously, it is about a group of men who come together to ‘discuss’ or ‘investigate’ the matter. At the same time, it is also about the insensitivity with which a patriarchal society responds to such cases. The film also exposes male hypocrisy and how men, ultimately, wield influence even in matters they lack understanding of. It also highlights the issue of men not knowing when to shut up and the denial of opportunities for women to speak. Aattam, simultaneously, shows how the burden consistently falls on women to prove the authenticity of their experiences, whereas men often receive a free pass without needing any explanations. Aattam is both a play and a movie, like KG George’s all-time classic Yavanika (1982). It is also a play within a play within a movie. The film can be likened to a courtroom drama too, albeit sans a courtroom. However, above all, it stands out as one of the most brilliant Malayalam movies in recent times.

Ronit Roy says he lived out of his car as he didn’t have money for rent: ‘Would use public washrooms to freshen up and go to shoots’,"Ronit Roy, who later had a breakthrough with Kasautii Zindagii Kay as Rishabh Bajaj, said he would live in his car with all his clothes packed in a huge suitcase.","The origin story of Ronit Roy’s 2.0 phase can be traced back to his car, which the actor says was turned into his living space as he had no money to rent a house in the early stages of his career in the film industry. Ronit Roy, who had a breakthrough with the popular TV show Kasautii Zindagii Kay as Rishabh Bajaj, said he would live in his car with all his clothes packed in a huge suitcase. Asking to stay at a friend’s place was never an option as Ronit said it was “shameful” and he had a lot of self-respect.
This weirdly happened after Ronit had a successful debut with Jaan Tere Naam, but the stardom went away after a series of missteps, like excessive drinking.
“Nobody helped me, asked me, ‘Is there food in your house? Do you even have a house?’ I didn’t even have a house for the longest time, I was living in a car! I had one big suitcase, it used to be in the boot of my car and all my clothes were in it. Because I had to leave the place where I was earlier living as I didn’t have money to pay rent. I could not go back to someone’s house and say please let me stay. It is shameful. On and off would use the hotels in Juhu, all the public lavatories to freshen up and go to shoots,” he said in an interview with Lehren Retro.

The 58-year-old actor said back then sets didn’t have vanity vans and the locations he was shooting in were places like a school. “There I would ask for a bucket to bathe, make my hair. It was tough.
“That’s why I have a very good laugh when the media time would ask, ‘This transition from film to TV, it must have been very difficult to come down to TV?’ I was completely unemployed, I had nothing! TV was actually a blessing and a boon to me,” he added.
Post Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Ronit Roy went on to star in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi as Mihir Virani and later had a successful comeback to the big screen with Vikramaditya Motwane’s 2010 drama Udaan.

"Ronit Roy opens up on struggle with alcohol, recalls arriving hungover on set: ‘I would be drinking four hours before the shoot’","Ronit Roy opened up on his career downfall and his casual approach towards success, leading him to indulge in alcohol.","Actor Ronit Roy carved a niche for himself by portraying two of the most iconic characters in the history of Indian television – Mihir Virani from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Rishabh Bajaj from Kasautii Zindagii Kay. While many remember him for his television roles, Ronit initiated his career in films with the 1992 blockbuster Jaan Tere Naam. Despite a promising start in the entertainment industry, Ronit Roy faced a downfall due to his casual approach towards success, leading him to indulge in alcohol. This phase lasted for nine years until he found his breakthrough in television, eventually marking his big comeback.
In a recent interview with Lehren Retro, Ronit opened up about his struggle with alcohol, recalling instances where he would arrive on set after a night of drinking. He said, “I didn’t understand success. I became a hero and I never thought it would end. When you are drinking you make a host of other mistakes. One mistake I never made is that I have never been late for a shoot but, despite reaching on time, I didn’t have my faculties around me because I would be drinking four hours before the shoot. I didn’t sleep and my eyes would be bulging. You are not supposed to look like that. There is a responsibility on you. People come to theatres to watch you and you have to give back to them.”

"20,000 Species of Bees, exploring a transgirl’s summer, affirms that seeking acceptance for one’s self is reasonable","Express at IFFK: Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren's debut feature 20,000 Species of Bees is a heartwarming film that sheds light on the struggles trans kids go through as they begin to understand their identity, and how near and dear ones can leave a positive impact on their lives by LISTENING.","“Can I die and be reborn as a girl,” little Lucia (Sofía Otero) asks her great-aunt Lourdes (Ane Gabarain) in a heartwrenchingly innocent manner, encapsulating the emotional turmoil she grapples with regularly. Spanish filmmaker Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren’s debut feature 20.000 especies de abejas (20,000 Species of Bees), centres around Lucia, her quest to discover her true self and her family members’ efforts to come to terms with the changes and the attempts of a few to be there for her in the ways possible to them.
A heartwarming film that sheds light on the struggles trans kids go through as they begin to understand their identity, and how near and dear ones can leave a positive impact on their lives, easing their journey in a world where they face constant questioning, bullying, scrutiny and harassment, 20,000 Species of Bees emphasises that loved ones need to do only two fundamental things to help them — LISTEN and accept them for who they are or aspire to be.
In an interview with The Guardian earlier this year, Solaguren mentioned that the core idea of the film developed after she learned about the suicide of a 16-year-old trans boy in the Basque Country, Spain, where she lives. She recalled that he took the drastic step to “shine some light on people in his situation, for visibility.” While it’s distressing to even contemplate the need for someone to resort to such extremes for visibility, this is not an isolated incident; there have been numerous cases where victims, subjected to social injustice and cyber attacks, have taken similar measures.

India too is no haven. 16-year-old queer kid and self-taught makeup artist Pranshu and Kerala’s first transgender bodybuilder Praveen Nath were indeed victims of everything wrong with a heteronormative and transphobic society that still persists even today.
Hence, the 2023 Spanish drama gains relevance as it effectively portrays compassion as a simple yet potent tool capable of helping trans kids, or any kid grappling with crises incomprehensible for others, accept themselves without shame.
Screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), 20,000 Species of Bees is mostly set in the Basque Country during a sweltering summer when Lucia, accompanied by her mother Ane (Patricia López Arnaiz) and two siblings, visits her maternal family. Amidst a backdrop of buzzing bees, Lucia comes to realise her identity as a girl and desires to be treated accordingly. She rejects her birth name, Aitor, and is not happy with the nickname Cocó either. Though initially unable to express what she is going through, Lucia slowly begins communicating with her great-aunt Lourdes (Ane Gabarain) as she is the only one who listens to her without any judgments.
ADVERTISEMENT
Struggling with discomfort in her evolving body, Lucia, initially averse to hugs and kisses, eventually expresses affection through physical touch to Lourdes when she asserts that she doesn’t have to die and be reborn to live as a girl. However, despite Ane’s persistent efforts to support Lucia, Ane’s own identity crisis, entangled with professional and personal challenges, hinders her ability to truly hear Lucia. This emotional gap leads Lucia to distance herself from her mother a bit, emphasising that what she craves is not advice or correction but simply a pair of ears and a heart that genuinely LISTENS.
Where the film shines the most is in its ability to communicate many things through seemingly small and subtle moments, conversations and emotional expressions. For example, at a significant juncture in the film, Lucia goes missing, leading the worried family to search for her in a forest. While the rest of her family loudly calls out the name Aitor, Ane realises that Lucia won’t respond to that name. Despite informing her husband Gorka (Martxelo Rubio), he struggles to accept that his son identifies as a girl, intensifying Ane’s distress. Amid the chaos, Lucia’s brother Eneko (Unax Hayden) boldly calls out for her using the name “Lucia”, without hesitation, sparking a shift in everyone’s perspectives. It’s only then that even Ane starts addressing her as Lucia, emphasising the importance of initiating change from a young age.

While Solaguren adeptly captures the essence of the serene yet unhappening setting, avoiding any loud or preachy elements that might compromise the film’s simple yet significant core, it is little Sofía Otero to whom the film ultimately belongs. Portraying the character Lucia with utmost brilliance to the extent that one can hardly believe it’s her debut film, Otero effectively brings out the struggles of a transgender child with maximum precision. She won the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival this year, becoming the youngest person to bag the award.
In another poignant scene, as family members are outside their room quarrelling about Lucia, an extremely heart-wrenched child can be seen lying on the bed, sobbing, while Eneko lies next to her trying to comfort her in ways possible for his young self. This moment emphasises how challenging it is for children to endure such disputes among family members, especially when the matters concern them directly. Otero’s performance here is sure to impact viewers profoundly as she melts into the bed, her face red from crying.

While Patricia López Arnaiz and Ane Gabarain deliver outstanding performances, Gina Ferrer’s cinematography is certain to captivate viewers. Meanwhile, Izaskun Urkijo’s art direction enhances the movie’s mood and tone, transforming it into an impressive cinematic experience.
By clearly reminding viewers that there are about 20,000 species of bees around us, each with its own uniqueness and strengths, Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren delivers a powerful message through this drama that trans lives matter.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/20000-species-of-bees-exploring-a-transgirls-summer-affirms-that-seeking-acceptance-for-ones-self-is-reasonable-9061922/,entertainment

As parents, we will obviously feel this.’ And I told them I am not doing anything wrong. It’s my job and as long as I am comfortable and safe, I don’t see any problem in that. I am an actor and I have to be 100 percent honest with the character that I play and I did that.”

Rashmika recently took to social media to defend Animal and share insights about her character Gitanjali in the film. She wrote, “She is pure, real, unfiltered, strong and raw.. At times as an actor, I would question some of Gitanjali’s actions.. And I remember my director telling me – this was their story.. Ranvijay’s & Gitanjali’s.. it was their love and passion, their families and their lives – this is who they are.” Animal has been facing a lot of criticism from critics and the audience for glorifying toxic masculinity and for being excessively violent and gory.

But before commencing work on the film and even during production, Nelson had significant doubts about how he would project Rajinikanth on the big screen. His creative choices were questioned by members of his own crew, and he was advised to let Rajinikanth do what he does best and not experiment.
In a new interview, Nelson shared how he stuck to his guns and didn’t allow anyone to muddle his vision. He shared with Film Companion that he always wanted to make a film with Rajinikanth. Once the script was completed, Nelson had doubts even during the shoot. He shared, “This is the first time I made him play his age, that was the major doubt in me because people told me, ‘Don’t make him play his age. Let him do whatever he has done already. Don’t grey his hair.’ But I was like, even if it has to fail, let it be with my gut, I will take the blame. I didn’t want someone to confuse me.”

In the sequence, Rajinikanth is seen sitting at a dining table with his wife and daughter-in-law and a dead body falls on them. “I thought about staging that scene for a month. I wanted Rajini sir to be cool in that whole film. Rather than him fighting, whatever happens around him should be more interesting and never seen before in his films. I myself wrote the whole stunt and scripted the whole scene,” shared Nelson.

However, on the day of the shoot, the fight choreographer asked Nelson, “Is it okay that Rajini sir is not doing anything?” Not just him, “Many people asked if Rajini sir (should be given something to do) at least. These decisions were a little difficult for me, but I liked the staging of that situation.” Nelson went with his gut and ended up delivering a massive hit.

Prem Chopra was hesitant to play one-scene part in Bobby; Raj Kapoor joked after it became a hit: ‘You hijacked the film’,"When Raj Kapoor offered Prem Chopra a special appearance in Bobby, the actor was worried that it might dent his reputation.","Veteran actor Prem Chopra became the go-to guy for villainous characters in the 1970s. So, when the legendary Raj Kapoor approached him to make a special appearance in Rishi Kapoor’s launch vehicle, Bobby, Chopra was hesitant. He was worried about doing a special appearance in a film at the peak of his career, and thought other producers would also start offering him only special appearances in their films. But Raj Kapoor was adamant that Chopra should play the part in his film.
During a recent appearance on the Timeout With Ankit podcast, Chopra revealed that he was initially excited when Kapoor offered him a role in Bobby, “Who wouldn’t want to work with Raj Kapoor?” he said. But, the twist in the tale came when Kapoor told Chopra that his role would be short. The actor expressed his hesitance to Kapoor. “At that time, I was doing equal roles with Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Jeetendra and Dharmendra. I told him, ‘Raj ji, if I will do a special appearance in your film, then the other producers who have been giving me work regularly might say, ‘You have done a special appearance in Raj Kapoor’s film, now do the same for us’,” the actor shared. But Kapoor didn’t take no for an answer, and told him, “Tujhe karna hai toh karna hi hai (I don’t care, you will have to do it).”

However, one area where the film fell short was in its exploration of the relationship between Mathew (Mammootty) and his lover Thankan (Sudhi Kozhikode). Even in our review of the movie, we noted that “a more in-depth exploration of the relationship between Mathew and his partner was undoubtedly needed.”

Discussing the deliberate decision to avoid portraying any personal moments or on-screen interactions between Mathew and Thankan, director Jeo Baby explained during the Film Companion directors’ adda, “The screenplay was precisely designed this way. In it, they never meet but watch each other from a distance. The script was crafted by Adarsh Sukumaran and Paulson Skaria. Mammootty was the first choice that came to my mind. I needed Mammootty as both the actor and the human being for this film. After narrating the story to him, he not only suggested some changes but also became deeply involved in its further development. He actively participated in numerous discussions, even sending WhatsApp messages to me occasionally with suggestions. His support was truly invaluable. For instance, during the interval portion, Mammootty proposed allowing them to share a moment of eye contact. Although we had already written something, we made that change based on his suggestion, and it worked in our favour.

In an interview, he also said that he didn’t want to repeat the same mistakes as his father.
In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Bobby shared how his relationship with sons Aryaman and Dharam is different from the one he had with his father, Dharmendra, during the formative years. “When I was growing up, it was a different scenario all together,” said Bobby, adding, “There was respect that you had to keep for your parents. You cannot go beyond certain things. With your mothers, you can still fight, still argue. Mothers are made like that, but fathers ke saath always jhijhak (hesitation) rehti thi.”

"Rajesh Khanna was habitually late to work, says Prem Chopra; reveals how producers would greet him on set: ‘Pehle lunch ke shooting?’","Recalling Rajesh Khanna's fading stardom, his frequent co-star, Prem Chopra, said in an interview, ""He was getting frustrated during that time.""","Veteran actor Prem Chopra, who was recently seen in Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal, has opened up about his long and successful partnership with the late superstar Rajesh Khanna. In an interview, he shared that while Khanna was the Hindi film industry’s first superstar, he could not make the necessary adjustments when he stardom started to fade. Prem Chopra and Rajesh Khanna have done over 20 films together, including Haathi Mere Saathi, Do Raaste, Kati Patang, Ajanabee, Souten, Krati and Purab aur Paschim.
In an appearance on the Timeout With Ankit Podcast, Prem Chopra shared how Rajesh Khanna had a habit of being late to work. He said, “We did 25 films together out of which 20 were superhits. It was a good experience (working with him). We became good friends, he was a misunderstood man. He was a great actor, the first superstar. But he had a habit of coming late on the set, and many directors and producers would have a problem with that. But this is a business, when you have a superstar, the film is driven by his name and negotiations happen. They’d crib about him not reaching on time but once he’d reach, they would greet him warmly and ask him ‘ab lunch karenge ya shooting karenge (would you like to have lunch first or start shooting now)?’, and he’d say, ‘No, let’s shoot.’ His specialty was that he completed his work every day before leaving, and he would do it brilliantly.”

"Bobby Deol calls his murderous rapist character in Animal a ‘romantic’, says Ranbir Kapoor didn’t know whom to sympathise with","Bobby Deol said that the character he portrayed in Animal is a reflection of society. He expressed that one can't help but feel empathy for the character, despite his villainous behaviour.","Actor Bobby Deol is currently enjoying the success of his recent movie Animal, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga. Despite having only 15 minutes of screen time in the lengthy 3.5-hour film, Bobby, who played the brutal villain Abrar, has won over the audience. In an interview, he said that he doesn’t judge his characters, and said that he played Abrar as if he was the hero of his own story, ready to do anything for his family. Bobby also shared that both he and Ranbir Kapoor were unsure about whom to sympathise with in the film.
In an interview with Zoom Entertainment, Bobby said, “I didn’t look at myself as a villain in the film because Abrar loses his grandfather in front of his eyes, who burns himself, and that shock takes away his voice. So, he swears that he’ll avenge his grandfather’s death, and he’s a very family-oriented man. He’s romantic; he has three wives and would kill for his family. So, that was the thought that was there in my mind while playing it. That’s why when you see the character, you feel for the character, even though he’s supposed to be the antagonist. And I think when we were shooting the fight sequence, even Ranbir said that to me, ‘We don’t know who to sympathise with.'”

"Vetrimaaran reveals he overshot Viduthalai budget by more than Rs 60 cr, crew member died on set: ‘I had no clue what I was going to shoot…’","Director Vetrimaaran recently discussed Viduthalai Part 1, and revealed that his lack of preparation caused the budget to escalate from Rs 4.5 crore to Rs 65 crore, and for Vijay Sethupathi to spend 70 days instead of the originally planned eight.","Since it marked his first feature directorial venture after four years, Vetrimaaran’s Viduthalai Part 1 generated significant hype well before its release. Adding to the excitement was the fact that Soori, primarily known for comedic roles, was chosen as the lead of this period crime thriller, with Vijay Sethupathi also portraying a key character.
However, the film’s production faced unexpected challenges, and director Vetrimaaran recently shared insights into his chaotic process at the Film Companion director’s roundtable, leaving many of his contemporaries such as Karan Johar and Nelson Dilipkumar flabbergasted. Recalling his initial commitment to complete the project in 35 days, akin to his previous work Visaranai (2016), Vetrimaaran said that upon visiting the locations, he realised he could only accomplish 10 per cent of the film in 20 days. He reflected, “By then, we had already exhausted 70 per cent of the budget. The hill we chose for filming prohibited vehicle access, necessitating the manual transport of all equipment. Atop the hill, we set up tents for 250 people and installed 10-12 toilets for the villagers, so that we could also use them. One day, a severe storm arrived and dismantled all our tents. Upon returning to the ground, I came to the realisation that I can’t complete this project.”

Karan Johar says Zoya Akhtar gave him a lecture on why stalking is wrong: ‘Then you have someone like Sandeep Reddy Vanga…’,Karan Johar said that he has now evolved as a filmmaker and understands that stalking isn't love.,"Filmmaker Karan Johar has opened up about his creative process, and personal evolution as a director. Karan admitted to making mistakes in his earlier movies, and explained how his views on intense romance have changed over time. What he once thought was passion, he later learned was no different from stalking. The filmmaker also revealed the advice given by fellow filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. 
In an interview with Film Companion, Karan said, “I never viewed Rocky Aur Rani as a love story; I saw it as my homage to Hindi cinema. What I aimed to do was bring in a commentary on things I strongly believe in. I grew up dancing to Indian music on my own and being mocked by my friends. Moreover, I grew up understanding that people can have love stories that are brushed under the carpet because I’ve known it in my own family.”

He also recalled the moment Ranbir Kapoor realised that he was playing Karan in the film, and what happened next. A the the Film Companion’s directors’ round-table, Karan shared that Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was inspired by his own heartbreak. He shared, “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil arrived as a love story which was my story. That was my story because I, in those six years, fell in love with somebody that was not mine and I understood what one-sided love is.”
He continued, “Then I realised that there is a creature called unrequited love that is heartbreaking it can shatter you to pieces to smithereens actually, and there’s a physical pain. When we say heartache, it is not symbolic, it is true, it hurts and it hurts like hell. You feel like literally the earth has slipped by you, and you don’t know what to do. Making that film, that was the most cathartic journey I’ve had with the film.”

Chiranjeevi, who started his career in Telugu movies in 1978, once shared that he gained the confidence of becoming an actor only because he was saw Shatrughan on screen.

Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies is peppy and political; it’s Rang De Basanti set to Christmas carols,"The Archies kids are the Anglo-Indian milkshake-sipping revolutionary ancestors of Rang De Basanti's Delhi-based alu paratha-eating mundas. They party, fall apart and come together -- to save their idea of India.","Frustrated with spineless media, corporate takeover and journalists on payroll, angered citizens hit the streets to oppose a resolution passed by the local council that can destroy carefully nurtured shared history. It could be the India of today, but it’s also the past of a fictional town of Zoya Akhtar’s latest musical The Archies— the new Netflix feature that offers Christmas candies wrapped in a pamphlet of young rebellion.
Also Read | The Archies movie review: Suhana Khan grows on you, Khushi Kapoor packs verve
The publicity campaign of The Archies was fueled with intense—at least back when it was announced—criticism of casting three privileged star kids out of the seven young debutants. It marks the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana, megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson Agastya and actor Sridevi and film producer Boney Kapoor’s daughter Khushi. The narrative aligned with the years of unfair labeling of Akhtar as a maker interested only in chronicling stories of the rich. Having star kids in the ensemble only added a dash of a smug of course.

"‘Earlier, stars were launched. Now if an actor does two good scenes, he will get better opportunities’","At a recent Adda held in Delhi, actor Vicky Kaushal and filmmaker Meghna Gulzar spoke on the making of their film on Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, what defines stardom and writing with nuance","On whether it’s possible to be a star and remain authentic
Gulzar: Whether it’s possible or not I don’t know, but it should be prescribed because I think the audience sniffs artificiality and that comes in the way. My mother was a star in her own right at a time when there was no social media. So that was just pure and raw stardom. I think stardom is also different things to different people. For him (Vicky), I think, it is getting the adulation and the approval of his audience for his work more than the trappings that stardom is known for. This is a very personal interpretation of what stardom is or should be, but I don’t see his lacking or wanting in any way.
On his breakout role in Masaan
Kaushal: At that time, I was just a boy looking for opportunities, a very hungry and stubborn boy. I auditioned for Masaan (2015) and got selected. Apart from Richa Chadha and Sanjay Mishraji, it was everybody’s first film. So it was made with a lot of purity. It was a lot of novices coming together with a lot of passion for that breakout opportunity. I went to Banaras about three weeks before we started shooting and tried to just be one with the place. Apart from learning the language, the culture, about the Dom community (that cremates bodies), I had an audio track which was just ‘Ram Naam Satya Hai’. I used to put that on my headphones and would try to sleep to that music. At first, it used to be very haunting but I tried it because for the boy Deepak (the character he plays, who belongs to the Dom community) it must have been his lullaby. He has lived there only. I spent a lot of time at the cremation ground. I remember the first time I went there, I couldn’t sit there for 15 minutes but eventually I was able to spend days over there, was able to have a cup of tea right next to a burning pyre and say ‘shakkar kam hai’ (the sugar is less). So it was just surrendering to that whole world.

Kastoori movie review: A reality check about caste and class,Kastoori movie review: Director Vinod Kamble does not point the finger at casteism and class discrimination overtly. But their impact in creating social barriers and inequalities is evident.,"What’s striking about Kastoori is the underlying dreaminess. Even though the movie takes an unpretentious and unflinching look at an underprivileged school-going boy’s struggle to continue his education, the movie rarely shows him giving up hope. This dreaminess is at times expressed through the soothing background score but mostly through the undying optimism and smiles of Gopi (Samarth Sonawane).
Gopi is engaged in manual scavenging, cleaning toilets, and assisting in performing autopsies while his father spends most of his time at a local bar. In spite of being a bright student, Gopi is forced to choose between education and work since he has to contribute to his family’s income. With the help of soap and attar, Gopi tries to get rid of the smell that he fears he carries after all the scavenging and cleaning work. Gopi, prodded by his best friend (Shravan Upalakar), dreams of kastoori (musk) that will take away the odoriferous proof of his harsh life as well as class.

How Ranbir Kapoor got a pot-belly in Animal? Viral video shows the process. Watch here,"A viral video shows Ranbir Kapoor sweating it out in the gym to get the chiselled chest and six-pack abs for Animal, while he uses prosthetics to showcase his character ageing.","Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s latest film Animal is drawing all kinds of attention — good, bad and ugly from the audience.

Wonka movie review: Hugh Grant is the sugar rush in this uncomplicated Timothee Chalamet film,"Wonka movie review: Given the waves of blood and bodies coming at us from the big screen these days, Wonka is in a lot of ways a relief – and a sign that Hollywood is marking a change of season to Christmas.","Forget Gene Wilder, forget Johnny Depp, in fact forget Willy Wonka too for a moment. Think Charlie. For, this is what the latest iteration of the Roald Dahl classic essentially is. Chalamet is so sweet and uncomplicated – more a lump of sugar than a bean of cocoa – that his Willy could pass off for the innocent Charlie (without the need for a lifetime of chocolate supply, as he can whip them up on demand).
There are no daddy issues, only fond mama memories – and few mamas evoke as much fondness as Sally Hawkins (she appears briefly). There are two Dickensian characters exploiting an orphan (among other people), three big chocolate businessmen running a cartel, one corruptible police chief, and one pliable priest. However, nothing terribly bad happens in this Warner Brothers film – unless you count being almost drowned in gallons of melted chocolate.

"Extra Ordinary Man movie review: Nithiin-starrer is a silly, outdated film","Extra Ordinary Man movie review: Vakkantham Vamshi’s writing is poor, illogical and hardly entertains. His direction is equally lacklustre.","Actor Nithiin, who is struggling with four back-to-back flops, and writer-director Vakkantham Vamshi, who helmed the critically acclaimed Naa Peru Surya and wrote the super flop Agent earlier this year, are uniting for Extra Ordinary Man. This is Vamshi’s second directorial. The makers have openly declared that the film is going to be a routine commercial fare, albeit with a fresh approach. Casting actor Rajasekhar in an important role is definitely refreshing. Let’s move on to what else worked in the movie, or not.
Abhinav (Nithiin) is a background actor who is always looking for that big break. After lots of waiting and taunts from his father to find better employment, he finally decides to leave cinema to work for Likhitha (Sreeleela), hoping to win her love also in the process.

"Sharmila Tagore: Satyajit Ray’s rare find was dismissed from school for being ‘bad influence’, defied threats of bullets to marry outside her faith","Born on December 8, 1944, veteran actor Sharmila Tagore grew up in a joint family of creative minds and achievers. Today, on her birthday, we revisit how her upbringing shaped her into the person she is today.","“She was younger…but something about the young girl’s eyes told me not to reject her.”
Satyajit Ray couldn’t resist Sharmila Tagore’s eyes when she was just 13 — they asked a lot of questions, and often daydreamed back in 1959. To some, they are reminiscent of ‘Ye chaand sa roshan chehra, zulfon ka rang sunehra, ye jheel se neeli aankhein, koi raaz hai inme gehra’. To others, they still exude the elegance and innocence of Apu’s child bride Aparna (Satyajit Ray’s Apur Sansar). But what remains common is adulation among cinephiles for this beauty-with-brains who defied the Hindi film industry’s and society’s unwritten rules by choice, not necessity.

In an interview, Mansi denied that any sort of assault happened in the scene, but admitted that the ‘twisted’ Abrar was ‘filled with animal instincts’ in that scene, which prompted him to vent his frustrations on his wives.
Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor, Animal has come under fire for its depiction of toxic masculinity and misogyny. Despite this, the film has emerged as a major hit, having grossed around Rs 550 crore at the worldwide box office. Vanga basically went through a similar cycle with his previous film, Kabir Singh.

Animal actor Siddhant Karnick opens up about scene where he flings burning cigarette at wife: ‘Can get tempting to go dark’,Animal actor Siddhant Karnick spoke about the scene where he throws a burning cigarette towards his on-screen wife.,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s film Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, is in the theatres and it has turned out to be the most divisive film of the year. The film is being seen as misogynistic and triggering by a section of the audience and actor Siddhant Karnick, who played the role of Ranbir’s brother-in-law in the film, recently opened up about performing one such scene in the film. Sidhhant plays Varun, the husband of Ranbir’s sister Reet, played by Saloni Batra. In one of the scenes, his character flings a burning cigarette towards his wife and Siddhant shared that it is important to separate reel from the real so the effect of such characters doesn’t impact his own life.
Talking to Filme Shilmy about this scene, Siddhant said, “This is where the training comes in. You switch on, you switch off. You don’t bring that psyche back home. You don’t bring that into your personal life with your friends and family. That’s when actors go psychotic.” Siddhant added that it is “tempting” to “go dark” and shared, “As professionals, it can get very tempting to go dark. As someone who comes from the outside, where do I not have that many opportunities, any opportunity I get, I want to make the most of it.”

"Hi Nanna box office collection day 1: Nani and Mrunal Thakur’s Telugu drama starts on a high note, earns Rs 6.10 crore","Hi Nanna box office collection day 1: Nani and Mrunal Thakur film earned Rs 6.10 crore on the opening day, on the back of largely positive reviews.","Telugu star Nani and Mrunal Thakur‘s romantic drama, Hi Nanna, has received largely positive reviews and is bringing audiences to theatres. The film, directed by Shouryuv, has performed well on its opening day and according to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film eared Rs 6.10 crore on Thursday, the day of its release.
Hi Nanna was initially scheduled for a worldwide theatrical release on December 21, however, the makers brought forward its release date to December 7 to avoid clashing with Prabhas’ epic action thriller film Salaar, directed by KGF fame Prastanth Neel. The decision seems to have proved to be a wise move as no other major Telugu films have released this week and the film will enjoy a free run at the box office, extending into next week also.

Toxic: Rocking Star Yash’s KGF follow-up is a ‘fairy-tale for grown-ups’; watch announcement video here,"The title for 'Rocking Star' Yash's new film has been unveiled. Directed by Geetu Mohandas, the film has been titled Toxic.","‘Rocking Star’ Yash has finally announced his follow-up to KGF: Chapter 2. The Kannada star will headline director Geetu Mohandas‘ Toxic, described in a recently released video as ‘a fairy-tale for grown-ups’. The short video doesn’t reveal any footage from the movie, nor does it give an idea of what the film’s plot will be, but through a series of animated visuals, it gives a sense of the tone.
We see shots of Joker cards, explosions, and a quick glimpse of a man wearing a hat, smoking a cigar, and brandishing what looks like a Tommy gun. Is Toxic a period gangster movie? Or is it an anti-hero crime thriller in the vein of Todd Phillips’ Joker movie. It looks like the movie will continue the blockbuster trend of major movie stars playing violent men, following in the footsteps of Kamal Haasan’s Vikram, Vijay’s Leo, and most recently, Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal.

"‘Animal made my daughter cry, is disrespectful to Sikh sentiments’: Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan in Rajya Sabha",Chhattisgarh Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan complained about the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal in Rajya Sabha.,"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal has been divisive film; on the one hand, it is making a killing at the box office, but on the other, it’s drawing criticism for its glorification of toxic masculinity. Now, the controversy has reached the floor of the Rajya Sabha, with Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan telling Parliament that her daughter broke down in tears after watching the crime epic.
She said according to AajTak, “Cinema is a mirror of society. We have grown up watching cinema, and it can influence the youth. First, there were films like Kabir Singh and Pushpa, and now there is Animal. My daughter went to watch the film with her college friends, and walked out midway through because she couldn’t stop crying.”

In an interview, Anurag looked back on his collaboration with Ranbir on the critical and commercial disappointment Bombay Velvet, and explained why it wouldn’t be a good idea to work with a major star again.
Ranbir’s career has attained new heights since Bombay Velvet, thanks to blockbusters such as Sanju, and more recently, Animal. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Animal has made nearly Rs 550 crore worldwide in about a week of release, and is expected to set new box office records for Hindi cinema. Anurag told Pinkvilla that his commercial sensibilities aren’t that strong. “Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are the finest actors. And they’re a couple. Imagine the amount of talent in one house. If (Animal) is successful for him, it’s good for him,” he said.

"How Naeem Sayyed became Junior Mehmood: ‘Mehmood picked me up in his arms, told my father that I will take care of him’",Junior Mehmood passed away on Friday at the age of 67. The late actor got his name from comedy star Mehmood.,"Veteran actor Naeem Sayyed, who was popularly known as Junior Mehmood, passed away in Mumbai on Friday at the age of 67. The actor gained fame when he started working as a child artist and became popular as Junior Mehmood after the senior actor took him under his wing. Mehmood was one of the most popular comedians of that time and he accepted Naeem as his disciple after they worked together in the 1968 film Suhaag Raat.
Junior Mehmood  spoke about his relationship with the veteran actor, whom he addressed as ‘Bhaijaan’ in an earlier interview with Amar Ujala and said that he first visited Mehmood’s house as a guest on his daughter’s first birthday. “I got a chance to work with Mehmood in the film Suhaag Raat as his brother-in-law. We became quite friendly during the shoot of that film. It was his daughter’s first birthday when he invited the entire unit to his house and I also went,” he shared.

Mast Mein Rehne Ka movie review: Jackie Shroff and Neena Gupta film restores faith in humanity,"Mast Mein Rehne Ka movie review: This contemporary Mumbai fable, with impressive Jackie Shroff and Neena Gupta at its heart, has optimism as it's guiding principle.","Designed as a contemporary Mumbai fable, Mast Mein Rehne Ka makes you believe the cup is half-full even when things go horribly awry. With such optimism as its guiding principle, the movie follows the lives of a bunch of characters who are struggling to lead a better life in the metropolis. Stories of hope and resilience set in the densely populated Mumbai are not new for movie-lovers. But the film shifts its focus to the loneliness of the elderly to offer a fresh take about the city’s aloofness as well as generosity.
At the beginning of the movie, we meet widower Kamath (Jackie Shroff) trying to lead a disciplined life. By the end of the day, however, gnawing loneliness takes over, making him almost give up on life until he comes across another lonely soul in the city, Prakash Kaur Handa (Nina Gupta). Unlike surly Kamath, Prakash is spirited. She is happy-go-lucky, makes inappropriate jokes and uses expletives.

When Pa Ranjith used ‘Superstar’ Rajinikanth to undercut the image of a hero,"In this age of Indian cinema, where heroes have once again become demigods, Pa Ranjith used Rajinikanth, the poster boy of superstardom, to put ideology before idol.","“Kya re? Setting-ah? Vengaiyan mavan othaila nikken. Dhillrundha mothama vaangalae (What is it guys? All set, is it? Vengaiyan’s son is here standing all alone. Bring it on, if you all have it in you),” proclaimed Rajinikanth in the teaser of Kaala five years ago that sent the whole of Tamil Nadu into a frenzy. The scene quickly became the much-anticipated part of the film as everyone wanted to know what would ensue after the heroic scream of Superstar Rajinikanth. And… it turned out to be a damp squib in the movie as the scene ended up in an anti-climax. As the rowdies close in, Kaala’s (Rajinikanth) elder son swoops in and what could have been an epic fight sequence settles down with no fizz. The whole set-up was an easy way to get the audience going. It is a no-brainer. Had it been directed by any other filmmaker, it would have become a perfect battlefield that would have left Rajinikanth fans in euphoria. On top of that, Pa Ranjith had Santhosh Narayanan’s raging “Katravai Patravai” at his disposal. Why then did Ranjith refuse to pull the trigger? Perhaps, the director is a pleasure-delayer because we get all that high later in the ‘Rain fight’, which ends up becoming the interval block. On top of it, it is Ranjith’s way of saying he is not going to play it for the gallery. It is his way of saying it is not about the Vengaiyan Mavan but the film.
When Kaala was released, a predominant narrative about the film was that it was neither Rajinikanth’s film nor Pa Ranjith’s. The heroism or the so-called ‘mass moments’ were nuanced for the fans who have seen their Thalaivar stop bullets with his gaze. On the other hand, the critics of the director claimed he has ‘compromised’ his values to accommodate the superstar. While both criticisms hold water to an extent, in retrospect, Kaala remains predominantly a vision of Ranjith more than a star vehicle. One has to only compare the film with the subsequent Rajinikanth ventures to understand how different Kaala is from the likes of Jailer or Annaatthe. The comparison is not to put down masala cinema, but to bring out the difference between them and Kaala.

Dharmendra stitched new suits every year in anticipation of an award; gave up and decided to go in underwear if he ever got one,"Dharmendra, who is celebrating his 88th birthday today, had previously opened up multiple times about why he was never given the 'Best Actor' award, despite his constant hardwork.","With a career as timeless as the golden era of Bollywood, Dharmendra has etched his journey in the reel of our hearts and the legendary actor is celebrating his birthday today.  His journey speaks volumes of an era where the ‘He-Man’ of Bollywood took center stage. The actor’s journey began in 1960 when Arjun Hingorani signed him for Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere as the lead, marking his debut as a hero for a meager Rs 51. Widely known as ‘Garam Dharam,’ Dharmendra became a busy star by the late 60s. 
With over 300 films to his name, including hits like Phool Aur Patthar, Sholay, Pratigya, Mera Gaon Mera Desh, and Chupke Chupke, he left an everlasting mark on the industry. Despite his prolific career, Dharmendra received only one Filmfare award early in his career for Best Talent, followed by a lifetime achievement award towards the end.

The Archies: Zoya Akhtar’s politically-charged film will be triggering for the Animal army,"Post Credits Scene: Director Zoya Akhtar's charming teen romance movie is actually a politically-charged call-to-arms, weaponising nostalgia not only as a superficial tool, but to remind an entire generation of boomers of what they used to be.","“Children don’t count,” spits a man who has clearly forgotten that he used to be a child himself. This man is Mr Dawson, a middle-aged politician who has been sweet-talked into corruption by a big businessman named Hiram Lodge. He’s the one effectively running things, while elected officials like Dawson serve as glorified stooges under his iron fist. Sounds familiar? In her new film, The Archies, director Zoya Akhtar disguises her political angst by unleashing a charm-offensive as irresistible as that memorable piece to camera in Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan.
Set in a semi-fantastical hill station in 1964, The Archies isn’t merely a superficial nostalgia trip (although Gold Spot and Bata make cameo appearances in several scenes). The movie’s bigger achievement is reminding a certain generation — the boomers, or, as we like to call them, the uncles — that before spending their afternoons fighting over parking spots and voting right-wing governments into power, they actually cared — about the environment, about free speech, about democracy. In its own good-natured way, The Archies is something that only Javed Akhtar’s daughter could’ve made, but more to the point, it’s a movie that will likely be about as triggering to fans of Animal as Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s blockbuster has been to his detractors.

Ram Gopal Varma on critics calling Animal a violent and misogynistic film: ‘I find it funny’,Ram Gopal Varma discussed various aspects of Ranbir Kapoor's Animal. The filmmaker recently lauded the film in his review that he shared on social media.,"Ram Gopal Varma has been praising Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal ever since the film released in theatres. Recently, the Satya director shared his review of the film on X. RGV even went on to say that he would like to touch filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Ranbir’s feet for making the movie. Now, in an interview, Varma opened up on different aspects of the film, what he liked and disliked, and critics panning it for glorifying toxic masculinity.
Speaking on how critics are calling out Animal for being a violent and misogynistic film, RGV told Connect FM Canada, “That’s the nature of a violent film and the director has been saying that from the beginning. ‘You will see what violence is,’ he had said. So you are pre-warned even in trailer and interviews. And then to call it violent, I find it funny. See the whole point of a film is to startle you and to provoke an emotion. Shock is one of the emotions. Many times I was surprised in the film, but it can be an unpleasant surprise to some people and when sudden shock comes, it disorients them.”

Joram movie review: Manoj Bajpayee is effective in grim survival tale,"Joram movie review: Manoj Bajpayee is effective, needless to say, but is given a limited register of despair and terror.","Devashish Makhija makes movies about people on the margins, compelled to switch on their survival mode in the face of great odds. His fourth feature ‘Joram’ reunites him with Manoj Bajpayee who was terrific as a retired low-level policeman in ‘Bhonsle’: here, the latter plays a tribal on the run, keeping at bay inimical forces from within his own people, as well as those who are hunting him from the outside. Is there anyone left on his side?
Dasru Kerketta (Bajpayee) and Vaano (Chatterjee) are forced to leave behind an idyllic life in their Jharkhand village, and move to a concrete construction in Mumbai. A violent killing, in which Dasru is made to participate, is the catalyst for their flight.

The Doordarshan show was extremely popular at the time and made Aanjjan a household name. He recalled, “He was offered a small role in Wagle Ki Duniya. He jumped on the offer and said I’ll do it, just tell me what to do.” Aanjjan recalled that he initially wanted another actor for the part but when he worked with SRK, he was in awe of his talent. “He was not a star at the time and he had such sportsman spirit,” he said.

While Javed wrote the lyrics of the album, the Hindi dialogues of the film came from Farhan.
Speaking about working with her brother, Zoya told News18, “The Hindi dialogues came from Farhan. He took a blueprint and made it into his syntax and the syntax of that particular language and the simplicity of the Archie comics. Getting the corniness and humour of the comics was tough but he brought that out really well. He was the one who introduced the phrase ‘Va Va Voom’ from the comics into the song.”

"The Archies movie review: Suhana Khan, Khushi Kapoor, Agastya Nanda film is a bland bauble","'The Archies movie review: Khushi Kapoor has more verve than both Agastya Nanda and Suhana Khan, but the latter does grow on you. The film's writing, however, is less than perky.","In Riverdale, a small sylvan Indian town with a large Anglo-Indian community, everyone knows everyone. It is 1964, a time of innocence, a time of confidences. Clean-faced teenagers flit about doing teenager stuff, strumming guitars in the high-school band, making eyes and flirting and dating — the good-looking Archie Andrews, the pretty Betty Cooper, the sassy Veronica Lodge, the always-hungry Jughead Jones, the cocky Reggie Mantle, the likeable but dull Moose, the sensible Ethel — as the adults, including the beloved Pop Tate who runs the cafeteria with its big burgers and tall shakes, go about their business.
This brand new Netflix iteration of the Archie comics, which began printing in the US in 1941, and held such sway in select urban Indian pockets in the 70s and 80s, was always going to be judged on one count. Will this fresh cast, headlined by Agastya Nanda as Archie, Khushi Kapoor as Betty, and Suhana Khan as Veronica, will be able to pull off those madly popular characters?
For the virulent anti-Bollywood gang, this trio is nothing but Nepotism Central. I am here to say that these kids aren’t terrible. If I had to choose, I’d say Khushi has more verve than both Agastya and Suhana, but I will also say that the latter did grow on me: she has her father’s dimple, and she did manage the arched eyebrow, haughty-miss expression a few times.
ADVERTISEMENT
And the others are just fine, especially the bright-as-a-tack Dilton (Yuvraj Menda) who represents the kind of boy who likes other boys, Mihir Ahuja as Archie’s loyal pal Juggie, and Vedang Raina as the too-smart-by-half Reggie. I also liked that none of the kids is singled out for special treatment; they all get to share screen space equitably.
As readers who devoured these comics so high on all-American values, we know that it is easy-paced nostalgia of that era that Zoya Akhtar is going for, and the film does get in some of that feeling it its choice of apparel and hair-styles: skirts and pixie bob-cuts and high-waisted pants. And coming-of-age stories never get old: remember how we scoffed at the ‘high-school’ that Karan Johar’s self-confessed Archies-Riverdale prototype created in his ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’, and yet fell for the mix, because who could resist the high-wattage charm of SRK as Archie, Kajol as Betty and Rani as Veronica even though they looked way older than teenagers, and even though they were horribly politically incorrect even at the time?
The other thing that the film gets right is in the way it looks, which isn’t a surprise coming from Zoya Akhtar, Reema Kagti and co, whose production values are always top-notch. The lavish Lodge residence, in which Aly Khan plays the big businessman with an eye on the green lung of Riverdale, the sprawling, leafy Green Park, the restful book-shop, the newspaper office, the hair-dressers, are all spot on. The tricky balance between the comic-book aspect, and the real-life feel is right.

But what isn’t, is the film itself. Only a couple of songs stand out: the opening one has real lilt. The plot does give us a sense of the world at the time — a sit-in at the beloved Green Park which the townspeople are trying to save from greedy capitalists foreshadows the Woodstock protest, the local newspaper stands up for the right of free expression, same-sex love is hinted at, and a song goes ‘Everything Is Political’ — but overall, the writing isn’t perky enough.
The kids are all right. The film is a bland bauble.

Looks like Naga Chaitanya is playing a fisherman in the film, which is directed by Chandoo Mondeti, known for his hit films Karthikeya and Karthikeya 2. This marks his third collaboration with the actor. The two have earlier worked together in the Telugu remake of the hit Malayalam film Premam and Savyaasachi. Both their previous collaborations have only yielded mediocre results.
The film is also an important one in Naga Chaitanya’s career as he has not delivered a hit in the past few years. His last film Custody, which raised expectations, turned out to be another flop in his career.
Other than Naga Chaitanya, the film also has Sai Pallavi in the lead role. Devi Sri Prasad is composing music for the film, which is produced by Allu Aravind’s Geetha Arts.

"Netflix abandoned Vikramaditya Motwane’s Indira Gandhi documentary, Anurag Kashyap’s magnum opus after Tandav controversy","Coincidentally, all three directors - Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee and Vikramaditya Motwane - were instrumental in introducing Netflix to Indian audiences.","When Warner Bros announced that it wasn’t going to release the completed Batgirl film and was instead going cut losses with a tax write-off, the move was described as unprecedented. The studio had already spent nearly $100 million on the superhero movie. WB did the same thing again recently with the Coyote vs Acme film, and this time, the industry didn’t stay quiet. Faced with growing pressure, the studio allowed the filmmakers to shop Coyote vs Acme around to other interested distributors, instead of letting it sit on a shelf. But decision-making like this has been common in the Indian streaming industry, the Washington Post recently reported.
Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Prime Video ask for extensive changes to be made to stories involving politics, caste, and religion, when they aren’t ‘politely passing’ on the projects altogether. “Why greenlight it, then change your mind?” asked Anurag Kashyap, whose magnum opus three-part adaptation of Suketu Mehta’s Maximum City was abandoned by Netflix, sending him into a depressive spiral.

But even though that didn’t happen, the action-thriller is playing like a South tent-pole at the box office, only in the north. Tiger 3 is proving to be quite front-loaded, and like so many major Tamil hits, it’s running out of steam in less than two weeks of release. On day 10 in theatres, Tiger 3 added Rs 6.3 crore to its domestic total, according to industry tracker Sacnilk.
The action-thriller has now made Rs 243 crore in India, and will cross the Rs 250 crore mark either today or tomorrow. While this is a significant feat, especially for Salman, who hasn’t delivered an outright hit since 2017’s Tiger Zinda Hai, the film’s bloated budget must be taken into account. Tiger 3 reportedly cost Rs 300 crore to produce, and will be lucky to pass the Rs 500 crore mark globally by the end of its theatrical run. The movie’s current global gross recently passed the Rs 400 crore mark, according to analyst Manobala Vijayabalan.

The unintended similarities between Bobby Deol’s Soldier and Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan: How much has Hindi cinema really changed?,"As Bobby Deol's Soldier turns 25 this week, we draw parallels between the film and Shah Rukh Khan's recent blockbuster Jawan and ask the pressing question: Is Hindi cinema truly progressing or circling back to familiar tropes?","I was looking for a subtle way to say this, but since the recent action thrillers in the Hindi cinema have been anything but subtle, I will put it plainly: Jawan gave me a headache. Too harsh? Hear me out. Jawan paraded a familiar narrative: a villain named Kalee (Vijay Sethupathi), a global arms dealer, a son (Azad, played by Shah Rukh Khan) seeking retribution for his supposedly deceased father (Vikram Rathore, also portrayed by SRK), unjustly branded a traitor to the nation. Meanwhile, the son’s grieving mother (Deepika Padukone) faces society’s harsh judgment. This film was a concoction of patriotism and on-the-nose messaging, essentially wrapping an outdated ’90s storyline in the sheen of modernity —high-tech slow-motion shots, sleek cinematography, and sophisticated graphics — served up for the 2023 audience.
Don’t believe me? I recently got a chance to watch Bobby Deol’s Soldier, the 1998 action thriller, that reminded me a lot of Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this week, Soldier features Bobby Deol as Vicky, the son of a deceased Army officer, embarking on a vendetta to avenge his father, falsely accused of treachery. His ostracised mother seeks solace in a temple, shunned by society. The film’s antagonists are responsible for slandering Vicky’s father, in the same way that Kalee besmirched Azad’s father, Vikram Rathore, in Jawan.

On Saroj Khan's birth anniversary, here's revisiting her contribution to Indian cinema.","Choreographer Saroj Khan’s illustrious career as a dance guru in Bollywood redefined dancing in Hindi films. Several of the leading actresses such as Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai and Sridevi did some of their most memorable songs with her. Saroj, who passed away in 2020, has composed dance moves in a plethora of films and one such memorable track was “Dhak Dhak” from the film Beta. The song was choreographed on Anil Kapoor and Madhuri, which also gave the latter the title of ‘Dhak Dhak girl’. However, not many know that Central Board of Film Certification wanted to chop down scenes from the song, as they deemed the dance steps to be deliberately provocative and not appropriate for audience back then.
In a documentary, The Saroj Khan Story made by The Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT) in 2012, the choreographer explained the conversation she had with CBFC members. She explained that the board members had problem with the dance steps, and especially a scene where Madhuri is seen sitting down.

"Scott Pilgrim Takes Off review: Netflix’s radical retelling of cult classic is an Eternal Sunshine-level event, and one of the best shows of 2023","Scott Pilgrim Takes Off review: Brilliantly animated with an ambitious story to boot, Netflix's anime retelling of the cult classic film deviates from the source material in creative ways.","In the decade-and-change since Bryan Lee O’Malley’s landmark Scott Pilgrim comic book series ended its run, the notion of Manic Pixie Dream Girls skating into the lives of layabout young men and igniting a spark inside the depths of their disillusioned souls has become obsolete. Some would say correctly. A live-action film adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright and released in 2010, perfectly captured this millennial malaise, retaining the comic book’s irreverent humour and, in a great example of the Mandela Effect, giving the impression that it was painted in the most vivid colours imaginable — it was actually in black and white.
Over a decade after the film earned cult status after crumbling at the box office, Netflix has unveiled an eight-episode anime series with O’Malley at the helm alongside BenDavid Grabinski. Nothing — not the marketing material, the disarmingly familiar opening episode, even the much-publicised decision to get each cast member from the live-action movie to return — can prepare you for the sheer burst of originality that you’re in for, especially if you’ve been a fan of the series. Scott Pilgrim Takes Off isn’t a remake; it isn’t even a reboot or a re-quel. It takes the same premise — a slacker from Toronto somehow ‘pataos’ a girl who’s clearly out of his league — and branches off into a different realm altogether.

“This is a film based on the Indian freedom struggle, but it is a timeless story. The current generation should take inspiration from this. The freedom struggle ended in 1947 but even after that, as a woman, child, and actor everyone struggles. We should find inspiration within ourselves,” Sara Ali Khan told reporters on the sidelines of IFFI.
As a history student, the actor said, the film turned out to be an interesting opportunity. The movie is written by Darab Farooqui and Kannan Iyer.

“I am a history student. Also, time travel won’t be possible so how will I go to the Quit India Movement and relive those emotions that people faced at that point of time… I have got this chance by doing this movie,” she said.
The makers today also conducted a session on “Drawing inspiration from history to create an immersive cinematic experience for today’s audiences”.

Iyer said while the team has taken creative liberties to make the story engaging, they have remained true to the essence of actual events that took place during the Quit India Movement of 1942.
“I would like to share that Sara has been so open to every nuance of the character she plays. She is a modern young woman, who transformed into the part so seamlessly. I would like to thank her for being on this journey with me,” he added.
Karan Johar said, “Ae Watan Mere Watan is an inspiring story that needed to be told. We have tried to tell some stories, inspired by true events that have spoken volumes about the love for our country, and this film is that. We are very excited to be here at IFFI, for the audience to catch a glimpse of this film that will be premiering next year.”
The film will premiere on Prime Video in India and other global territories.

I said, ‘Please Harris we can go musically in a lot of places.’ He has made a whole fight sequence with a song. He also put out a word about the film which has also helped it.

He continued shooting until 7 in the evening. Even during a 10-minute break between shots for lighting changes, he wouldn’t sit down; he kept rehearsing.

While speaking to Film Companion, Kartik revealed, “I was not a producer-producer as such. I was given that credit on the basis that the film was going into a money crisis, and I gave up on my fees. I also gave some money so that the structure could be made and the film doesn’t get stuck.” He added that he was ‘just acting as a producer’, and said, “The producers were gracious enough that they credited me (as a producer) for that reason.” Going forward, Kartik has no plans to produce a film and is only focused on his acting career.

The ban was lifted after three years.,"No conversation about cricket in the country can happen without the mention of Mumbai’s iconic Wankhede stadium, and every mention of the stadium is incomplete without invoking the infamous fight that broke out there involving superstar Shah Rukh Khan.

My kids were there and I thought someone… Maybe they had a rule, that hatao yaha se. I told him, these are our kids and we are taking them. I just said this. There was a person there who said a word which I, as a Delhi person, felt like it was an abusive word. Even though the same word in Marathi is also rude. Thoda sa religious, galat tha woh (It was religious, it was wrong). I then lost my cool, main pagal hogaya and I went to hit him,” the superstar recalled.

Farrey movie review: Alizeh Agnihotri leads a near-perfect cast in this teenage drama that scores high,Farrey movie review: Salman Khan's niece Alizeh Agnihotri makes a confident debut in this film about teenagers masterminding cheating during exams.,"Farrey (which means ‘chit’) is a refreshing change from the many typical high-school dramas, which are currently flooding streaming services, and often pack in-your-face violence, sex and substance abuse. The movie, an official adaptation of Thai writer-director Nattawut Poonpriya’s acclaimed ‘Bad Genius’, instead throws the spotlight on its academically brilliant protagonist who is drawn into a web of manipulation and greed, before she picks up the art of hustling herself.
The movie introduces debutant Alizeh Agnihotri (Salman Khan’s niece), who may not exude the flamboyance of her star uncle but confidently essays the role of an exceptionally bright teenager who finds herself in a bind. Agnihotri plays the role of the ‘bad genius’ Niyati, who has been brought up in an orphanage by its warden and his wife. After becoming the state topper, Niyati ends up bagging a coveted scholarship that helps her secure a place at a prestigious international school. Her impressive score notwithstanding, Niyati is a misfit in the elite setup where students are driven around in luxury cars. But this genius is blessed with street-smartness and is quick to adapt to its ways.
What starts as an innocuous act of helping a classmate for Niyati, soon grows into a cheating racket during examinations. As more rich students get involved in it, the orphanage starts getting more donations and Niyati has money for her expenses. Soon, another bright but poor student Aakash, who had also bagged the scholarship, is drawn into this racket in spite of his initial resistance. The school-level cheating eventually spirals into an international-level fraud. What works in this ambitious plan-gone-horribly-awry kind of thriller is the taut storytelling that doesn’t lose its focus even as it builds the tension.

"Watch video of Ranveer Singh passionately cheering for Team India on David Warner’s dismissal, Shah Rukh Khan and son Aryan’s composed response","Ranveer Singh, along with his actor-wife Deepika Padukone, sister-in-law Anisha, and Shah Rukh Khan and family cheered for Team India as it played against Australia on Sunday in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final.","The ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final between India and Australia on Sunday, had many Bollywood celebrities cheering for the Men In Blue at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi stadium. Actor Ranveer Singh, an ardent fan of sport, was in the stands along with his actor-wife Deepika Padukone, sister-in-law Anisha, and Shah Rukh Khan and family. A video of the actor has surfaced on the internet where he is seen passionately applauding Team India after the dismissal of Australian batsman David Warner.
In the video, as Warner walks out of the field, the camera pans to an enthusiastic Ranveer, who is shouting “Come on”. He then takes a sigh of relief and encourages the Indian supporters in the stands to cheer the loudest for their team. At some moments, he also seems to be intensely tense as it was a crucial game.
Shah Rukh and Gauri, who are standing beside Ranveer, look composed while applauding for Team India. Shah Rukh’s elder son, Aryan Khan is also in a zen mode. Deepika, on the other hand, continues to look tense.

But despite an unfavourable end, the actor, who essayed the role of former cricketer Kapil Dev in 2021 film 83, applauded the Indian players for giving their all to the game.
Ranveer wrote on Instagram, “Some highs, some lows. Some good days, some bad days. Some wins, some losses. That’s sport. That’s life. We are all gutted, but let’s applaud our boys for giving it their all.”

"Tiger 3 box office collection day 9: Salman Khan’s action film inches towards Rs 400 crore worldwide, registers lowest single-day haul yet",Tiger 3 box office collection day 9: Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif's spy thriller is closing in on the Rs 250 crore mark domestically and the Rs 400 crore mark worldwide.,"Salman Khan‘s Tiger 3 registered its lowest single-day box office haul yet on day nine of release, as it collected Rs 6.5 crore all languages in India according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The action film has been sluggish at the box office despite a strong opening on Diwali. Overall, the film’s domestic collections stand at Rs 236 crore, with Rs 250 crore on the cards but Rs 300 crore almost certainly out of reach. By comparison, the the fourth film in YRF’s Spy Universe, Pathaan, made more than Rs 500 crore domestically through the course of its theatrical run earlier this year.
Pathaan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, also made over Rs 1000 crore worldwide, a number that Tiger 3 will be lucky to gross half of. The film is inching towards the Rs 400 crore mark currently, with around Rs 380 crore in the bank. On day nine, Tiger 3 reported overall Hindi language occupancy of 13%, with revenue from Tamil and Telugu releases all but nil.

Not only does Salman not have a strong foothold in the overseas market, especially as compared to Shah Rukh, he is also struggling to capture attention in the South of India, despite repeated attempts to produce crossover hits with films such as Dabangg 3 and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. Produced on a reported budget of Rs 300 crore, Tiger 3 will likely be classified as an under-performer, especially in light of the high expectations and despite cameos from Shah Rukh and Hrithik Roshan.
There was no industry strike in India, but YRF still chose to follow the same marketing model that worked so well for Pathaan with Tiger 3, restricting its stars from talking about it to the press. But more than any other factor, what probably hurt the film was a general sense of indifference from both critics and audiences. The YRF Spy Universe will continue with War 2, which is currently in production, and a planned Tiger vs Pathaan movie after that. Tiger 3 is now the second-lowest grossing installment of the franchise, ahead of Ek Tha Tiger, but behind Tiger Zinda Hai, War and Pathaan.

National Commission for Women takes suo-moto cognizance of Mansoor Ali Khan’s comments about Trisha,"At a press conference, Mansoor Ali Khan, who was part of Vijay-Trisha's Leo, said that there was no ""bedroom scene with Trisha"" like he had with many female actors in his earlier films.","The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo moto cognizance of  Tamil actor Mansoor Ali Khan’s derogatory remarks about female actors, especially Trisha. At a press conference, Mansoor, who was part of Vijay-Trisha’s Leo, said that there was no “bedroom scene with Trisha” like he had with many female actors in his earlier films. His crass and misogynistic statement is facing severe backlash from many celebrities including Leo’s director Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is admittedly a fan of Mansoor’s acting. Now, National Commission for Women has taken suo moto cognizance of the matter.
An official tweet from NCW states that they have directed Deputy General of Police to invoke IPC Section 509 B and other relevant laws against Mansoor. The section is for sexual harassment by electronic mode. According to the section of Indian Penal Code, “Whoever, by means of telecommunication device or by any other electronic mode including internet, makes creates, solicits or initiates the transmission of any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication, which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent with intent to harass or cause or having knowledge that it would harass or cause annoyance or mental agony to a woman shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/national-commission-for-women-takes-suo-moto-cognizance-of-mansoor-ali-khans-comments-about-trisha-9034562/,entertainment
Emraan Hashmi on how he approached his negative role in Tiger 3: ‘Play him like the hero’,"Emraan Hashmi, who played the negative role of Aatish Rehman, an ex-ISI agent, in Tiger 3, talked about his approach towards his character and why he didn't play him like a villain.","The worst way to approach a negative character is to play it like one, says actor Emraan Hashmi, who decided to portray his Tiger 3 character like an “anti-hero”.
Hashmi said he saw his character of Aatish Rehman, an ex-ISI agent, as someone whose ideology does not match with the viewpoint of the protagonist, played by Salman Khan in the film.
“You have to tap into the darker side, but eventually the dynamics are the same. You have to be clear about the vision of the director. You bring in your own ideas for the character’s journey, the nuances and body language, and finally play him like the hero of his own narrative. Don’t play it like a villain because that’s the worst way to approach the antagonist as then it becomes unidimensional,” Hashmi told PTI in an interview.

“More than a villain, he is an anti-hero, his ideology is different from the viewpoint of the protagonist. He is the hero of his own narrative. So, I had to play it from that perspective and not make him into a typical villain,” he added.
Hashmi has played negative roles of varying shades in films such as Murder, Gangster, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai and Chehre in the past.
For Tiger 3, he said the film’s team experimented with ten distinct looks. But they chose to not depict him as a stylish adversary.
“This was not pre-decided that he is going to look this way, the salt-and-pepper hair. We felt he is not someone who cares about his look. He is not a manicured villain. I decided that he will be cool, sleek, (will wear) a Ray-Ban (glasses), leather jacket kind of guy, because he is also a spy”, he said.

Released on November 12, Tiger 3 has collected Rs 220.25 crore nett in India in seven days. The action thriller is directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films.
The film is a follow-up to Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and a part of YRF’s ambitious spy universe that also includes Shah Rukh Khan’s character from Pathaan and Hrithik Roshan’s Kabir from War franchise. Tiger 3 sees Katrina Kaif returning as former ISI agent Zoya alongside Salman Khan’s super spy, Avinash Singh Rathore.
Hashmi said it was enjoyable to share the screen space with Salman as they already knew each other. He said, “He is very comfortable to be around with. I’m fond of him and he is fond of me, so it was easy and a joy working on the set with him. I was having fun, he was having fun with the action bit. We had a good action team and it was very interesting to see the kind of moves we had in the final fight.”
Casting for Tiger 3 came as a surprise for Hashmi who thought the film would be something similar to what Sharma had directed in YRF when he was approached to meet the director. Sharma is known for movies such as Band Baaja Baarat, Ladies Vs Ricky Behl, Shuddh Desi Romance and Fan.

“He said it is for the Tiger franchise. It (meeting) was during Covid-19, so I had my mask on, I removed my mask and he was like, ‘You got a chocolate face but it’s for the villain in the film!’. He was like, ‘Emraan, if you don’t mind, we want to do a test’. I was like, ‘Go for it’. It is very important for a huge film to be clear if someone fits in visually for the character. Before I did the look test, he was like, ‘You are seeing the character the way I’m seeing it, and I’m getting a good feeling about this. Let’s do this’,” he said.
There was speculation that Hashmi had joined the project as the main antagonist but the makers decided to keep it a secret for a long time.
“I knew you all (media) knew but I was not allowed to speak about it, so I had to make a joke about it and say, ‘I’m not part of it’ and lie through my teeth. The reason behind this was that the large portion of the audience should have been kept in the dark,” he added.

Javed Akhtar blames marketing department for restraining creativity of lyricists: ‘They control the creativity’,"In a recent interview, Javed Akhtar defended writers and said that they have a lot of potential but their creativity is curbed by the marketing department.","Screenwriter, lyricist and poet Javed Akhtarhas penned many iconic songs in his illustrious career. During his recent conversation, Javed was asked about his opinion on the current Hindi music industry and why most recent songs sound like a clone of each other. Defending the lyricists, Akhtar said that the writers have a lot of potential but their creativity is curbed by the marketing department.
In an interview with CNN News 18, he said, “I will not blame the songwriters at all. It is not that they are not talented, some of them are very talented, and they have great vocabulary at their disposal one can see that, they can do much better work than what they are doing. The problem is with the marketing department that controls the creativity and so the creativity suffers. Many things are not in favour of the writers. Most current generation directors have been bought up on Western and continental cinema, so they are a bit shy of lip-syncing songs and most of the songs are played in the background, and lip-syncing songs are the so-called item songs, which are not supposed to be taken seriously.”

Zoya Akhtar says other debutants in The Archies ‘robbed off’ their moment as focus on star kids: ‘People don’t even know their first names’,"The Archies marks the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana, megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson Agastya and actor Sridevi and film producer Boney Kapoor’s daughter Khushi.","Filmmaker Zoya Akhtar says the conversation around privilege is genuine and one that must be had, but are people looking at it with nuance? Not really, the director says as she gears up for her latest feature The Archies, which became the talking point on the internet since its first announcement for being the debut of three industry kids.
The Archies marks the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana, megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson Agastya and actor Sridevi and film producer Boney Kapoor’s daughter Khushi. Along with them, the upcoming Netflix feature will also see the debut of Mihir Ahuja, Dot., Vedang Raina and Yuvraj Menda.

When The Archies cast was first reported, a section on the internet reignited the conversation around nepotism in the film industry. In an interview with Indianexpress.com, Zoya said while the debate is important, it is slightly misplaced.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There is definitely a conversation of have and have nots, there is definitely a conversation of people with privilege and those without. May be the film industry has become a symbol of it to some level, but I think what people need to ask for is what they really want. Better school, better education? By denying someone a career of their choice, that’s not going to make anything better for you. So I understand that to the root of it there is something but just this conversation is not taking it anywhere. It is not changing anything,” she said.
Daughter of writer Javed Akhtar and actor writer Honey Irani, Zoya said her parents came to the industry with nothing and built their career. As their daughter, Zoya said, she inherited their skills and contacts and yet it took her close to a decade to make her first film. the filmmaker said if she wasn’t good at her job, she wouldn’t have had people put faith–and money–on her.

“When my parents came to the film industry, my father came with nothing. He made his life here from nothing. I have inherited his love for writing and films and his contacts. Now what I should I do? Not continue to do what I want or not follow what I have learnt through osmosis. I love the movies and why will I not follow that?
“You can’t rig the game. If I was making films that nobody watched, I would not have this job. It is a fair game. There is truth to the privilege conversation– but that’s a separate debate, this (blaming film industry) is not going to help that,” she added.

Filmmaker Reema Kagti, who has produced The Archies with Zoya through their production house Tiger Baby, said the “nepotism” debate in the context of The Archies has no merit. “In this context I feel it doesn’t hold at all. There are seven people in the film, but people are only talking about the three. Some people don’t even know their first names!”

Zoya said it is painful how the other young actors aren’t getting their due as of yet, but that is not done by design by them or Netflix. The director, giving an example of how nepotism needs to be looked at with more nuance, said Reema, an outsider, got to make her first film even before she did, despite being an industry kid.
“It is really sad because there are four other kids being launched and they were robbed off that moment. I feel bad for them, they were equally excited, even their parents. That’s not fair. That’s not something that we or Netflix did. You are talking to me about nepotism, I am born and bred here and it took me seven years to make my first movie. Reema (an outsider) came and made her first film before me! It is not so black and white. I wish people were more nuanced about it and see it for wat it really is,” she added.
The Indian adaptation of the beloved classic is seen through the lens of the Anglo-Indian community as the group of teenagers wrestle with love, heartache, friendship and rebellion. The Archies trailer offers a glimpse into the world of the film, set in the fictional hilly town of Riverdale, in the ’60s India.

The Archies is directed by Zoya, who has co-written it with Reema and Ayesha Devitre. The film will stream on Netflix from December 7.

Zeenat Aman: Bollywood’s first ‘sex symbol’ who made ‘foolish choices’ in life and stayed unlucky in love,"Zeenat Aman entered the film industry in 1971 and burst the idealistic bubble of the 1950s and 1960s, paving way for a more realistic portrayal of women, who until then were either vamps or sati-savitri. But she made some ""foolish mistakes"" in her personal life.","In its almost 70-decade history, Hindi cinema has seen female leads transform from ‘dukhiyaari’ and ‘bechaari’ to ones who live on their own terms. Not just the roles they play, but even their look has evolved. And, the one actress who has enabled actresses of today to showcase their sultry side unabashedly and wear whatever they choose is Zeenat Aman. It is Zeenat who broke the template of ‘traditional is beautiful’, followed staunchly by her predecessors, and made way for the likes of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai and Alia Bhatt, among others, to look stylish, wear modern clothes and embrace their sensuality on-screen.
Zeenat Aman entered the film industry in 1971 and burst the idealistic bubble of the 1950s and 1960s, paving way for a more realistic portrayal of women, who until then were divided into either vamps or sati-savitri. In fact, the first time people took notice of her was when she was smoking marijuana, wearing bohemian prints and bindis, and living like a hippie in Hare Rama Hare Krishna. She played Janice, Dev Anand’s young sister who consumed drugs, a role rejected by many lead actresses of the time.

When asked if she was going to marry him, she told Mid-Day, “I just put out one post on Instagram because sometimes I think when people keep quiet, their silence is mistaken for weakness or fear. I just wanted to put out one post to let them know that I’m laughing. After that, I was done with it.”

At the time, Sushmita’s Instagram post read, “I am in a happy place!!!😁🤗❤️💃🏻💋NOT MARRIED…NO RINGS Unconditionally surrounded by love!!🌈 Enough clarification given…now back to life & work!!😊❤️👍” She added in her interview that people were calling her a “gold digger” while they were monetising their social media content about her. “I had to put it out there because I was like, memes and all are great but then if you are calling someone a gold digger, then at least don’t monetise your post,” she said.
Lalit Modi had put on social media that they were “just dating each other” and “not married” but he added that marriage “will happen one day.” When asked about her plans of marrying him, she said in the interview, “If I was gong to marry someone, I would be married to them. I don’t try. I either do it or I don’t.”

"Sushmita Sen reveals how she paid the bills when roles dried up, says she reached out to streamers for work when she was ‘jobless’",Sushmita Sen recently said that her sabbatical extended beyond her initial expectations and she found herself as a single mom with bills to pay but sans a job.,"A proud mother of two daughters, Sushmita Sen surprised many with her decision to step back from the film industry and prioritise her family. This choice, made at the height of her professional success, raised eyebrows among those who expected her to continue at full throttle. Recalling the period when she adopted her second daughter, Alisah, in 2010 when she was just one month old, Sushmita recently shared that her decision to take a break was driven by a desire to avoid being separated from her kids. However, she stated that the hiatus extended beyond her initial expectations and she found herself as a single mom with bills to pay but sans a job.
“I can’t leave her with her nanny and be doing something I don’t like. Of course, I did have my then-manager and people from the industry, friends, who dubbed my decision as hara-kiri and said that I was making a very big blunder,” she said during an interview with Mid-Day.

“They said this is the prime of my age and advised me not to quit. However, I wasn’t quitting; I was just taking a break. But, who takes a break? It’s a very male-driven industry, so, as a woman, you have only so much time to look your best. I told them they were probably right, but inside me, there was a voice asking me not to do it. I have to listen to that voice because it has worked for me my whole life,” she added.

  A post shared by Renée Sen (@reneesen47)
Sushmita stated that the break continued for a longer period than she expected. “The scripts that were coming, they also dried up, obviously because I wasn’t visible.” At this point, she was a single mom with bills to pay but no job as an actor. Sushmita recalled that her association with Renee Jewellers and the endorsements she had helped her move forward. “We had branches of Renee Jewellers all over the Middle East. So, we were looking into that, and I was also doing some endorsements.”

Between 2010 and 2012, she also ran the Miss Universe franchise from India, at a time when it was owned by former US President Donald Trump.

Expressing that Alisah herself served as the inspiration for her return to work, Sushmita recounted an incident from 2012 when her daughter provided her with a candid career evaluation. “She was eight, and one day she saw some paps under our house and asked me why they were taking pictures of me. I told her it’s because I am famous, to which she asked, ‘doing what?’ When I told her I was Miss Universe, she reminded me that it was a long time ago. Then, when I told her I am an actor too, she responded by saying that I don’t act anymore. I said that’s because I wanted to be with her…”
“But then I realised that the time had come. She was kind of telling me off and trying to encourage me to break free from my inertia, go back to what I am supposed to do.”

Reflecting on reaching out to the heads of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar et al, Sushmita emphasised the unforgettable nature of the experience. “I was jobless. I had no experience in the last eight years. The world had changed dramatically, and OTT had shown up. I was loving the content on OTT. I personally made the calls because I wanted them to know I was hungry.”
Acknowledging that her children aren’t particularly fond of her movies, Sushmita described them as her grounding factor. “They are the biggest critics of every little thing. They are very proud of the person I am, but they are not always very proud of the work I do, which is absolutely fair.”

It is fair to say that seldom do heroines get a chance to, for lack of a better word, perform in films. And even when they do, mostly the performances that involve a lot of crying and, at times, wailing get deemed as the best. Or in the old times, playing a ‘bold’ character like Sripriya’s Manju in Aval Apadithaan (1978), Lakshmi’s Ganga in Sila Nerangalil Sila Manitharagal (1977), or Saritha’s Sevanthi in Thaneer Thaneer (1981) gets invariably deemed as best performance. A female actor either has to be in a sob story or in a provocative film. Priyamani’s Muthazhagu in Paruthiveeran is a relatively modern example. Let’s not digress into the topic of why even the monickers given to female actors are just female versions of the male actors’. Sometimes it gets worse like calling Saritha or Radhika Sarathkumar the Lady Sivaji. That’s a whole different topic. Let’s just assume such titles, despite their innate sexism, mean particular heroines are not just much-wanted actors but also artistes who can ‘perform’. And on top of that, she can do big-budget ‘female-centric films’. Nayanthara is all that. However, she is unique than all the aforementioned female actors because she got there by doing roles that didn’t involve wailing a lot, nor was it the quintessential ‘Bharathi Kanda Pudhumai Pen’ (Poet Bharathi’s idea of a modern woman). She did something as unique as Kadambari in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. It is fair to say the film changed the career of Nayanthara. It is because we finally got to see that the star can be much more than Tamil cinema’s Lora Croft.
Not just Nayanthara’s role, director Vignesh Shivan’s film itself was a bit eccentric and unique. Naanum Rowdy Dhaan (I am a rowdy too) is about a cowardly youngster’s desperation to become a rowdy as he thinks that’s cooler than being a cop like his mom. The title is borrowed from Vadivelu’s comedy segment from Thalai Nagaram (2006), where the ace comedian plays a pretend gangster. But Naanum Rowdy Dhaan is more about the heroine Kadambari than its hero Pandian (Vijay Sethupathi). In a sense, Naanum Rowdy Thaan is a converse of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. Here, it’s the guy who exists just to help the brooding/grieving girl. As far as the plot goes, Kadambari is on a mission to kill a dreaded gangster Killivalavan (Parthiban), the man responsible for the death of both her father and mother. She has also lost her hearing because of the don, who is now a politician. When Pandian falls for Kadambari, she wants him to team up with her in the revenge saga. Thus begins the journey of the couple to hunt down the demon. Undoubtedly, without the effective performance of Nayanthara, the film would have lost its impact as she has to be this emotional quirk in the movie, which is otherwise in a perennial jolly mood.

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of years of rape and abuse by singer Cassie in lawsuit,"Cassie, now 37, said Sean “Diddy” Combs, now 54, began the pattern of abuse as soon as their relationship did.","Sean “Diddy” Combs, was accused in a lawsuit Thursday of subjecting R&B singer Cassie to a yearslong relationship that included beatings and rape.
Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, alleged in the suit filed against the producer and music mogul in New York federal court that Combs brought her into his “ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle” not long after she met him and signed to his label when she was 19 and he was 37 in 2005.
Attorney Ben Brafman said Combs “vehemently denies” the allegations.
Ventura, now 37 herself, said Combs, now 54, began the pattern of abuse as soon as their relationship did.

The suit alleges that, “prone to uncontrollable rage,” he subjected her to “savage” beatings in which he punched, kicked and stomped her. It alleges he plied her with drugs, and forced her to have sex with other men while he masturbated and filmed them.
The suit says that as she was trying to end the relationship in 2018, Combs forced her into her Los Angeles home and raped her.
“After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,” Ventura said in a statement.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Ventura has.
Brafman called the allegations “lies”.

“For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,” he said in a statement. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.”
Ventura’s lawyer Douglas Wigdor responded in a statement that Combs offered her “eight figures to silence her and prevent her the filing of this lawsuit. She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence.”
Combs is among the most influential hip-hop producers and executives of the past three decades. He and Ventura began dating in 2007 and had an on-and-off relationship for more than a decade.
She became known for the Ryan Leslie-produced hit single “Me & U,” which secured the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart in 2006. The song was the lead single of her only studio album, which was self-titled.
ADVERTISEMENT
As an actor, she has appeared in several television and films projects including Fox’s Empire, Step Up 2:The Streets and Spenser Confidential.
Combs built one of hip-hop’s biggest empires, blazing a trail with several entities attached to his famous name. He is the founder of Bad Boy Records and a three-time Grammy winner who has worked with a slew of top-tier artists including Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and 112.
The mogul created the fashion clothing line Sean John, launched the Revolt TV channel with a focus on music, and produced the reality show Making the Band for MTV.
This year, he released his fifth studio album The Love Album: Off the Grid, which earned two Grammy nominations this month.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuit cites a speech Combs gave while receiving a lifetime achievement honor at the BET Awards in 2022, in which he thanked Ventura for “holding me down in the dark times, love”.
The suit says, “The truth, however, is that Cassie — Ms. Casandra Ventura — was held down by Mr. Combs and endured over a decade of his violent behavior and disturbed demands.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/music/sean-diddy-combs-accused-of-years-of-rape-and-abuse-by-singer-cassie-in-lawsuit-9031348/,entertainment

The Gladiator director and star reunited after more than two decades to make the upcoming Napoleon Bonaparte biopic Napoleon, which premiered in London on Thursday.
“It was exactly the same,” Scott said of working with Phoenix, jokingly adding “I like stress,” when asked what he liked about his leading man.
The film portrays Napoleon, a historical figure both revered and criticised in France, as a ruthless military tactician whose softer, vulnerable side was uncovered by his wife Josephine, played by British actress Vanessa Kirby.

In addition to collaborating with Phoenix, Ridley Scott said he also wanted to return to a theme he first explored in his feature film debut in 1977.
“In The Duellists I end on Napoleon Bonaparte. That’s the reason why. I enjoy that part of France and the whole ambience of that culture. So, I wanted to go back to it completely with Napoleon,” he told Reuters on the red carpet.
The director, 85, whose long career includes hit films such as Thelma & Louise, Alien and The Martian, said his production team was dedicated to making the historical epic look accurate.
“Every aspect of what you see from armoury to horses to saddles to hats, to the wardrobe, it’s all researched. I sit there like an octopus glomming all this stuff coming at me because they’ve researched everyone.

“I’m like a child, I look at picture books. I go ‘I like that’. So, I don’t do anything.”
Filmed during the pandemic, Ridley Scott and his frequent collaborator for cinematography, Dariusz Wolski, orchestrated elaborate battle scenes, that recounted Napoleon’s conquests in Austerlitz and Moscow, and his famous defeat in Waterloo.
“Since the beginning of the pandemic I’ve made The Last Duel, Gucci, Napoleon Bonaparte, and I’m halfway through Gladiator (2). We don’t stop. We ran that protecting it like an army. I had no COVID problems at all,” Scott said.
Napoleon is out in cinemas on November 24.
