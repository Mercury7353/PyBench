You can give the code and get the execution result of your code. You should use the codeinterpreter in the following format: \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n``` \n<|execute_end|> \n\n\nWARNING:Do not use cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()!!! Or the program will be destoried\n\nEach round, your answer should ALWAYS use the following format(Each of your response should contain code, until you complete the task):\n\n\nAnalyse:(Analyse the message you received and plan what you should do)  \n\nThis Step Todo: One Subtask need to be done at this step  \n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n\n```  \n<|execute_end|>\n\n\nYou will got the result of your code after each step.

When you want to draw a plot, use plt.savefig() and print the image path in markdown format instead of plt.show()\n2. Save anything to ./output folder.\n3.

The x-coordinate of the vertex for a parabola in standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).
