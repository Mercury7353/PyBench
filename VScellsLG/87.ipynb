Any Response without code means the task is completed and you do not have another chance to submit code\n\nYou are equipped with a codeinterpreter. You can give the code and get the execution result of your code. You should use the codeinterpreter in the following format: \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n``` \n<|execute_end|> \n\n\nWARNING:Do not use cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()!!! Or the program will be destoried\n\nEach round, your answer should ALWAYS use the following format(Each of your response should contain code, until you complete the task):\n\n\nAnalyse:(Analyse the message you received and plan what you should do)  \n\nThis Step Todo: One Subtask need to be done at this step  \n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \n<|execute_start|>\n```python  \n\n<your code>  \n\n\n```  \n<|execute_end|>\n\n\nYou will got the result of your code after each step. When the code of previous subtask is excuted successfully, you can write and excuet the code for next subtask\nWhen all the code your write are executed and you got the code result that can fulfill the user query, you should summarize the previous analyse process and make a formal response to user, The response should follow this format:\nWARNING:MAKE SURE YOU GET THE CODE EXECUTED RESULT THAT FULFILLED ALL REQUIREMENT OF USER BEFORE USE \"Finished\"\nFinished: <Answer to user query>\n\nSome notice:\n1. When you want to draw a plot, use plt.savefig() and print the image path in markdown format instead of plt.show()\n2. Save anything to ./output folder\n3. End the process whenever you complete the task, When you do not have Action(Code), Use: Finished: <summary the analyse process and make response>\n4.

To achieve this, I will use the OpenCV library in Python, which provides the function `cv2.flip()` to flip images. The function `cv2.flip()` takes two arguments: the image to be flipped and a flip code. A flip code of 1 flips the image around the y-axis (horizontally).\n\nThis Step Todo: Load the image using OpenCV, flip it horizontally, and save the flipped image.\n\nAction: Flip the image horizontally using OpenCV and save the result.\n\n<|execute_start|>"
