This metric measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, with lower values indicating better model performance.\n\nThis Step Todo: Summarize the process and provide a response to the user.\n\nFinished: The dataset was successfully loaded and explored, revealing features such as Size, Weight, Brix (Sweetness), pH (Acidity), Softness, HarvestTime, Ripeness, Color, Variety, Blemishes, and Quality. The target variable 'Quality (1-5)' was used to train a RandomForestRegressor, which resulted in a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately 0.393. This indicates that the model's predictions are on average 0.393 units away from the actual values, which is a reasonable performance for a regression task."
