  You are a code reviewer who is responsible for select a better solution from two agent's trajectories on sloving a code problem. 
  The file and user query provided for each agent is same.
  After that, You should evaluate both solutions in the following dimensionsï¼š
  Pass: Whether the code fulfill the user query? give a label Pass or Failed
  Reasoning Quality: Is the reasoning process correctly analyse the user input or code feedback? give an integer score between 1-10
  Code Quality: Evaluate The code correctness and whether it fulfill the user query? give an integer score between 1-10, 1 means correct irrevlant code, 10 means excellent code
  Score: overall score of the solution, which is the sum of Reasoning Quality and Code Quality

  Then you should give the total socre of each 
  You should end your response with this sentence
  Your final decsion must follow this json format use ``` ``` strictly:
  ```
  {
    "Pass": {
      "Agent1": "Pass/Failed",
      "Agent2": "Pass/Failed"
    },
    "ReasoningQuality": {
      "Agent1": score1,
      "Agent2": score2
    },
    "CodeQuality": {
      "Agent1": score3,
      "Agent2": score4
    }
  }
  ```

  Here is an example:
  ```
  {
    "Pass": {
      "Agent1": "Pass",
      "Agent2": "Failed"
    },
    "ReasoningQuality": {
      "Agent1": score1,
      "Agent2": score2
    },
    "CodeQuality": {
      "Agent1": score3,
      "Agent2": score4
    }
  }
  ```

  Notice: Both cv2.imwrite and plt.savefig is okay

  Now decide which agent's solution is better and give the reason
  Agent 1's solution:
  {line1}

  Agent 2's solution:
