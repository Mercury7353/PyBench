A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further fine-\ntuning with specific instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta’s series of Llama [ 4,20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [ 21], StarCoder [ 12], Alpaca [ 22],\nVicuna [ 23], and WizardLM [ 24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25–35].\n∗Equal contribution.

Self-Consistency [ 34] also achieves remarkable perfor-\nmance on many reasoning benchmarks, which generates several possible answers from the model\nand selects the correct one based on majority vote [ 35]. In recent, [ 36] finds that process supervision\nwith reinforcement learning significantly outperforms outcome supervision for solving challenging\nMATH problems.\nInspired by Evol-Instruct and Process-supervised Reinforcement Learning, this work aims to enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of the SOTA open-source LLM, Llama-2 [ 20]. As shown in the\nFigure 1, we propose a new method named Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which could firstly generate\ndiverse math instructions data by math-specific Evol-Instruct , then we train an instruction reward\nmodel (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM) [ 16,36–41], the former indicates the\nquality of the evolved instruction and the later receives feedback for each step in the solution. The\nbrand-new Evol-Instruct method includes two downward evolution and upward evolution progress to\nproduce the grade school math and challenging math respectively. Initially, we re-generate, filter and\nfinetune the original math instruction data from GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43]. Immediately, we train\nthe Llama-2 models to obtain the reward models and our WizardMath .\nWe perform experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k [ 42] and\nMATH [ 43], the results demonstrate that our WizardMath outperforms all other open-source LLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, WizardMath observe a substantial improvement\nin pass@1 with an increase of +24.8 (81.6. vs. 56.8) on GSM8k, and +9.2 (22.7 vs. 13.5) on MATH.\nNotably, our model even also significantly surpasses OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.55, Anthropic’s Claude\nInstant-1 [39], and Google’s PaLM-2 [44] in terms of pass@1 on GSM8k.\nThe main contributions of this work are as following:\n•We introduce WizardMath model, which enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities for\nopen-source pretrained large language model Llama-2 [20].\n2•We propose a new method, Reinforced Evol-Instruct , alongside Evol-Instruct and Reinforce-\nment Learning, for improving LLM reasoning performance.\n•WizardMath surpasses all other open-source LLMs by a substantial margin in terms of math-\nematical reasoning, including Llama-2 70B [ 20], Llama-1 65B [ 4], Falcon-40B [ 21], MPT-\n30B8, Baichuan-13B Chat9and ChatGLM2 12B [ 45] on both GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43].\n•WizardMath significantly outperforms various main closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT5,\nGPT-3.5, Claude Instant [39], PaLM-2 [44], PaLM-1 [7] and Minerva[15] on GSM8k.\n2 Method\nIn this section, we elaborate on the details of our WizardMath . Following WizardLM and PRMs[ 36],\nwe propose Reinforced Evol-Instruct , which integrates the Evol-Instruct and reinforced process\nsupervision method to evolve GSM8k and MATH, and fine-tune the pre-trained Llama-2 with the\nevolved data and reward models.\nAs shown in the Figure 1, our methods apply three steps:\n1. Supervised fine-tuning.\n2. Training instruction reward model, and process-supervised reward model.\n3. Active Evol-Instruct, and PPO training.\n2.1 Supervised fine-tuning\nFollowing InstructGPT[ 2], we also firstly fine tune the base with supervised instruction-response\npairs, which contains:\n1.To make the parsing of each step easier, we few-shot re-generate 15k answers for GSM8k\nand MATH with an Alpha version of WizardLM 70B model to produce solutions in a\nstep-by-step format, then find out those with a correct answer, and use this data to finetune\nbase Llama model.\n2.To enhance the model’s ability to adhere to the neural and diverse instructions, we also\nsample 1.5k open-domain conversations from WizardLM’s training data, then merge it with\nabove math corpus as the final SFT training data.\n2.2 Evol-Instruct principles for math\nMotivated by the Evol-Instruct [ 24] method proposed by WiazrdLM and its effective application\non WizardCoder [ 13], this work attempts to make math instructions with various complexities and\ndiversity to enhance the pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, we adapt Evol-Instruct to a new paradigm\nincluding two evolution lines:\n1.Downward evolution: It enhances instructions by making the questions easier. For example\ni): revising high difficulty questions to lower difficulty, or ii) producing a new and easier\nquestion with another different topic.\n2.Upward evolution: Derived from original Evol-Instruct method, it deepens and generates\nnew and harder questions by i) adding more constraints, ii) concretizing, iii) increasing\nreasoning.\n2.3 Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nInspired by InstructGPT[ 2] and PRMs[ 36], we train two reward models to predict the quality of the\ninstructions and the correctness of each step in the answer respectively:\n1.Instruction Reward Model (IRM): This model aims to judge the quality of the evolved\ninstructions on three aspects: i) Definition, ii) Precision, and iii) Integrity. To produce\nthe ranking list training data of IRM, for each instruction, we firstly use ChatGPT and\n3Figure 2: The pass@1 performance of main LLM models on the GSM8k benchmark, our model is\ncurrently ranked in the top five, slightly outperforming some close-source models such as ChatGPT-\n3.55, Claude Instant-16, PaLM 2 [44], and substantially surpassing all open-source models.\nWizard-E4to generate 2~4 evolved instructions respectively. Then we leverage Wizard-E to\nrank the quality of those 4~8 instructions.\n2.Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM): As there is no powerful open-source math\nreasoning LLMs before this work, there is no simple way to support highly precise process\nsupervision without professional human-labelers and close-source ChatGPT. Therefore, we\ndepend on ChatGPT to provide process supervision, and ask it to assess the correctness of\neach step in the solutions generated by our model.\n3.PPO training. We evolve the original math (GSM8k + MATH) instructions by 8 turns,\nincreasing the data size from 15k to 96k. We use IRM and PRM to generate the instruction\nreward ( rI) and the answer reward ( rA). Then apply a product as the final reward r=rI·rA.\n3 Experiment\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of the baseline models in our experiments. Subse-\nquently, we mainly elucidate the performance metrics of our models on two prevalent mathematical\nbenchmarks: GSM8k [42] and MATH [43].\n3.1 Baselines\nClose-Source Models. Numerous technology companies have effectively created exceptionally\nproficient Large Language Models (LLMs) [ 3,4,7,20,44,45,47,51–53], but have opted against\nmaking them publicly available, so they are referred to as close-source models. In our research, we\nextensively integrate a significant number of close-source models as the foundational benchmarks.\nSpecifically, our baselines encompass the following models: (i) OpenAI’s GPT-3 [ 51], GPT-3.5,\n4Wizard-E named Wizard-Evol-Generator, which is an Alpha version fine-tuned Llama model specifically\nused to execute Evol-Instruct without APIs.\n4Table 1: Results of pass@1 (%) on GSM8k and MATH.

Massive open-source LLMs [ 4,20–23,45,52,53] have been accessible to\nthe AI community. Nonetheless, their performance consistently tends to significantly lag behind the\nclose-source models. As part of our research, we incorporate a significant number of these open-\nsource models as our baselines, which mainly contain the following: Llama 1 [ 4] & Llama 2 [ 20],\nGAL [ 14], GPT-J [ 48], GPT-Neo [ 50], Vicuna [ 23], MPT8, Falcon[ 21], Baichuan9, ChatGLM [ 45],\nQwen10and RFT [16].\n3.2 Evaluate Benchmarks\nWe mainly evaluate WizardMath on two benchmarks (GSM8k [ 42] and MATH [ 43]). The\nGSM8k [ 42] dataset contains approximately 7500 training data and 1319 test data, mainly on\ngrade school level math problems, each of which consists of basic arithmetic operations (addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division), and generally requires 2 to 8 steps to solve. The MATH [ 43]\ndataset collects math problems from prestigious math competitions such as AMC 10, AMC 12, and\nAIME. It contains 7500 training data and 5,000 challenging test data in seven academic areas: Preal-\ngebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting and Probability, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, and\nPrecalculus. Furthermore, these problems are divided into five levels of difficulty, with ‘1’ denoting\nthe relatively lower difficulty level and ‘5’ indicating the highest level.\n3.3 Train and Evaluation prompt\nThe Llama 2 [20] base serves as our foundation model.\nWe undertake the training of our WizardMath by employing the prompt from Alpaca [22]:\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a\nresponse that appropriately completes the request.\\n\\n###\nInstruction:\\n{instruction}\\n\\n### Response:\nWe evaluate GSM8k [ 42] and MATH benchmarks [ 43] by employing the following CoT [ 31] prompt:\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

The\nevaluation of the ChatGPT model’s scores are from [ 46]. For the assessment of Claude Instant,\nClaude 1.3, and Claude 2, the scores are extracted from7. The scores of PaLM 1, PaLM 2, and\nMinerva are garnered from [ 7,15,44]. Finally, the scores associated with Text-davinci-002, GPT-3\nand GPT-2 are garnered from [ 15,43]. On the open-source models, most scores are retrieved from the\npaper of Llama 2 [ 20] or their self-reports. Additionally, we evaluate the Baichuan-chat, Vicuna v1.3\nby ourselves. In the Table 2, we show the detailed results of MATH subtopics with our WizardMath\n70B model.\nComparing with the Close-Source Models. In Table 1, our WizardMath 70B slightly outper-\nforms some close-source LLMs on GSM8k, including ChatGPT, Claude Instant and PaLM 2 540B.\nAnd as shown in Figure 2, our model is currently ranked in the top five on all models. Simultane-\nously, WizardMath 70B also surpasses the Text-davinci-002 on MATH. The detailed results are as\nfollows:\n1.WizardMath 13B outperforms PaLM 1 540B (63.9 vs 56.5), Minerva 540B (63.9 vs 58.8),\nand GPT-3.5 (63.9 vs 57.1) on GSM8k. Meanwhile,it surpasses PaLM 1 540B (14.0 vs.\n8.8), GPT-3 175B (14.0 vs. 5.2) on MATH.\n2.WizardMath 70B , our largest model, achieves the superior or comparable performance\nwith Claude Instant (81.6 vs 80.9), ChatGPT (81.6 vs 80.8) and PaLM 2 (81.6 vs 80.7) on\nGSM8k. Concurrently, WizardMath 70B also exceeds Text-davinci-002 (22.7 vs. 19.1) by a\nmargin of 3.6% on the MATH benchmarks.\nComparing with the Open-Source Models. The findings illustrated in the table 1 explicitly\ndemonstrate that our WizardMath 70B , distinctly manifest a substantial performance advantage over\nall the open-source models across both the GSM8k and MATH benchmarks. The detailed results are\nas follows:\n1.WizardMath 7B surpasses most open-source models with parameter counts ranging approx-\nimately from 7B to 40B, including MPT, Falcon, Baichuan-chat, Vicuna v1.3, ChatGLM\n2, Qwen, Llama 1 and Llama 2 on the GSM8k and MATH benchmarks. Even though its\nparameter counts are significantly lower.\n2.WizardMath 13B is significantly superior to Llama 1 65B (63.9 vs. 50.9) and Llama 2 70B\n(63.9 vs. 56.8) on GSM8k. Additionly, it substantially outperforms both Llama 1 65B (14.0\nvs. 10.6) and Llama 2 70B (14.0 vs. 13.5) on MATH.\n3.WizardMath 70B , our most extensive model, exemplifies a substantial advancement in\nperformance, surpassing Llama 2 70B (81.6 vs. 56.8) by a significant margin of 24.8% on\nGSM8k. Concurrently, it also outperforms Llama 2 70B (22.7 vs. 13.5) by a margin of 9.2%\non MATH.\n3.5 Case Study\nAppendix A shows some examples generated by our WizardMath . The examples demonstrate that\nour model consistently generates accurate response answers accompanied by clear explanations.\n4 Related Work\nLarge Language Models. LLMs have achieved substantial advancements within the realm of Nat-\nural Language Processing (NLP), providing a valuable and task-agnostic foundation for widespread\napplications. These models typically encompass parameter counts reaching into the hundreds of\nbillions, which are trained on extensive large-scale corpuses of textual data. The prominent instances\nentail OpenAI’s GPT3&4 [ 3,51], Anthropic’s Claude7, Google’s PaLM [ 7,44], Bard11, DeepMind’s\nChinchilla [ 47], and Gopher [ 52]. However none of them have been open-sourced so far, and some\nof them can only be exclusively accessible through APIs.\n11https://bard.google.com/\n7Recently, the AI landscape has borne witness to the emergence of numerous open-source LLMs,\ncharacterized by publicly accessible model codes and weight parameters. EleutherAI has contributed\nGPT-NeoX-20B [ 54] and GPT-J-6B [ 48]. BigScience has introduced BLOOM [ 55]. Similarly,\nMeta has made strides by releasing OPT [ 53], Llama 1 [ 4], Llama 2 [ 20], and GAL [ 14]. Tsinghua\nUniversity has unveiled GLM-130B and ChatGLM [ 45]. TII has facilitated the release of Falcon [ 21].\nAdditionally, LLMs such as Baichuan9and Qwen10have also surfaced. Presently, Llama assumes a\npivotal role as the foundational model for supervised fine-tuning, ushering in the emergence of several\nextremely remarkable models, including Alpaca [ 22], Vicuna [ 23], Guanaco [ 56], WizardLM [ 24],\nand Orca [57], RFT [16] etc.\nLarge Language Models For Mathematical reasoning. It’s well known that complex reasoning\nproblems are challenging for NLP models, which include mathematical reasoning [ 25–30], common-\nsense reasoning [ 58,59], and logical reasoning [ 31]. A substantial body of current research is centered\naround the intricate task reasoning of the Mathematical Word Problems(MWP) [ 30,42,60–64], which\nrequires the ability to understand mathematical concepts, computation and multi-step reasoning [ 16–\n19,36,40,46]. Addtitionly, models are evaluated across different levels of MWP benchmarks\non some mathematical reasoning datasets such as AddSub [ 65], MultiArith [ 66], SingleEQ [ 67],\nSV AMP [60], GSM8K [42], AQuA [29] and MATH [43].\nTo enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs, [ 31] proposed Chain-of-Thought Prompting, which\nattaches multiple reasoning steps before obtaining the answer for a question. By employing the\nsimple few-shot reasoning strategy, LLMs are able to perform better in complex reasoning problems.\nLeast-to-Most [ 68] prompting decomposes the problem into sub-problems that are then solved\nincrementally. Additionally each step has a more detailed reasoning process. Similarly, the Complex\nCoT [ 35] underscores the pivotal role of prompt complexity by strategically choosing the most\nintricate problems and their corresponding solutions to function as prompts. To alleviate the burden\nof manual efforts, [ 33] introduced Auto-CoT, an approach that automates the process of acquiring k\nsamples through the application of clustering techniques on a provided dataset. With the objective\nof mitigating manual intervention, [ 32] proposed Zero-shot-CoT, which entails the straightforward\npractice of appending the phrase \"Let’s think step by step\" to each answer, eliciting the inference\nsteps without examples. Moreover, [ 34] expanded upon this notion by suggesting the exploration\nof diverse inference paths throughout the reasoning process. Consequently, the ultimate outcome\nis determined through either the aggregation of answers using majority voting or by leveraging a\nvalidation mechanism, as posited by [ 69]. [16] employs a straightforward approach for generating\naugmented samples, focusing on probing the correlation between LLMs and math reasoning ability.\nLarge Language Models For Reinforcement Learning. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models\nfrequently manifest logical errors and a range of illusions [ 70,71]. These anomalies become especially\nchallenging within domains necessitating multi-step reasoning, where a singular logical misstep\nmaybe precipitate the unraveling of an entire solution. An effective strategy involves the training\nof reward models aimed at discriminating between favorable and unfavorable outputs [ 36]. Early\noutcome-based approaches were mainly performed on algorithmic tasks [ 72–75]. [42] demonstrated\nthe significant benefits of reward models or validators, and [ 76] proposed a heuristic-based step-\nsize-aware RM. [ 2,77–79] proposed the use of reward models for a reinforcement learning pipeline.\n[20,37–39,42,80–82] employed rejection sampling for searching to achieve alignment of LLMs\nwith human preferences.\nThe differences between outcome-based and process-based reward modelling are further discussed\nby [40]. Outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs) undergo training exclusively utilizing the\nultimate outcomes derived from the model’s chain-of-thought process. Conversely, process-supervised\nreward models (PRMs) are designed to solicit feedback for each individual step within the chain-\nof-thought progression. In the domain of logical reasoning, ORMs frequently employ incorrect\nreasoning pathways yet yield the correct final answer [ 41,83]. Notably, PRMs has been demonstrated\nto effectively alleviate this phenomenon of inconsistent behavior [ 40]. [36,84,85] amassed an\nexpansive corpus of process-based supervised signals through meticulous manual annotation, which\nverified that PRMs and supervision with manual annotation yielded more pronounced advantages for\nLLMs as compared to ORMs.\nLarge Language Models For Instruction Fine-Tuning. The initial endeavors in instruction-\nfollowing training work primarily focused on enhancing the language model’s capacity for generaliza-\n8tion across diverse tasks. This often involves the process of fine-tuning across substantially available\nNatural Language Processing datasets, and evaluates on the different NLP tasks. T5 [ 86] undertake\nthe earliest attempts to train a range of NLP tasks, including Question and Answer, Document Sum-\nmarization, and Sentiment Classification, by employing a consistent prompt format across all the data.\nSubsequently, instruction fine-tuning work such as FLAN [ 87], ExT5 [ 88], T0 [ 89], UnifiedQA [ 90],\nZeroPrompt [ 91], and FLAN-T5 [ 92] emerged to adapt for a large number of downstream tasks. To\naddress the challenge of misalignment between model outputs and human requirements, OpenAI\nmanually annotates the instruction library to construct a diverse range of tasks. Simultaneously,\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technology is employed, which facilitate the rapid\ndevelopment of LLMs such as InstructGPT [ 2], ChatGPT5, GPT-4 [ 3]. To reduce manual involvement,\nself-instruct [ 93] improves instruction-following through self-generated instructions. Alpaca [ 22]\nused a dataset of 50k instructions generated from a limited (e.g., 175 samples) seed set of manually-\nwritten instructions. Vicuna [ 23] used 70k user-shared conversations with ChatGPT collected from\nShareGPT.com. Meanwhile, WizardLM [ 24] introduces the evol-instruct approach, which seeks to\nrefine the existing instruction data by enhancing both its complexity and diversity.\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis paper introduces WizardMath , a mathematics model fine-tuned with Reinforced Evol-Instruct .\nThe experimental results demonstrate that WizardMath achieves SOTA performance surpassing all\nexisting open-source LLMs on two widely recognized mathematical reasoning benchmarks: GSM8k\nand MATH. Furthermore, WizardMath exhibits superior performance compared to some of the largest\nclose-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, Claude Instant, PaLM-2, PaLM-1 and Minerva on\nthe GSM8k benchmark.\nFuture Work. Although our WizardMath achieves impressive mathematics performance, as de-\npicted in Figure 2, our model still falls significantly behind the SOTA LLM, GPT-4 and Claude-2.\nTherefore, future work will prioritize the enhancement of the Reinforced Evol-Instruct or better\nmethod to further augment the performance of our model.\nBroader Impact. Similar to the other LLMs, our WizardMath could also generate unethical,\nharmful, or misleading information sometimes. Therefore, future research to address the ethical and\nsocietal implications is needed.\n9References\n[1]Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind\nNeelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, et al.

A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week,\nshe wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday,\nshe wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent\nwriting articles in the three days.\nGround Truth Answer: 104\nNote: WizardMath 7B, 13B and 70B answer correctly.\nWizardMath-7B\nStep 1: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday.\nMeredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.\nStep 2: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.\nMeredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. So, she wrote\n2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote 5 + 2 =\n7 articles on Tuesday.\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the two days.\nIn the two days, she wrote 5 + 7 = 12 articles.\nStep 4: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday.\nMeredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday on Wednesday.\nSo, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the three days.\nIn the three days, she wrote 12 + 14 = 26 articles.\nStep 6: Calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the\nthree days.\nEach article takes 4 hours to research and write. So, she spent 4 hours * 26 = 104\nhours writing articles in the three days.\nTherefore, Meredith spent 104 hours writing articles in the three days.\nThe answer is: 104.\nWizardMath-13B\nStep 1: Find the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.\nWe know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on\nTuesday than on Monday. To find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, we\ncan multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5:\n5 articles * 2/5 = 2 articles\nSo, Meredith wrote 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. To find the total\nnumber of articles she wrote on Tuesday, we can add the 2 articles to the 5 articles\nshe wrote on Monday:\n5 articles + 2 articles = 7 articles\nStep 2: Find the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday.\nWe know that Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday on\nWednesday. So, we can multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2:\n7 articles * 2 = 14 articles\nStep 3: Find the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the three days.\nNow, we can add the number of articles she wrote on each day to find the total\nnumber of articles:\n5 articles (Monday) + 7 articles (Tuesday) + 14 articles (Wednesday) = 26 articles\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the\nthree days.\nWe know that each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.\nSo, to find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three\ndays, we can multiply the total number of articles by the number of hours per article:\n26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours\n16Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.\nThe answer is: 104.\nWizardMath-70B\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how\nmany articles she wrote on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of articles she\nwrote on Monday by 2/5. So, 5 articles * 2/5 = 2 articles. Therefore, she wrote 7\narticles on Tuesday (5 articles + 2 articles).\n3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.\nTo find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday, we need to multiply the\nnumber of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2. So, 7 articles * 2 = 14 articles.\nNow, let’s calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:\nTotal articles = Monday’s articles + Tuesday’s articles + Wednesday’s articles\nTotal articles = 5 articles + 7 articles + 14 articles = 26 articles\nSince each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, we can\ncalculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days:\nTotal hours = Total articles * Time per article\nTotal hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours\nSo, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.\nThe answer is: 104.\n17Table 4: A comparison case on different scale size models\nInstruction: A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. For each truck tire\nthat is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge\n$40. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12\ncar tries and doesn’t repair any truck tires. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with\nhigher revenue?\nGround Truth Answer: 40\nNote: WizardMath 7B answers incorrectly, while 13B and 70B answer correctly.\nWizardMath-7B\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Therefore, the\nrevenue from repairing truck tires on Thursday was 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue\nfrom repairing car tires on Thursday was 4 * $40 = $160. On Friday, the mechanic\nrepaired 12 car tires, but did not repair any truck tires. Therefore, the revenue from\nrepairing car tires on Friday was 12 * $40 = $480.\nTo calculate the total revenue from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday\nand Friday, we need to add up the revenue from each day. Therefore, the total\nrevenue from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday and Friday was $360 +\n$160 + $480 = $900.\nTo calculate the revenue from repairing truck tires on Friday, we need to know how\nmany truck tires the mechanic repaired on Friday. However, this information is not\ngiven in the question. Therefore, we cannot calculate the revenue from repairing\ntruck tires on Friday.\nTo calculate the revenue from repairing car tires on Thursday and Friday, we need\nto add up the revenue from each day. Therefore, the total revenue from repairing car\ntires on Thursday and Friday was $160 + $480 = $640.\nTo calculate the difference between the revenue from repairing truck tires and car\ntires on Thursday and Friday, we need to subtract the revenue from repairing car\ntires on Thursday and Friday from the total revenue from repairing truck tires and\ncar tires on Thursday and Friday. Therefore, the difference between the revenue\nfrom repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday and Friday was $900 - $640 =\n$260.\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $260 more on the day with higher revenue. The\nanswer is: 260.\nThe answer is: 260.\nWizardMath-13B\nStep 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The mechanic\ncharges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. Therefore, the revenue\nearned on Thursday can be calculated as follows:\nRevenue on Thursday = (Number of truck tires) * (Price per truck tire) + (Number\nof car tires) * (Price per car tire)\nRevenue on Thursday = 6 * $60 + 4 * $40\nRevenue on Thursday = $360 + $160\nRevenue on Thursday = $520\nStep 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.\nOn Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn’t repair any truck tires.\nTherefore, the revenue earned on Friday can be calculated as follows:\nRevenue on Friday = (Number of car tires) * (Price per car tire)\nRevenue on Friday = 12 * $40\nRevenue on Friday = $480\nStep 3: Compare the revenue earned on both days.\nNow, we need to compare the revenue earned on Thursday and Friday to find out\nwhich day earned more revenue.\nDifference in revenue = Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday\nDifference in revenue = $520 - $480\nDifference in revenue = $40\n18Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more in revenue on the day with higher revenue,\nwhich is Thursday. The final answer is $40.\nThe answer is: 40.\nWizardMath-70B\nStep 1: Calculate the revenue from repairing truck tires on Thursday.\nThe mechanic repaired 6 truck tires on Thursday, and each truck tire repair costs\n$60.\nSo, the revenue from repairing truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.\nStep 2: Calculate the revenue from repairing car tires on Thursday.\nThe mechanic repaired 4 car tires on Thursday, and each car tire repair costs $40.\nSo, the revenue from repairing car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.\nStep 3: Calculate the total revenue on Thursday.\nThe total revenue on Thursday is the sum of the revenue from repairing truck tires\nand car tires.\nSo, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.\nStep 4: Calculate the revenue from repairing car tires on Friday.\nThe mechanic repaired 12 car tires on Friday, and each car tire repair costs $40.\nSo, the revenue from repairing car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.\nStep 5: Calculate the total revenue on Friday.\nThe mechanic didn’t repair any truck tires on Friday, so the total revenue on Friday\nis the revenue from repairing car tires.\nSo, the total revenue on Friday is $480.\nStep 6: Calculate the difference in revenue between the two days.\nThe difference in revenue is the difference between the total revenue on the day with\nhigher revenue and the total revenue on the day with lower revenue.\nSo, the difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on the day with higher revenue.\nThe final answer is $40.\nThe answer is: 40.\n19Table 5: A comparison case on different scale size models\nInstruction: Adrien’s total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah’s. Four years later, his salary had\nincreased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien’s and Lylah’s\nsalary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the\ntwo were receiving four years later?\nGround Truth Answer: 95200\nNote: WizardMath 7B and 13B answer incorrectly, while 70B answers correctly.\nWizardMath-7B\nStep 1: Calculate Adrien’s salary four years ago.\nSince Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, his total salary four years ago was\n$40000.\nStep 2: Calculate the increase in Adrien’s salary four years later.\nFour years later, Adrien’s salary had increased by 40% of his salary four years ago.\nTherefore, the increase in Adrien’s salary was 40/100*$40000 = $16000.\nStep 3: Calculate Adrien’s total salary four years later.\nAdrien’s total salary four years later was the sum of his salary four years ago and\nthe increase in his salary. Therefore, Adrien’s total salary four years later was\n$40000+$16000 = $56000.\nStep 4: Calculate the increase in Lylah’s salary four years later.\nSince Adrien’s total salary was 30% higher than Lylah’s, the increase in Lylah’s\nsalary four years later was 30/100*$56000 = $16800.\nStep 5: Calculate Lylah’s total salary four years later.\nLylah’s total salary four years later was the sum of her salary four years ago and\nthe increase in her salary. Therefore, Lylah’s total salary four years later was\n$56000+$16800 = $72800.\nStep 6: Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.\nThe total salary the two were receiving four years later was the sum of Adrien’s\nand Lylah’s total salary four years later. Therefore, the total salary the two were\nreceiving four years later was $72800+$56000 = $128800.\nTherefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later was $128800.\nThe answer is: 128800.\nWizardMath-13B\nStep 1: Calculate Adrien’s total salary four years ago.\nWe know that Adrien’s total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah’s. If Adrien was\nearning $40000 four years ago, then Lylah was earning $40000/30/100 = $12000.\nStep 2: Calculate Adrien’s total salary four years later.\nFour years later, Adrien’s salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than\nwhat he was making four years ago. Therefore, Adrien’s total salary four years later\nis $40000 + $40000*40/100 = $56000.\nStep 3: Calculate Lylah’s total salary four years later.\nIf Adrien’s salary increased by 40%, then Lylah’s salary also increased by 40%.\nTherefore, Lylah’s total salary four years later is $12000 + $12000*40/100 = $16800.\nStep 4: Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.\nThe total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien’s and\nLylah’s total salaries. Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years\nlater is $56000 + $16800 = $72800.\nTherefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $72800.\nThe answer is: 72800.\nWizardMath-70B\nStep 1: Determine Lylah’s salary four years ago.\nSince Adrien’s total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah’s, and Adrien earned\n$40000 four years ago, we can find Lylah’s salary by subtracting 30% of $40000\nfrom Adrien’s salary.\nLylah’s salary = $40000 - (30/100)*$40000 = $40000 - $12000 = $28000\nStep 2: Calculate Adrien’s salary four years later.\n20Four years later, Adrien’s salary had increased by 40% of what he was making four\nyears ago. So, we need to add 40% of $40000 to his salary from four years ago.\nAdrien’s salary four years later = $40000 + (40/100)*$40000 = $40000 + $16000 =\n$56000\nStep 3: Calculate Lylah’s salary four years later.\nSince their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah’s salary also increased by 40%\nof what she was making four years ago. So, we need to add 40% of $28000 to her\nsalary from four years ago.\nLylah’s salary four years later = $28000 + (40/100)*$28000 = $28000 + $11200 =\n$39200\nStep 4: Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.\nNow, we just need to add Adrien’s and Lylah’s salaries from four years later to find\ntheir total salary.\nTotal salary = Adrien’s salary four years later + Lylah’s salary four years later =\n$56000 + $39200 = $95200\nSo, the total salary the two were receiving four years later was $95200.\nThe answer is: 95200.\n21A.2 MATH Case Study\nTable 6: A comparison case on different scale size models\nInstruction: The midpoint of the line segment between (x, y)and(−9,1)is(3,−5).

So, we can plug these values into\nthe midpoint formula:\n\u0012x+ (−9)\n2,y+ 1\n2\u0013\nStep 4: Simplify the expression\nNow, we can simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations:\n\u0012x−9\n2,y+ 1\n2\u0013\nStep 5: Compare the coordinates\nWe are given that the midpoint is (3,−5). So, we can compare the coordinates of\nthe simplified expression with the given midpoint:\nx−9\n2= 3\ny+ 1\n2=−5\nStep 6: Solve for the coordinates\nNow, we can solve for the coordinates of (x, y)by multiplying both sides of the\nequations by 2:\nx−9 = 6\ny+ 1 = −10\nStep 7: Write the final answer\nNow, we can write the final answer by adding the results of the equations:\nx= 6 + 9\n22y=−10−1\nx= 15\ny=−11\nSo, the coordinates of (x, y)are(15,−11).\nThe answer is: (15,-11).\nWizardMath-13B\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that the midpoint of the line segment between (x, y)and(−9,1)is\n(3,−5). We need to find the coordinates of the point (x, y).\nStep 2: Recall the midpoint formula\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1)and(x2, y2)can be found\nusing the midpoint formula:\nMidpoint =\u0000x1+x2\n2,y1+y2\n2\u0001\nStep 3: Apply the midpoint formula\nIn our case, the endpoints are (x, y)and(−9,1). So, we can plug these values into\nthe midpoint formula:\nMidpoint =\u0010\nx+(−9)\n2,y+1\n2\u0011\nStep 4: Simplify the midpoint\nNow, we can simplify the midpoint by performing the arithmetic operations:\nMidpoint =\u0000x−9\n2,y+1\n2\u0001\nStep 5: Set up an equation\nSince the midpoint is given as (3,−5), we can set up an equation using the simplified\nmidpoint formula:\nx−9\n2= 3andy+1\n2=−5\nStep 6: Solve the equations\nNow, we need to solve these two equations to find the values of xandy. Let’s start\nwith the first equation:\nx−9\n2= 3\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\nx−9 = 6\nNow, add 9 to both sides:\nx= 15\nNext, let’s solve the second equation:\ny+1\n2=−5\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\ny+ 1 = −10\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\ny=−11\nStep 7: Write the final answer\nWe have found the values of xandy. So, the coordinates of the point (x, y)are\n(15,−11). Therefore, the final answer is:\n(x, y) = (15 ,−11)\nThe answer is: (15,-11).\nWizardMath-70B\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given the midpoint of a line segment and the coordinates of one of its\nendpoints. We need to find the coordinates of the other endpoint, which is (x, y).\n23Step 2: Recall the midpoint formula\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1)and(x2, y2)is given by the\nformula:\nMidpoint =\u0000x1+x2\n2,y1+y2\n2\u0001\nStep 3: Plug in the given information\nWe know the midpoint is (3,−5)and one endpoint is (−9,1). So, we can plug these\nvalues into the midpoint formula:\n(3,−5) =\u0000−9+x\n2,1+y\n2\u0001\nStep 4: Solve for xandy\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n1)−9+x\n2= 3\n2)1+y\n2=−5\nStep 5: Solve equation 1 for x\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n−9 +x= 6\nAdd 9 to both sides:\nx= 15\nStep 6: Solve equation 2 for y\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n1 +y=−10\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\ny=−11\nStep 7: Write the final answer\nNow that we have found the values of xandy, we can write the final answer as:\n(x, y) = (15 ,−11)\nSo, the coordinates of the other endpoint are (15,−11).\nThe answer is: (15,-11).\n24Table 7: A comparison case on different scale size models\nInstruction: Evaluate tan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦.\nGround Truth Answer: 1\nNote: WizardMath 7B answers incorrectly, while 13B and 70B answer correctly.\nWizardMath-7B\nFirst, we can rewrite the given expression using the identity tan(90◦−x) =1\ntanx:\ntan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦=1\ntan 80◦\nNow, we can use the double-angle formula for tangent, which is tan 2x=2 tanx\n1−tan2x:\n1\ntan 80◦=2\ntan 160◦=2\n1−tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦=1−tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦\nNext, we can use the double-angle formula for tangent again:\n1−tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦=1−1\n2tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦=1−1\n2tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦·2 tan 80◦\n1−tan280◦\nNow, we can multiply the fractions:\n1−1\n2tan280◦\n2 tan 80◦·2 tan 80◦\n1−tan280◦=1−1\n2tan280◦\n1−tan280◦\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n1−1\n2tan280◦\n1−tan280◦= 1−1\n2tan280◦\nSo, the rewritten answer is:\ntan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦= 1 −1\n2tan280◦\nThe answer is: 1−1\n2tan280◦.\nWizardMath-13B\nStep 1: Recall the angle addition formula for tangent:\ntan(A+B) =tanA+tan B\n1−tanAtanB\nStep 2: Use the formula to find tan 110◦:\ntan 110◦= tan(10◦+ 100◦) =tan 10◦+tan 100◦\n1−tan 10◦tan 100◦=1+0\n1−1·0= 1\nStep 3: Observe that tan 110◦is the only term in the given expression that is not\nequal to 0.\nStep 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by tan 110◦:\ntan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦tan 110◦= 1 ·\ntan 110◦\nStep 5: Simplify the equation:\ntan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦= tan 110◦\nStep 6: Since tan 110◦= 1, the final answer is:\ntan 10◦tan 20◦tan 30◦tan 40◦tan 50◦tan 60◦tan 70◦tan 80◦= 1.\nThe answer is: 1.\nWizardMath-70B\nStep 1: Recall the definitions of tangent and cotangent.\n25We know that tanx=sinx\ncosxandcotx=cosx\nsinx.\nStep 2: Find the tangent and cotangent of each angle.\nWe need to find the tangent and cotangent of each angle in the given expression:\ntan 10◦=sin 10◦\ncos 10◦\ntan 20◦=sin 20◦\ncos 20◦\ntan 30◦=sin 30◦\ncos 30◦\ntan 40◦=sin 40◦\ncos 40◦\ntan 50◦=sin 50◦\ncos 50◦\ntan 60◦=sin 60◦\ncos 60◦\ntan 70◦=sin 70◦\ncos 70◦\ntan 80◦=sin 80◦\ncos 80◦\nStep 3: Find the cotangent of each angle.\nNow, we need to find the cotangent of each angle:\ncot 10◦=cos 10◦\nsin 10◦\ncot 20◦=cos 20◦\nsin 20◦\ncot 30◦=cos 30◦\nsin 30◦\ncot 40◦=cos 40◦\nsin 40◦\ncot 50◦=cos 50◦\nsin 50◦\ncot 60◦=cos 60◦\nsin 60◦\ncot 70◦=cos 70◦\nsin 70◦\ncot 80◦=cos 80◦\nsin 80◦\nStep 4: Use the identity tanxcotx= 1.\nWe know that tanxcotx= 1.

We know that f(x)is an odd function, which means that f(−x) =−f(x)for all\nxin its domain.\n2. We also know that g(x)is an even function, which means that g(−x) =g(x)for\nallxin its domain.\n3. Now, let’s find the value of f(g(−x))andf(−g(x)). Since g(−x) =g(x)and\nf(−x) =−f(x), we can conclude that:\nf(g(−x)) =f(−g(x))\n4. Next, let’s find the value of f(f(g(−x)))andf(f(−g(x))). Since f(−x) =\n−f(x)andf(g(−x)) =f(g(x)), we can conclude that:\nf(f(g(−x))) = f(f(−g(x)))\n5. Now, let’s find the value of f(f(f(g(−x)))) andf(f(f(−g(x)))). Since\nf(f(−x)) = −f(f(x))andf(f(g(−x))) = f(f(−g(x))), we can conclude that:\nf(f(f(g(−x)))) = −f(f(f(−g(x))))\n6. Finally, let’s find the value of f(f(f(f(g(−x))))) andf(f(f(f(−g(x))))) .\nSince f(f(−x)) = −f(f(x))andf(f(f(g(−x)))) = −f(f(f(−g(x)))), we can\nconclude that:\nf(f(f(f(g(−x)))))) = −f(f(f(f(−g(x)))))\nTherefore, the final answer is odd .\nThe answer is: odd.\nWizardMath-13B\n1. We know that f(x)is an odd function, which means that f(−x) =−f(x).\n2. We also know that g(x)is an even function, which means that g(−x) =g(x).\nNow, let’s analyze the given expression: f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) .\n3. Replace xwith −xin the expression: f(f(g(f(g(f(−x)))))) . Since fis odd,\nwe have f(−x) =−f(x), so the expression becomes −f(f(g(f(g(−x))))) .\n4. Since gis even, we have g(−x) =g(x). So, we can rewrite the expression as\n−f(f(g(f(g(x))))) .\n5. Now, we have another instance of fandg. Since fis odd and gis even, their\nproduct is an odd function. So, we can rewrite the expression as −[f(g(f(x)))].\n6. We have another instance of fandg. Since fis odd and gis even, their product\nis an odd function. So, we can rewrite the expression as −f(g(f(x))).\n7. Now, we have another instance of f. Since fis odd, we have f(−x) =−f(x).\nSo, we can rewrite the expression as −f(f(x)).\n8. Finally, we have another instance of f. Since fis odd, we have f(−x) =−f(x).\nSo, we can rewrite the expression as −f(f(x)).\nNow, we can see that the expression is equal to −f(f(x)), which is an odd function.\nTherefore, the answer is odd .\nThe answer is: odd.\nWizardMath-70B\n1. We are given that f(x)is an odd function and g(x)is an even function.\n2. Recall the definitions of odd and even functions:\n- A function f(x)is odd if f(−x) =−f(x)for all xin its domain.\n- A function g(x)is even if g(−x) =g(x)for all xin its domain.\n3. Now, let’s analyze the given function: f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) .\n4. We can rewrite this function as: f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) = h(x), where h(x) =\nf(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) .\n5. Now, let’s find h(−x):\n27-h(−x) =f(f(g(f(g(f(−x)))))) .\n6. Since g(x)is even, we have g(−x) =g(x). So, we can rewrite the expression as:\n-h(−x) =f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) .\n7. Now, we can see that h(−x) =h(x). This means that the function h(x)satisfies\nthe definition of an even function.\n8. Therefore, the given function f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) is even .\nThe answer is: even.\n28\n"}]

After one commercial in which Kiara play-acted as Karan, going around asking people if they’re dating, a new spot shows Karan channeling his inner Rajinikanth. In the ad, Karan and Kiara are both dressed like a quintessential Rajinikanth character, wearing shirts, vests, and aviator sunglasses.\\nKaran seems to be having the time of his life delivering the broad performance. One of the most recognisable filmmakers of the country, Karan made a full-fledged acting debut with Anurag Kashyap’s ill-fated 2015 gangster drama Bombay Velvet. He has since joked multiple times about how the movie’s critical and commercial failure killed his acting ambitions. In the new ad, Karan adopts ‘the south Indian superstar look’, and immediately transforms into a dialogue-delivering, scenery chewing showboat.\\nAlso read – After Dharma creative head’s criticism of Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Karan Johar praises 12th Fail: ‘Passed the test with flying colours’\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n“Ngl, the actor within me is so impressed,” he wrote in the caption of his Instagram post, sharing the new commercial. “Wooohooo superb,” wrote actor Nandish Sandhu in the comments section. “Woww awesome,” another person commented. Last year, Karan collaborated with Lenskart for a series of ads featuring founder Peyush Bansal. The ads were conceptualised by Tanmay Bhat, Devaiah Bopanna, Deep Joshi, and Vishal Dayama.\\nKaran and Kiara have worked together on Lust Stories, Good Newwz, and Shershaah.

He said in an interview that he is biased towards his old friend Shah Rukh, as he described his ‘irreplaceable’ personality. Shah Rukh delivered the three biggest hits of his career in the same calendar year in 2023, reclaiming his position as the country’s biggest star.\\nKaran has often spoken about the kind of allure that movie stars used to have, and told Forbes that he finds this quality lacking in the actors that have followed. He said, “There is no concept, according to me, of superstardom post the era of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. I feel now there’ll be the age of the actors.”\\nAlso read – After Dharma creative head’s criticism of Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Karan Johar praises 12th Fail: ‘Passed the test with flying colours’\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nKaran said that the idea of celebrity has also evolved, because there are so many different ways in which one can become popular these days. “At one point, celebrity meant a movie star or cricketer. But today, a celebrity can be an Instagrammer or a food vlogger, a fashion influencer or a great author. The lines have blurred. But the nation’s crazy love for Shah Rukh, Salman Aamir, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn… Even Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji, Kajol… When Rani and Kajol came on Koffee with Karan, I could tell the equity they carried because they come from a legacy of 25 years.”\\nKaran added, “Even now, when Rekha walks into an event, heads turn. That’s a movie star. When Aishwarya walks the red carpet at Cannes, when Mr Bachchan is anywhere, they’re movie stars. That mania, that magic is very tough to create in this generation of noise.” Highlighting Shah Rukh, Karan declared, “I don’t think there’s a better conversationalist, a more intelligent mind, a more charming and arresting persona, and an aura that is inexplicable than Shah Rukh Khan. That majestic magnetism only he has. He’s irreplaceable.”\\nKaran said that there will be ‘many actors’ in the future, but ‘there never was and never will be a personality like Shah Rukh Khan’. Karan and Shah Rukh have worked together on films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and My Name is Khan.\\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

On the other hand, Varun has kept a low profile and hasn’t spoken much on the matter. Currently gearing up for his OTT release Karmma Calling with Raveena Tandon, Varun was questioned about how he handles moving on from situations in life and whether it’s easy for him.\\nIn an interview with Siddharth Kanna, Varun was asked about moving on. He said, “I think moving on is a bit difficult. But I can forgive thinking that what happened might have been destined. You can’t feel bad about ‘Oh, this happened to me.’ If something bad has happened to you, then leave it to fate and karma.”\\nHe continued, “I think I am naive but I am not street smart is not right, because I am. Being an outsider, I have figured out things on my own. But yes, I am naive; I believe people easily. For me, everybody is a nice person. If I am meeting someone for the first time, I would like to believe that they are a good person.”\\n  View this post on Instagram\\n  A post shared by Divya AmarSanjay Agarwal (@divyaagarwal_official)\\nDivya had revealed the reason behind their break-up on Amrita Rao and RJ Anmol’s podcast. She said, “With Varun, I felt all over the place. With Apurva, I would feel calm and mature. I made Varun meet Apurva. I told him clearly that I had a problem. I had a confusion. Whatever has happened is very wrong and it has happened because of me. I need to put a stop somewhere. And that’s why it was an abrupt break-up. I just got the car to a screeching halt.” The couple announced their break-up in March 2022. Divya is now engaged to entrepreneur Apurva Padgaonkar.
