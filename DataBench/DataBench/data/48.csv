Oxford ends ties with TCS iON over technical glitches,"On April 10, 2023 TCS had announced that it had been selected by Oxford University for the delivery of most of the university’s admissions tests from 2023 onwards.","Less than a year after the Oxford University signed a contract with the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) iON to oversee the Oxford admissions test, the varsity has decided to terminate its deal with the company.
“Following the technical problems experienced by some candidates undertaking Oxford’s online admissions tests in 2023, as well as their schools, colleges and other test centres, we have undertaken a detailed review of the issues to understand better how and why these occurred and taken on board the expert and valuable feedback shared. Our Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Education, Professor Martin Williams has recently written to all test centres to communicate our decision to end our relationship with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS),” an official statement from the UK-based varsity stated.
The pro vice chancellor assured all affiliated schools and colleges that the varsity will do “utmost to streamline the process and ensure that the burden on teachers and exams officers is minimised as far as practically possible,” he said in a letter addressed to all affiliated teachers and exams officers.

On April 10, 2023 TCS had announced that it had been selected by Oxford University for the delivery of most of the university’s admissions tests from 2023 onwards.
However, in October several candidates took to ‘X’ (formerly known as Twitter) to complain about technical glitches during their admission tests. Candidates reported frozen screens, server crashes and more.
We look forward to a written apology and statement about the progress of the tests today. Not only with technical errors, but also the error on the ELAT. Students have prepared for these for months, so rapid response is necessary to assure them they will not be disadvantaged. https://t.co/Afw2NRPlf0

“How will the admissions process go ahead from this? I freezed after 20 minutes and was forced to stare at my screen for another 3 HOURS whilst other students froze 2 hours in but had another hour to CHECK their answers and DISCUSS answers with fellow students,” an X user, David John, posted.
“What is going to happen to those who did the elat when there was an error in the question leaving many students who didn’t know at a disadvantage,” another X user, Emma, posted.
Preparation is irrelevant if the paper won't launch or keeps freezing. And not even a working hotline number to call for assistance on the day! Very poor.

Following this, local media also reported that the Oxford University decided to not use results from its botched online admissions tests to award places on next year’s English courses.
Additionally, Balliol College of Oxford University also posted an official statement about the technical glitches faced by students, especially in ELAT, CAT and MAT tests.
“We understand the difficulty and disappointment some of our applicants will have experienced through technical problems with their online tests this year. Schools and test centres have been asked to let us know via the Special considerations form if something affected their student/s performance during their Oxford admissions test. Some tests were affected more than others, and we understand that applicants who took or were due to take the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) or the Classics Aptitude Test (CAT) should have received an official statement from the University relating to steps taken to ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged by the difficulties encountered,” the official statement read.
The university is now working on alternative options for 2024.

"‘With flexibility, access to maths and science courses, engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad’","Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter).","— Chetan D. Pahlajani
It’s the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) season, and so amidst the anxiety and anticipation capping years of hard work, you possibly find yourself wondering: “If I can make it to one of my preferred IITs, which BTech programme should I choose?” You look up the top choices: “Okay, Computer Science, then. But I think Mechanical or Electrical Engineering may be much broader. What about Chemical or Civil?” There’s input from friends and family, which might not all of is necessarily helpful. And then, perhaps, you love the sciences, but are ambivalent about engineering, and wonder: “Is engineering even the right choice for me? Perhaps I might be better off pursuing an Integrated MSc in the physical sciences.”
These are difficult questions with no easy answers, and so, when the time comes, one will have to make an important life decision with incomplete information. The good news is that very often, one’s academic and professional trajectory and eventual success may not depend so much on making the perfect choice, but simply on making a good enough choice. Part of the reason is that a good BTech programme at many of the IITs is a remarkably good springboard for a variety of career paths, as is evident from the biographies of numerous distinguished IIT alumni.

However, I want to turn my attention to the last group of students mentioned above, passionate about science but unsure about engineering. I too once belonged to that group, and following conventional wisdom at the time, chose engineering (though not at an IIT). What followed were a few not-so-happy years, but I fortunately had the opportunity to take several advanced Mathematics courses, and secured admission to a PhD programme in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote my doctoral thesis in Probability Theory guided by an advisor who, interestingly enough, had also started as a student in Electrical Engineering and then switched to a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I got a postdoctoral position, worked in the US for a few years, joined IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) in 2014, and lived happily ever after. More or less…
Anyway, back to you and your predicament. Well, one thing I have learned over the years is just how versatile an engineering degree can be, provided one can also take courses in one’s area of interest, whatever that may be. This brings me back to the IITs, specifically IITGN, since it is the only IIT where I have worked. Two big strengths of the BTech programme at IITGN are equipping engineering students with a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and providing students the chance to explore numerous courses outside their major. With Mathematics, all students are required to take a few core courses: single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. Additionally, each engineering department may require their students to take specific courses.
Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter). Further, students who have completed at least four semesters with satisfactory academic performance can also apply for a joint BTech/MSc dual degree, where the additional MSc degree can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We recently had a BTech student from Mechanical Engineering take this route, also completing an MSc in Mathematics in the process. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Ohio State University.
The take-home message here is that with a bit of flexibility and access to Mathematics and Science courses, an Engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad for pursuing higher education and a career in these fields. Besides academics, Mathematics PhDs have found careers in Quantitative Finance, and more recently, in Data Science. And so, if you think your dream is to study the Navier-Stokes equations or Algebraic Geometry or Particle Physics or Neuroscience — but you’re not yet sure — a good BTech programme might not be a bad place to start.

The court noted that the counsels for the state and the board submitted that administrative measures for providing logistical support for the examination, in which several lakh students will appear, are complete.
Justice Biswajit Basu said any disturbance to the said situation may cause a serious impact on the examination process. He said for this reason, this court was refraining from interfering with the rescheduling.
The court directed the board and the state to ensure that students do not face any difficulties.
The court ordered the board to open an adequate number of helplines for examinees in all districts. It said if any student faces difficulty in reaching the examination centre, the board will take measures to ensure that the student reaches the centre on time.
The court directed the board to file a compliance report on next Wednesday.

The day will be celebrated with several events such as ‘High level dialogue on learning for lasting peace’ at UNHQ (New York), a festival on the lines of ‘Learning to take care of oneself, others and the planet’, and much more.
Why is it celebrated on January 24?
In 2018, January 24 was declared as the International Day of Education by a resolution that was passed by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on December 3, 2018. Following this, the first International Day of Education was observed on January 24, 2019.
Read | International Education Day 2024: Indian students need to work on soft skills, say experts
Since then, January 24 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Education. The 2024 celebration is the sixth year of celebration.
Understanding this year’s theme
The theme of the 2024 celebrations is ‘learning for lasting peace’. The thought behind this theme has been explained by the UNESCO as: the world is seeing a surge of violent conflicts paralleled by an alarming rise of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and hate speech. The impact of this violence transcends any boundary based on geography, gender, race, religion, politics, offline and online. An active commitment to peace is more urgent today than ever: Education is central to this endeavor, as underlined by the UNESCO Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development. Learning for peace must be transformative, and help empower learners with the necessary knowledge, values, attitudes and skills and behaviours to become agents of peace in their communities.
“The accelerated spread of hate speech is a threat to all communities. Our best defense is education, which must be at the heart of any peace efforts. It is our collective duty to empower learners of all ages to deconstruct hate speech, and lay the foundations for inclusive, democratic and human-rights respecting societies. To succeed, we need to better train and support teachers who are on the front lines in overcoming this phenomenon,” Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General said.
Keeping this in mind, UNESCO is dedicating this year’s celebrations to the crucial role education and teachers play in countering hate speech, which has seen an increase in recent years due to the emergence of social media.
On January 24, UNESCO will organise a one-day online training for several thousand teachers from around the world on the deconstruction of hate speech, which will give them the tools to spot, tackle and prevent hate speech incidents.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/international-education-day-2024-celebrated-on-january-24-theme-9121972/,education

"JEE Main v/s NEET UG: Check main differences in subject preparation, important chapters",Understanding the nuances and aligning study approaches with the specific exam requirements are crucial for aspirants aiming to excel in either of these competitive examinations.,"— Nabin Kaarki
The journey toward success in competitive exams like NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) and JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) is marked by rigorous preparation. Both exams — NEET for medical aspirants and JEE for engineering — demand meticulous planning and a structured approach. However, the strategies for subject-specific preparation in these exams have unique subtleties that are crucial for aspirants looking to succeed in these challenging tests.
Biology vs. Mathematics
NEET aspirants prioritise Biology, a substantial section of the exam (50 per cent), focusing on comprehensive understanding, memorisation, and interpretation of biological concepts, complemented by extensive reading of NCERT books. In contrast, JEE applicants delve deeply into mathematics, emphasising problem-solving skills and a profound understanding of complex mathematical concepts through various resources.

"‘IIT Madras gave me confidence, taught me socialising,’ shares BTech student | Life in an IIT","JEE Main 2024: The 19-year old BTech second-year student says his parents have always been an inspiration. His mother is a doctor and a lecturer in a government college at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, and his father works in the Income Tax Department.","– Sasank Marthand
I was pretty good in mathematics and therefore in Class 9, I decided to choose the science stream. In Class 11 itself, I started preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination. I chose to be an engineer as I was always interested in problem-solving skills. I found a connection with it. Moreover, great CEOs like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella were engineers. I am deeply motivated by them. 
After cracking JEE Advanced 2022, I got admission to BTech in Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. I chose this programme over branches like data science and electronics and communications engineering at the top NITs as civil engineering fascinated me more. I am glad that my hard work and motivation bore fruit and I am currently studying at the best engineering college in India.
I had attended a coaching in my home town Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh but most of the preparation was done by myself.

Life at IIT Madras: From homesickness to finding hidden talents in me
As I completed my entire schooling in my hometown, it was for the first time I was living away from my family. I was worried about how I would cope in a new place. I used to frequently fell sick in my first semester and had a difficult time not having home-cooked food. Since the institute has various choices in its menus, I slowly started adjusting here. However, it was friends and seniors who made me feel like IIT Madras is my second home.

Even though I was reluctant to socialise at first, they all cooperated with me. In the first few days, it felt like I was still in my JEE days due to the rigorous academic curriculum with many co-curricular and extracurricular activities available beyond my imagination. Now that I settled in, I have discovered my hidden talents and interests and have joined quite a few teams.

Made connections through E-Cell 
I am part of the Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell) of IIT Madras and have made many connections through it. It also boosted my confidence in my abilities and am planning to continue to work with the team in the future.

I have also been a part of the game development team of IIT Madras called Envisage. This club is my favourite as I have been interested in gaming since my school days.

I am also in the cultural team and met one of my favourite celebrities, Suma Kanakala (Indian actress and television presenter), last year as I was on the event’s organising team. We interviewed her in ‘Saarang Spotlight’. Saarang is the annual social and cultural festival of IIT Madras. I still boast about it to this day. I met singer Karthik as well during the festival. I am also a part of the civil engineering association where I deal with sponsorships.

IIT Madras: Confidence booster, exposure provider
I believe that getting into an IIT and that too in the NIRF (government ranking) 1 has boosted my confidence greatly and also helped me learn how to socialise and deal with deadlines while coordinating in a team. Living here in the institute has transformed me as a person as I have gotten exposure to various perspectives and now have a better understanding of the world.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the beginning, I only concentrated on attending my classes, but slowly it changed to including at least one extra-curricular activity in my schedule every day. 
I generally hang out with my friends in one of our hostel rooms or near the Usha Cafe inside the campus. Center for Innovation (CFI) is also my hangout place where I along with my friends work on projects. We also go to CCDs to get midnight coffee.
My future aspirations
I plan on getting into a management or technical consultancy in the civil engineering department itself. I am also planning on pursuing higher education like a PhD or an MBA in the later stages of my life.
My ultimate goal is to do something meaningful that is in sync with my interests. For now, my sole focus is on what I am doing at present.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/jee-main-2024-iit-madras-taught-socialise-confident-shares-btech-student-life-in-an-iit-9118645/,education

"Study Abroad | New student in the UK? Stay warm, happy and solvent","Study Abroad: Brighton have a website called ‘next door’, where people post their needs and sometimes comments on work they have had from skilled people like care in the home, or garden.","– Max Martin
As an international student in the UK, you are following the path that Gandhiji, Nehru and Ambedkar took for their higher studies. You will be entering a new world of freedom, opportunities and a fair bit of confusion, as their life stories tell us. You may find the country cold and bleak at times, and expensive almost always. Perhaps, it’s these factors that drove a lot of people to sail across stormy seas to live in our tropical countries happily for many years. Let it be a research topic for you.
So it is good to have a survival plan and a firefighting toolkit right when you book your expensive tickets. The mantra is – plan in advance. Always. Right from finding your accommodation to exploring ways to moonlight for some extra cash and then figuring out ways to splash all those ill-gotten gains in pursuits of fun. Jokes apart, you can usually work part-time – please see your visa.
Roti, kapda, aur makkan
Let us take care of the weather part first. The trick to ensure that you have enough roti, kapda and makkan to survive it while not breaking the bank. Starting with the makkan or accommodation part — be very sure about where you are going to stay and what kind of place it is. You cannot couch surf with friends indefinitely or sleep under a tree even for a night. These are some of the tropical luxuries you will miss in this cold, wet place with a lot of safety regulations. 
Read | Study Abroad: Here’s list of countries that brought recent changes in study visas
The best bet is university accommodation. Universities (and colleges) usually have their halls of residence on campus. Or they may rent a few flats or houses off campus.  First-years get preference. There are usually long waiting lists. It is wise to book your room right when you are offered admission. Most universities have a housing office and they will give you useful advice. There’ll be lots of you living together on campus, so it is mostly fun. You can make those late trips to the library on sleepless nights, sleep late and still attend classes.
There are also exclusive private halls for students. Your university housing office or students’ union may be able to offer advice on some of the popular ones. There may be student Facebook groups, or you can simply do your online search. It is advisable to double-check with (former) students or your campus housing office. Ensure the credibility of the party before making payments.
You can also rent a flat or a room by yourself, but most students share accommodation. That is way cheaper and more fun. Then there are local social network groups that connect you to houses and flat-shares. Most students move into houses with their mates after the first year, so they may need more people to fill a house. Usually, such private renting might need a local guarantor and a month’s rent or more as a deposit. So networking and planning are important.

Most private accommodation includes heating, WiFi, and electricity included in the rent. Or there will be some extra. Avoid nasty surprises anyway, and ensure that the place has decent heating. Otherwise, it will be very uncomfortable during the winter, and you may even fall ill. 
When you move in you will need essentials like bed, blankets, utensils and cutlery – check what is provided as part of the deal. Consider visiting the nearest supermarket and look for an inexpensive range. You won’t need bone China and silver. Sometimes student union shops sell or give away used utensils and household items. Keep an eye.
Stay warm
The weather can be unpredictable. When you go out it can be comfortably warm, breezy, chilly and rainy in turns or all at the same time. Carry multiple layers of clothing with a waterproof on top. Generally, the trick is to have a base layer, a mid-layer and a top layer. You can mix, match, add and subtract layers. Everything goes most of the time. Nobody dresses up in sharp formals except when someone is getting married or mourned for. Unless you are a dude in some fancy business school. Ceremonies like graduation might require a suit – that you can borrow, rent or get from an inexpensive supermarket with a “sale” mark. (I took my dad’s.)  Even better, spot a good charity shop for used or excess stock. It is often considered fashionable and even woke to wear used clothes.

In the winter, however, you will need good shoes, warm socks, gloves, caps, scarves and a good overcoat to stay warm. Decathlon is a good chain to find inexpensive clothes for all seasons. Sports Direct is another.  If you live in a place where it snows or there is sleet on the streets, it may be good to invest in waterproof shoes with a good grip. The same goes if you are into trail running. e
Eat well
Then eat well and drink responsibly. In cold weather, you will feel hungry quite often. Keep fruits, nuts and some cookies and chocolates. Have some hot chocolate or herbal tea. It might be good to carry a lunch box, a water bottle and a thermos while going out – it will save you money on snacks and drinks. I had a friend who took her breakfast, lunch and dinner to campus in a shopping bag. She has a good job and a suburban flat now. Anyway, avoid cheap junk food like cheesy burgers that can make you overweight. 
It is always cheaper to cook your food. Get a student cookbook – or find tips on the Internet. Caution: fried-chilli smoke can choke and chase away European colleagues, and trigger the fire alarm. Wet mixes reduce smoke. Sandwiches are great – that is a staple with a drink and some crisps (our chips, and chips here are like French fries) thrown in. Get or bake full-grain loaves and fill in healthy stuff, even leftovers. Fresh vegetables and fruits can be mysteriously expensive –  have them anyway.  Five (portions) a day, as they say.

Be happy
Tea is consumed religiously. When in doubt they all go and make a cup of tea. It builds friendships, relieves tension, and keeps you warm. Beer is yet another religion – especially on weekends. Generally, it helps bonding and loosens tongues. You can see 18-year-olds drinking for the first time sloshed on streets on weekends. Try not to get plastered. Moderation is the other British mantra – one that is routinely broken on weekends. 
ADVERTISEMENT
It is very important to have a healthy social life. And a lot of fun – long walks, biking, hobby groups, birdwatching, swimming, sailing, dancing, body building. Bikes are always stolen, by the way. So invest in a good D-lock and tie it to something solid like an institution. Do carry a helmet and use bike lamps.
There is a student/youth card for train travel in Britain. You can travel and see the beautiful country.

No one would readily take a new friend home. It takes a bit of time. Then if you are a guest, you will be treated with respect. The local food is generally low on spices as you find in roasts, casseroles, English breakfast (sausages, eggs etc.) and the ubiquitous fish and chips. Make sure you don’t insult the host by topping your roast with a lot of sauces and chilli powder. Curry is a proclaimed national food. If you know how to conjure up a decent curry, you might become a local hero.  Go easy on spices, though.

Welcome to our cold and wet island
Margaret Rey

Maybe I could just add a couple of helpful points for newcomers to this cold and now wet island. 
Find a cheapish supermarket. Lidl and Aldi are both good. If you have a Tesco or other major supermarket nearby, check to see if there is a club membership (free) to access offers. At the end of the afternoon or early evening, many supermarkets reduce the price of food items rather than waste them so this is a good time to shop. 
Nearly all the parks are free and good for exercise and company. There are often walking or running groups that meet regularly that you could investigate if interested.

Take vitamin D both in winter and summer. You can buy it cheaply from a supermarket or Superdrug or Savers. Important especially for non-white skin but many native people like us take it anyway! (Maybe check with your pharmacist first – editor) 
Use charity shops (Eg. Oxfam, Red Cross) for household items, clothes etc. There are lots in most towns that you can browse in. If you have time to volunteer, you’ll get support and make friends and discover lots about all sorts of different people.
British people tend to use words like ‘please’, ‘thank you’ and even ‘sorry’ quite a lot. It usually goes down well! 
If you have an affiliation to a religion, you could make friends and meet people who might well be on your wavelength. You will usually be made very welcome.

If you meet with any unpleasantness or racism, don’t absorb the hurt. It’s against the law to make racist comments. Seek advice from friends or even the police as to how to act. I advised my daughter to ask the offender to repeat what was said, which usually embarrasses and confuses and helps to make them realise the seriousness of the comment. 
Libraries are an amazing place to be. Nowadays, for instance, our main Brighton library is used for groups to meet, children to sing, newspapers to read, and a cafe to sit in amongst other things like an international women’s network that meets each Wednesday. 
I forgot to say that we in Brighton have a website called ‘next door’, where people post their needs and sometimes comment on work they have had from skilled people like care in the home or garden. I expect other towns to have something similar.

Provide study material in Indian languages digitally within 3 years: Govt to educational institutions,The statement added that studying in one's own language can provide a student the natural space to think innovatively without any language barrier.,"The Centre has directed schools and higher education institutions to provide study material for all courses in Indian languages digitally within the next three years, officials said on Friday.

“UGC, AICTE and the Department of School Education have also been asked to take up the issue with regard to state schools and universities,” the Ministry of Education (MoE) said in a statement. “The above directions have emerged from the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) for promoting multilingualism in education at every level, so that students get the opportunity to study in their own language, and can have better learning outcomes,” it said.

Studying in one’s own language can provide a student the natural space to think innovatively without any language barrier, it added.
According to the MoE, NEP 2020 strongly conveys the idea that multilingual nature of Bharat is its huge asset and strength which needs to be utilised efficiently for its socio-cultural, economic and educational development. “Content creation in local languages will boost this multilingual asset and pave way for its better contribution to ‘Viksit Bharat’ to make our country as developed nation by 2047.
“The government has already been working in this direction during the past two years, with translation of Engineering, Medical, Law, UG, PG and Skill books being done through the Anuvadini AI based App,” the ministry said.

A Lesson from IIT | Why should Indians head to IIT Zanzibar?,"'The exalted status enjoyed for long years by the IITs in India creates huge pressures both inside the institutions and outside in society,' says Preeti Aghalayam.","— Preeti Aghalayam

Vikram: “No, Jatin. I also love to cook and help maa in the kitchen. These are gender stereotypes that suggest only women should cook. Cooking is a basic life skill and can be pursued as a hobby or profession both by men and women.”

Teacher: “It is a common misconception that cricket can be played by men only. This is a kind of gender discrimination..”

Why? Unfair exam assessment, the students alleged.
This is not the first time that Indian students have received a failing grade in one specific subject taught by one specific professor, Algoma University students have alleged. “This is a money-making technique. They know that students will get scared and will have to reappear for that subject, which means they will have to pay an additional exam or semester fee.

IITs Placements: IITs build consensus on not declaring top pay packages in placement report,IIT-Bombay revises Rs 1 cr-plus offer count from 85 to 22,"In view of “pressure” on students during placement season, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are considering not disclosing the highest annual packages in their placement reports, focussing on mean and median salary figures instead, The Indian Express has learnt.
This consensus emerged during a recent meeting of the All IITs Placement Committee (AIPC), where discussions included the IIT-Bombay placement report from last week which claimed over 85 offers surpassing an annual package of Rs 1 crore. In a corrigendum issued on Wednesday, IIT-Bombay, while citing a “technical error”, revised the number of Rs 1 crore-plus offers in the first phase of placement to 22.

Jharkhand launches programme to increase attendance in schools,"'Blow whistle' campaign launched recently in villages surrounding the school evoked a good response as students, who were absent for almost a month have started attending school as soon as they hear the whistle sound.","In an attempt to bring back students skipping classes for over a month, the Department of School Education and Literacy of Jharkhand has launched a unique programme ‘Prayas -Siti bajao, school bulao’ (blow whistle, call students to school).
A government school in Tangrain, about 45 km from here, in Potka block of East Singhbhum district has implemented ‘Siti bajao, Upsthithi badao’ (blow whistle, increase attendance) in line with the government programme a couple of days ago and the response was good.
‘Blow whistle’ campaign launched recently in villages surrounding the school evoked a good response as students, who were absent for almost a month have started attending school as soon as they hear the whistle sound, said Headmaster-in-Charge Arvind Tiwary of Tangrain Upgraded Middle School.
Considering the constructive response of the programme, the education and literacy department decided to launch it in all government schools across the state and directed the concerned authorities to upload the pictures of students blowing whistle on social media with hashtag #seetibajao on January 11 as soon as students arrive in the school in the morning, he said.
“We are targeting those students, who skipped classes continuously for about a month”, Tiwary, who had implemented innovative ideas in the past to motivate students to attend classes, told PTI.
“We have divided students into groups and picked up group leaders based on their answers to questions such as name of rivers/famous personality etc”, he said, adding that a member of the school management committee and a teacher along with the group leader mark a zero against student who failed to attend classes for one/two days, two zeros against students absent for about a month and three zeros against those, who failed to turn up for over a month.
“Our main target is to bring back the students of the last two categories and to achieve the target we have launched the drive ‘siti bajao, upsthithi badao’ (blow whistle, increase attendance) in line with the government’s proposed programme blow whistle, call students”, he said.

"ICAI Final Results: ‘My CA sisters inspired me to take up this course,’ says (AIR 3) Tikendra Kumar Singhal",ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: 22-year-old Tikendra wishes to now join a consultancy firm and kickstart his career. He has earlier worked in a Jaipur-based CA firm as a part of his articleship.,"ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: This year, two 22-year-old boys from Jaipur, have bagged the All India Rank (AIR) 3 in the ICAI CA Final November 2023 results. One of them is Tikendra Kumar Singhal who scored 590 marks (73.75 per cent).
Singhal was in Class 7 or 8 when his oldest sister, who cleared CA 5-6 years ago, decided to pursue Chartered Accountancy, and that was when Tikendra also got to know about this profession. Since then, Tikendra made up his mind that he would like to pursue it after graduating high school. The Singhal family now has three CAs in the house — the oldest daughter cleared the CA final 5-6 years ago, the second daughter became a CA about three years ago, and the latest addition is Tikendra.
“My sisters were not only my inspiration but also my guides and support system. My siblings helped me when it came to clearing my doubts and also kept motivating me throughout my 4-5 years of the journey,” he told indianexpress.com.

‘Offline classes help you stay focused’
The 22-year-old boy started preparing for CA in November 2019 through offline classes, and a few months later had to shift to online classes as the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the world came under a complete lockdown. While the online classes seemed more convenient to Tikendra, he still prefers the offline version. “The comfort of having one-on-one discussions with teachers in offline classes is no short of a luxury. You get an opportunity to clear your doubts in the class itself. Shifting to online classes was difficult initially as it was not easy to get the same level of concentration and discipline. A lot of time we end up playing the recorded classes (in the online version) at 1.5x speed, which looks more convenient at that moment but isn’t as effective in the long run,” he explained.
Tikendra also believes that it is important to enrol in coaching classes for the CA journey to ensure your basics are clear. “There will always be some topics in every subject that a teacher would be able to explain better. So, coaching classes are important to get those concepts right. Other than that, students should also listen to their teachers and learn from their experiences,” he said.
The AIR 3 used to study 9-10 hours every day in the last few months of the CA journey, but a month before the exam, he extended his study hours to 12-13 hours per day. Tikendra believes the secret to achieving success in this journey is staying consistent, determined and disciplined.

“Staying consistent and disciplined in your preparation strategy is very important. Giving a few hours every day to CA preparation will help you stay focused, and in sync with your schedule and will also help you remember all the important concepts and basics. The biggest advantage of this will be that when the final moments arrive, you won’t be anxious and scared. The final moments before the exam will not feel overwhelming and consistency will help you with confidence by taking away the chaos,” he explained.
New CA syllabus: Need of the hour
In a world where people look for shortcuts for success, Tikendra believes that the revision of the CA syllabus by ICAI is best for all CA aspirants. Tikendra feels that the ICAI CA syllabus was more about rote learning till now, but the new syllabus will help students understand the basics more.
“The new syllabus is a good move as it concentrates more on application-based learning, rather than rote learning. Since it is majorly MCQ-based now, students will have to understand the concept, rather than just learning the steps of questions. This will surely give more weightage to actual understanding of concepts, and that was the need of the hour,” he explained.

He also added that he relied majorly on the ICAI study material as it concentrated on the main topics, which were explained more thoroughly.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-final-results-my-ca-sisters-inspired-me-to-take-up-this-course-says-air-3-tikendra-kumar-singhal-9101344/,education

"ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: ‘It gets frustrating, but keep going,’ AIR 1 Madhur Jain shines in a family of CAs","ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: Madhur Jain, 22, started preparing in 2019 and used to study for 8-10 hours initially, before extending it to 12-13 hours as the exam approached.","ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: Madhur Jain, a 22-year-old from Jaipur, is not the first Chartered Accountant (CA) in his family, but he is the first to bag an All India Rank (AIR) 1.
“I have 5-6 CAs in my family, including my sibling who is three years older than me and bagged AIR 6 in his attempt. So having all of them around me helped me stay calm and focused. My paternal uncle, who is in the same field, also helped me stay motivated,” he told indianexpress.com.
Madhur added that having so many CAs in the family helped him skip the research part of pre-preparation time. When it came to which books to refer to, which classes to enrol for, which teachers to take advise from, etc, Madhur had smooth sailing as his cousins had already researched all that before.
READ | ICAI CA Final Results 2023
Madhur scored 619 (77.8 per cent) in his first attempt, which helped him bag AIR 1.
‘Tough to memorise everything, revisions important’
The Jaipur boy started preparing in 2019 and used to study eight to 10 hours every day when he started his CA journey, but as the CA Final exam date approached, he increased the study time to 12-13 hours each day. What posed a problem for Madhur was the vast syllabus.
“The CA syllabus is so vast that it gets frustrating. By the time you are done with your coaching classes, everything gets wiped from your memory because it is nearly impossible to remember such a vast syllabus. To overcome this problem, I did at least three rounds of revisions for most subjects but four rounds for ‘Cost and Management Accounting’ and ‘Audit’. The first two rounds of revisions helped me brush up on what I had studied in the coaching classes and the third round helped me retain the important concepts,” he said.
Madhur added that he was scared and not confident about his preparation till a week before the examination, when he realised that he was able to retain the concepts he had prepared, and became confident that he would be able to ace the CA Final exam in November 2023.

Unlike many other CA students, Madhur does not support the idea of self-written notes, and believes that writing notes is not the most efficient way of using limited time. Instead, he believes in understanding the concepts in such a way that you are able to retain everything in your memory.

‘Always have a hobby to refresh your mind’
When Madhur used to get frustrated and overwhelmed due to the long study hours, he would turn to his sibling and cousins for a fun cricket session. “I used to go and play cricket with my cousins and sibling whenever I got too frustrated by studying. One game of cricket used to freshen me up and help me reset completely. So I think having a hobby or any activity that you like doing to relax is very important when preparing for CA, otherwise the journey can frustrate you,” he advised future aspirants.

Even though Madhur is not on any social media platform, he believes that maintaining a balance on such platforms is essential. “These platforms can get distracting for sure but if it helps you relax then you should engage in it, but make sure you maintain the balance,” he said.
He also advises students to remember that there is no easy way to become a CA. “Hard work and determination are essential for a successful CA journey. There is no shortcut to it. You have to stay persistent and even when the tiring schedule frustrates you and you wish to give up, keep going,” he concluded.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-ca-final-november-2023-results-it-gets-frustrating-but-keep-going-air-1-madhur-jain-shines-in-a-family-of-cas-9101778/,education

Twins from Mumbai top ICAI CA Final November 2023 exam,"ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: 'Enjoy the process, keep learning and develop the power of retaining. Even if it feels tedious, remember that the CA journey is worth all the sweat,' Sanskruti and Shruti advised future aspirants.","ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: Sanskruti and Shruti Atul Parolia, 22-year-old twins from Mumbai, have cleared the ICAI CA Final November 2023 with an All India Rank (AIR) 2 and 8 respectively. Sanskruti, who bagged AIR 2, scored 599 marks (74.88 per cent) in the final exam. This was their first attempt at both groups I and II.
Sanskruti and Shruti come from a family of CAs as their father, brother and sister-in-law are all Chartered Accountants (CA). “It was very early on during our schooling years that we realised we wanted to follow our father’s path. And then our brother joined the lineage, followed by our sister-in-law. Having them around influenced our decision to take up this course,” the twins told indianexpress.com.
The Mumbai-based girls ensured they studied together which helped them stay disciplined and focused. “We studied together every day — each subject and topic. This helped us a lot because my sister was there to clear my doubts wherever I got stuck, and vice-versa. It was also a big support because she understood exactly what I was going through in tough times,” Shruti said.
READ | ICAI CA Final Results 2023
Both sisters started preparing in 2019 — a few months before Covid pandemic hit — due to which they participated in offline as well as online classes. While offline classes gave them more discipline, online classes seemed more convenient to them. “It is easier to stay focused and disciplined in offline classes because the teacher is in front of you and you cannot fast forward recorded videos. But the flexibility and comfort that the online classes provided suited us. We had the freedom to watch the recorded lessons even at night, which helped us a lot, especially during our articleship period,” Sanskruti said.
Revisions and ICAI study material most important
Even though they took notes from their teachers, Sanskruti and Shruti relied majorly on the study material provided by ICAI, and the sisters believe that every CA student should study and revise from that material.
They also believe that in addition to focusing on getting basic concepts right, what is important is to ace the CA final revisions. “It is essential to revise multiple times, especially a month before the exam. Remember there is no shortcut to this and every aspirant should schedule their preparation in such a way that they have enough time to conduct repeated revisions,” Shruti said.

“Revisions help you because the syllabus is so vast that you tend to miss out on chapters. So, revising multiple times helps you in remembering those forgotten concepts again, and it also helps you build confidence in your strengths and identify weak spots,” Sanskruti explained.
The twins devoted daily 8-10 hours to studies in the beginning and extended it to 10-12 each day a month before the CA Final exam. “Discipline and balance are the keys to success, and it is important to remember that don’t postpone anything and keep revising,” Shruti passed on the advice for future aspirants.

"ICAI CA Final Nov 2023 Results: ‘I lost father, grandparents in Covid; they are my guiding angels,’ says (AIR 3) Rishi Malhotra","Rishi wanted to pursue medical field but since his parents wanted him to stay in Jaipur, he opted for Commerce. Although he scored 95.4% in Class 12 board exams, he was unable to get a spot in top 3 DU colleges, and decided to pursue his CA dream.","ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: Rishi Malhotra scored 590 (73.75 per cent) in the ICAI CA Final November 2023 exam and bagged the All India Rank (AIR) 3. He has shared this position with another boy from Jaipur, Tikendra Kumar Singhal.
This was Malhotra’s first attempt at the CA Final exam in which he appeared for both groups. When he started preparing for his CA journey in 2019, little did he know that he would have to face so many difficulties. “I lost my father, grandfather and my grandmother to Covid within a week. This was when I was doing my articleship at E&Y, Delhi office. All of this happened so quickly that I had to rush back to Jaipur to be there for my family. Since both my elder sisters are married, I decided to quit E&Y, and got an internship at KPMG, Jaipur,” he shared with indianexpress.com. Rishi still works at the same company.
During the second pandemic wave, the 22-year-old was admitted to the hospital due to Covid. Even though it was difficult for him to bounce back to normalcy, he did not give up hope. “When I started my CA journey in 2019, I wanted to go to one of the top three Delhi University colleges, but since I didn’t get through, I decided to at least bring laurels in Chartered Accountancy. I knew I had to make my family proud, and losing my three beloved family members in the Covid reminded me of my goal. Those three are my guiding angels and it is because of them that I got the strength to achieve this rank today,” he reminisced.

Rishi’s mother currently works as a director at the Pension Office of the Rajasthan Government, and his sisters work at Siemens AG (Pune) and Dell Inc (Bengaluru). The three women gave him strength and support to continue this journey, he added.
ICAI CA Results: Revision and self-notes are important
Even though Rishi took coaching classes during his CA journey, he wrapped up those classes a year before appearing for the Final exam and concentrated on his revision. What helped him the most, he says, is the notes that he prepared on his own.
“I had a target of having only three registers of notes for each attempt. Irrespective of how many books the ICAI has prescribed, I ensured that I maintained only three registers keeping the last day revision in mind. I knew that I wouldn’t have the time to go through so many pages a day before the exam, so I shortened everything. I would write the important concepts, and then under that cut and paste the questions from books, and then write the answer myself. This technique helped me understand and remember concepts and questions properly,” he explained.

Another thing that Rishi believes is important to ace the CA final exam is mock tests and revision. The Jaipur boy claims he solved 4-5 test series repeatedly, which ultimately totalled to nearly 20 revisions in the last year. He ensured that he stayed focused and disciplined when it came to revision.
“Attempting mock tests and doing multiple rounds of revisions helps you understand your strengths and weaknesses. It helps you realise which part of the syllabus and question paper will take more time and which is the part that you can solve quickly. With nearly 20 rounds of revision, I could remember exactly what the page of the book looked like as soon as I saw the question. So, it is important to do multiple revisions on your own if you want clarity on concepts, basics and a good score,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-ca-final-results-i-lost-father-grandparents-in-covid-they-are-my-guiding-angels-says-air-3-rishi-malhotra-9101418/,education

Impact of External Research Funding: A Path Ahead in the Development of Research Universities,External research funding provides capital support for this knowledge cultivation that nourishes economies and societies.,"Research universities are some of the highly concentrated places for scholars, students, and faculty. Their collective expertise fuels the advancement of knowledge through creative ideas, innovation, and discoveries. External research funding provides capital support for this knowledge cultivation that nourishes economies and societies. Institutional growth and development are significantly influenced by external finance.
The sources of external research funding for universities can be divided broadly into following types: Government Agencies (States and the Union), Foundations & Public Charities, and Commercial (Industry and business). A study says government funding contributes the maximum to the overall basket of external research funding and encourages the research ecosystem in the universities. 
External research funding enables universities to implement enhanced management and accountability systems. It helps to upgrade lab facilities and provide research students with cutting-edge tools, machines and processes. Universities get sufficient capital support to implement steps for developing a sustainable research ecosystem.
External research funding encourages creativity and innovations and helps to get patents. A research-focused environment at higher education institutions stimulates structural changes towards building a knowledge-intensive economy and society. It boosts Indian competitiveness on the global platform, fuels the nation’s growth and generates high-quality professionals with power skills like critical thinking, analytical skills, problem-solving and more.
In an exclusive one-to-one chat with Prof. (Dr.) Lalita Ledwani, Dean, Faculty of Science, Manipal University Jaipur, said, “Science, technology and innovations are often seeded in the university environment. It is our mission at Manipal University Jaipur to promote a multi-disciplinary research programme focusing on basic and applied research, technology development and innovation. It is this vision that has helped our university to do exceptionally well in all spheres of science, engineering, humanities and social sciences.”
Prof. (Dr.) Lalita Ledwani continued, “Our internal and external research-funded projects are aimed to boost the number and quality of publications, research grants and award of doctoral degrees. Our Research Promotion Policy strives to foster an excellent research environment at MUJ and implement research policies in accordance with standard norms.” 
Globally, 2% of GDP is considered the ideal benchmark for gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) to maintain the competitive edge. Countries like the USA, Germany, Israel, and South Korea invest over 3% annually to fund research in their universities and institutions. Unfortunately, India has lagged at 0.7% of the GDP in the last two decades. However, this is on the verge of change for the better with the National Research Foundation.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Government of India on 29th June 2023 approved a proposal to establish the National Research Foundation (NRF) as per recommendations of NEP 2020 with an estimated outlay of Rs. 50,000 crores in the next five years (2023-28). This apex body will promote, fund and monitor scientific research in universities and institutions across the country to cultivate the culture of research in Indian higher institutions. NRF is an excellent step towards developing research universities and research ecosystems within existing institutions. 
Prof. (Dr.) Lalita Ledwani said, “External research funding enables academic institutions to carry out research, experiments, and creative projects that support technology advancements, scientific discoveries, and academic progress. With this funding, academic programmes, multidisciplinary initiatives, and curricular improvements that meet changing business and societal demands can be developed. Promising research grants and scholarships draw bright academics, researchers, and students to the university. For advancing research, industry-academic institution partnership can turn scholarly discoveries into real-world applications that improve society and the economy. In the current time, there is need to give more emphasis on applied and cost-effective research projects which can address societal challenges and contribute to solving real-world problems.”
Prof Ledwani further added, “The institution’s standing and visibility are enhanced both inside and beyond the academic community when external financing is obtained, particularly for large-scale research projects or initiatives. This kind of acknowledgment can draw in more talent, collaborations, and financing. Research has always been paramount at Manipal University Jaipur.  We receive numerous grants and funds from government agencies and industry partners. Recently, we bagged a multi-disciplinary prestigious grant of Rs. 10 Crores from the Department of Science and Technology under the Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE) scheme for development and utilization of high value products from waste resources. In order to promote development, innovation, and excellence in higher education institutions, outside funding is essential. It helps these institutions to become more capable, to spearhead research projects, and to offer better learning opportunities that serve society as a whole as well as the academic community. We look forward to leveraging NRF for our research projects.”

India has witnessed a significant boost in external research funding in recent years from government, industry and other sources. The rising number of patents, research papers etc., is a testament to the positive impact of external research funding. According to a Times Higher Education report, India stands third among G20 countries in research outputs. India produced 1.3 million research papers and 8.9 million citations between 2017-22.
Universities are the cradles of the next generation of academic or otherwise scholars. It is where they get trained, research and discover to continue inter-generational growth. External research funding provides tools and resources for research and helps reshape the economy and society with resource-ready research universities.

Over a million students appear for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) every year dream of a shiny BTech degree, preferably in Computer Science, capped by a generous Rs 1.5 crore per annum package at some renowned company. An entire education industry runs on the strength of this dream; success stories of various IITians flood media outlets across the country. Though very appealing, these stories tell only a part of the truth. The IITs are not yellow brick roads with huge pay packages at the end. The reality is that an IIT does not always prepare you for the Rs 1.5 crore per annum package and do not often count such placements as the ultimate success.

Stakeholders appeal to reconsider decision allowing schools to use only JKBOSE-mandated books,"JKBOSE Exams: Union Territory (UT) administration recently refused to entertain examination forms for the students of private schools, which were operating on state land without proper lease documentation","The Jammu and Kashmir Educational Welfare Alliance, an amalgam of stakeholders in the private education sector, on Thursday appealed to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to reconsider the decision of the JK Board of School Education (BOSE) that allows the schools only to use books mandated by the board.
“The decision to exclusively mandate the use of educational materials provided by the JK BOSE has sparked concerns among the stakeholders,” Dr Tauseef Ahmad, an alliance member, told reporters.
“While the objective may be to standardise the educational content, it inadvertently restricts choices available to the students and parents. It potentially hinders the global aspiration of our future generations,” he added.

Dr Ahmad said the New Education Policy (NEP) 2022 underscores the importance of skill-based learning and leveraging the game-based digital and communicative formats to facilitate holistic development of the students.
“We have to think if the books imposed by JK BOSE on private schools are in resonance with the NEP 2020. Also, do these books cater to the curriculum designed under the NEP?” he asked.
Dr Ahmad said the decision puts at stake the future of more than 10,000 families, who are earning their livelihood from book publishing.

The alliance members also raised the issue of tagging of the students of 125 private schools with the government schools recently.

“Army Goodwill Schools operating from state land have been shown leniency. The same view should be adopted in respect of these schools, where more than 2,300 persons are employed,” noted educationist C L Vishen.
He said that the government decision on these schools was against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of ‘Startup India’.
“While all facilities are being provided under Startup India and other self employment schemes with the aim of generating jobs, institutions which have already created jobs are being shut down here,” Vishen added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/stakeholders-appeal-to-reconsider-decision-allowing-schools-to-use-only-jkbose-mandated-books-9096523/,education

NEET UG: Supreme Court rejects plea against signature campaign seeking exam cancellation,The Supreme Court was hearing a petition that had sought direction to the state to not allow such activity in schools there.,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea against the DMK’s signature campaign in Tamil Nadu seeking to abolish the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission in medical colleges across the country.
The apex court was hearing a petition that had sought direction to the state to not allow such activity in schools there.
A bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Viswanathan observed that competitive examinations, which are conducted on a pan-India basis, have to be held.

When the petitioner told the bench that children are distressed though they have to face the examination eventually, Justice Kant observed, “Fortunately, now we have a very informed generation. Our children are not so innocent and now they understand everything”. “They are far ahead of our generation… They understand everything, what is the motive, what is the agenda, how it happens,” Justice Surya Kant said.
The bench, however, declined to entertain the petition. In October last year, the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu had launched a campaign to obtain 50 lakh signatures in 50 days seeking to abolish the NEET.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/neet-ug-2024-supreme-court-rejects-plea-against-signature-campaign-seeking-exam-cancellation-9092035/,education

"Immigration too high in the UK? Change system instead of penalising international students, opine experts, stakeholders","The UK has announced a ban on overseas students bringing their families along, unless they are on PG research degrees. Also, they will no longer be allowed to switch from student visa to work routes until their studies are complete. The changes come into effect in Jan 2024.","“Immigration is too high. Today we’re taking radical action to bring it down,” Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, tweeted on December 4, which sent a wave of worry across groups of Indian students who are already in the UK or aspire to go in the next few years. As Canada and Australia have also been tightening their immigration policies, including for student visas, the UK was not a country that Indians were expecting to hear this line from, especially at a time when the government is being led by someone of Indian heritage.
According to a report published by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) in 2018, there are over 750,000 students who head to the UK to study each year – in higher and further education, in independent and language schools. Some come for short English language courses, others for PhDs at the frontier of scientific research. Since that report, there has been a large rise in the number of student visas issued. The total number of visas issued in 2019 was 404,400, growing to 623,700 in 2022, as per the latest MAC report.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/immigration-too-high-in-uk-change-system-instead-of-penalising-international-students-opine-experts-stakeholders-9088073/,education

"‘Kota Factory’ in 2023: Year of highest student suicides, desperate preventive measures",The spate of student suicides prompted the stakeholders to come up with desperate measures such as installing anti-hanging devices in hostel room fans and iron mesh in balconies and lobbies.,"For Ramesh Kumar (name changed) from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh, 2023 was the worst year of his life. His family is still coming to terms with the loss of their elder son, who killed himself in a hostel room in Rajasthan’s Kota where he had been preparing for the medical entrance exam for the past two years.
Kumar’s son is among 26 coaching students who died by suicide this year in Kota, the highest-ever figure. Last year, the toll was 15.
The spate of student suicides also prompted the stakeholders to come up with desperate measures such as installing anti-hanging devices in hostel room fans and iron mesh in balconies and lobbies.
Mourning the loss of his son, Kumar has decided to bring back his younger son, who had moved to Kota earlier this year and was preparing for the engineering entrance exam JEE.

“They were living in separate hostels as they were enrolled in different coaching institutes. Our plan was that in 2024, my wife would move to Kota and rent a house so the three of them could live together and the children could prepare for the entrance exams in the comfort of home. I had never imagined that my son would not be there by then…,” he said.
“I wanted both my children to study at the best colleges and become doctors and engineers but not at the cost of their lives … We decided to call our younger son back to Bulandshahr and continue with his schooling here. We are not willing to take any further risk,” he added.
ADVERTISEMENT
More than two lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.
Packed schedules, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness are among the common struggles the students contend with in the coaching hub.
The family of Farheed Hussain from West Bengal’s Birbhum district is still looking for answers about what made his son take the extreme step.
ADVERTISEMENT
“He was a very bright student, I wanted him to be a doctor but never pressured him. He used to score well in the routine tests, barring a few … I don’t know why he was compelled to end his life then,” said Hussain, choking on tears.
Seeking desperate measures during a desperate time, the Kota administration and stakeholders of the coaching industry sprung into action and took various steps to prevent student suicides. The year 2024 will be reflective of how efficient these measures prove to be.
From “suicide proofing” fans in hostel rooms to installation of nets in balconies and lobbies to prevent students from ending their lives, restrictions on glorification of toppers to directives for keeping results of routine tests confidential, roping in mess workers and tiffin service providers to flag early signs of stress if a student is not consuming food properly were among the measures taken this year to prevent further deaths.
In 2017, the Kota Hostels’ Association discussed installing spring coils in hostel fans. This device works on the basis that if an object weighing more than 20 kilogrammes is hung from it, the spring attached to it expands, making it impossible for someone to commit suicide. A siren also goes off simultaneously.
But it did not gain popularity with the estimated 25,000 paying guest facilities in the city. However, in August, when the number of suicides hit a record high, the district administration issued an order mandating the installation of anti-hanging devices in hostel room fans.
ADVERTISEMENT
The routine tests conducted by coaching institutes were also suspended by the district administration for more than two months.
Wardens and staff members of hostels in Kota are being given professional training in mess management, psychological and behavioural counselling, and other aspects of students’ care to equip them to battle the rising number of suicides.
ADVERTISEMENT
Three hostel associations in Kota — the Chambal Hostel Association, Coral Hostel Association and the Kota Hostels’ Association — signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Jai Minesh Tribal University in Kota to design special Hostel Management certificate courses for the wardens and the staff members.
While the Kota Police encouraged hostel wardens to participate actively in the “darwaze pe dastak (knock on door)” campaign, the mess workers and tiffin providers were roped in to report if a student is absent from the mess repeatedly and skips meals or anyone’s tiffin is found unconsumed.
ADVERTISEMENT
The city police set up a dedicated student cell to reach out to the competitive exam aspirants and make attempts to detect early signs of stress and depression.
According to officials, the cell comprises 11 police personnel. They were chosen as all are in their 40s and have teenage children that will help them understand the challenges faced by the students.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/kota-factory-2023-highest-student-suicides-preventive-measures-jee-main-neet-ug-2024-9089501/,education

Yearender 2023: How have IITs performed in global rankings this year,"IIT Rankings: A drop in the rankings of IITs doesn't necessarily indicate a reduction in quality, says QS' Senior Vice President Ben Sowter.","Several IITs have improved their overall rankings in the past few years, however, in 2023, a few prominent ones have also seen a significant fall. While some IITs may not have improved their overall global rankings (as per QS rankings), they have managed to climb up in the domestic rankings.
Some of the first generation IITs that have improved their rankings include IIT Bombay. The institute’s position rose to 172 in 2021, but the ranking went down to 177 in 2022. However, IIT-B bounced back to the 172 position in 2023 and then jumped to 149 in 2024 — the best so far.

KVS can’t deny admission under EWS category for certificate issued by another state: HC,The central government has notified the gross annual family income threshold for the purpose of determining EWS category as below Rs 8 lakh.,"The Centre, which controls the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), is the appropriate government for notifying the annual income threshold to decide whether a child belongs to the economically weaker section (EWS), the Delhi High Court has ruled.
It said the KVS cannot deny admission to a student under the EWS category on the ground that the income certificate has been obtained from another state and not from the Delhi government.
Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said the central government has notified that a certificate for that purpose is to be issued by an officer not below the rank of tehsildar in the state, after carefully verifying all relevant documents and following due process as prescribed by the respective state governments.
“This implies that for a candidate applying for admission to a KV school anywhere in the country under the EWS category, they need not furnish a certificate issued from the state government where the school is situated but such certificate is required to be furnished by an officer of the specified rank in the State where such verification is possible,” the high court said.
It added that the central government has notified the gross annual family income threshold for the purpose of determining EWS category as below Rs 8 lakh.
“The ground on which KVS has rejected the petitioner’s ward for admission, viz that the EWS certificate has been obtained from the State of Uttar Pradesh and not from the Government of NCT Delhi, is untenable,” the high court said.
The high court allowed a petition by a man seeking direction to KVS (Delhi region) to grant admission to his son in a Kendriya Vidyalaya in the national capital under the EWS category after quashing the January 3, 2022 communication issued by the authorities declining admission.
ADVERTISEMENT
The petitioner, a native of Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, had initially sought admission for his son in class 1 under the EWS category. He said he moved to Delhi on securing a job and wanted his son to be admitted to a Kendriya Vidyalaya in the national capital. Since significant time was lost during the litigation, the court ordered his admission to class 3.
The EWS certificate was issued to him by a tehsildar in Azamgarh.
The KVS counsel argued that the petitioner’s son was declined admission not only on the ground that the man had produced an income certificate/ EWS certificate from Uttar Pradesh but also because there were other “glaring” irregularities in the application.
ADVERTISEMENT
While allowing the petition, the court said, “Considering that the petitioner’s ward was denied admission despite the initial allotment made for academic session 2021-?2022 in Class I, it is deemed appropriate to mould the relief sought in the present petition, directing KVS to grant regular admission to the petitioner’s ward in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Narela for the academic session 2023-2024 forthwith (in class 3).",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/kvs-cant-deny-admission-under-ews-category-for-certificate-issued-by-another-state-hc-9082148/,education

"Despite increase in suicide cases, Kota faces shortage of clinical psychologists","The Psychological Counselling Centre was started (without any additional budget), however, commencement of M Phil course and appointment of clinical psychologists is still pending there, Dr Daria added.","Despite 26 cases of suicide by coaching students in 2023, the highest in a year, Kota still faces a shortage of clinical psychologists to deal with mental health issues of about 2.50 lakh coaching students preparing for various entrance examinations like JEE, NEET away from their homes.
The Psychological Counselling Centre, set up in September this year in the New Medical College Hospital in Kota in compliance with the state government’s budget announcement, has no clinical psychologist. There is only one clinical psychologist appointed at the NMCH against the demand of at least five, and it lacks an adequate number of trained staff.
Non-availability of M Phil in clinical psychology in medical colleges of the state has further aggravated the issue as those serving in government medical colleges in the state are the degree holders from other states and are short against the demand.

Dr Vinod Kumar Daria, professor (MD), the Department of Psychology at the New Medical College Hospital said that he chalked out a proposal for M Phil course in clinical psychology in government institutions in Rajasthan and forwarded it to the state government in January last year. The proposal was approved leading to announcement of Psychological Counselling Centre with skilled clinical psychologists.
The Psychological Counselling Centre was started (without any additional budget), however, commencement of M Phil course and appointment of clinical psychologists is still pending there, Dr Daria added.
Because of better study culture in Rajasthan, parents from across the country are getting their wards admitted in Rajasthan and a further high inflow of students is expected in Kota, Sikar and Jaipur. Clinical psychologists are in acute demand in the state, Dr Daria said while pointing out that inflow of mental health-related patients in government medical colleges in the state is sufficient enough to start with eight-seat M Phil course in clinical psychology.

Admitting an acute shortage of clinical psychologists and expert counsellors, Dr B S Shekhawat, Head of the Department of Psychology and Additional Principal at the Government Medical College, Kota, told PTI he had written for clinical psychologists and counsellors; however, they were yet to be appointed.
Dr Shekhawat claimed one expert clinical psychologist is available in the department and he is at service with faculties of department and MD students. He has also undergone training of clinical psychology.
Dr Shekhawat stressed psychologists should be trained one with adequate experience.

“They have extended professional psychological counselling to around 400 patients, most of them coaching students since the counselling centre started in September this year,” Dr Shekhawat said.
Principal Secretary, Medical Education, T Ravikant did not respond to WhatsApp messages for his comment on status of the proposal for the M Phil course in clinical psychology and the requirement of clinical psychologists in the state.
Meanwhile in the private sector, there are reportedly three-four clinical psychologists, including a couple of them in two coaching giants.
Currently, a team of 96 counsellors with two clinical psychologists are working under him and extending psychological counselling and treatment to students at its various centres in the city, Dr Harish Sharma, principal psychologist at one of the coaching giants in Kota said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-jeemain-neet-despite-increase-in-suicide-cases-kota-faces-shortage-of-clinical-psychologists-9078937/,education

National Mathematics Day: Why do we celebrate it today?,"The aim of celebrating this day is to highlight the achievements of Srinivasa Ramanujan, and to stress upon the idea that having a formal and high-end educational training is not the only way to achieving greater accomplishments.","The National Mathematics Day is celebrated annually on December 22 to commemorate the birth anniversary of Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Born in 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan had almost no formal training in pure mathematics.
Known as one of the greatest Indian mathematicians of all time, Ramanujan worked on theorems that seemed almost impossible to solve. He is known for the work he did in the areas of continued fractions, Riemann series, elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series and functional equations of the zeta function.
National Mathematics Day — the origin
While Ramanujan passed away at the mere age of 32 (in 1920), it was years later that the Government of India decided to celebrate his birth anniversary in the form of National Mathematics Day.
National Mathematics Day: Srinivasa Ramanujan at Trinity College, Cambridge. (Source: Wikimedia)
In 2012, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared December 22 as National Mathematics Day, and 2012 was also termed and celebrated as the National Mathematics Year.
Interestingly, the 2012 India stamp also featured Srinivasa Ramanujan. A few years later, in 2017, the Ramanujan Math Park was opened in Kuppam, in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh on December 22.
In 1991, Robert Kanigel also penned a biography of the Indian mathematician, which was then adopted in the form of a movie by Matthew Brown in 2016. The book and the movie adaptation give a detailed account of his upbringing in India, his achievements and his mathematical collaboration with mathematician GH Hardy.
A still from the The Man Who Knew Infinity.
Theme, aim
Usually, there is no specific theme of National Mathematics Day, and schools celebrate it as per their plans. The aim of celebrating this day is to highlight the achievements of Srinivasa Ramanujan and to stress the idea that having formal and high-end educational training is not the only way to achieve greater accomplishments. Like Ramanujan, children are motivated to go beyond textbooks and engage in critical thinking and logical reasoning.

"Parul University’s European Academic Expedition Spurs Global Collaborations, Including Prestigious Cambridge University","Parul University remains steadfast in its commitment to internationalization, aiming to provide extensive academic exposure to both students and faculty.","Against the backdrop of India’s expanding global influence, this Vadodara-based university has been actively contributing to the nation’s international educational footprint through its distinguished collaborative initiatives. Dr. Preeti Nair, the University’s Director of International Relations, led a comprehensive international expedition across Europe, fostering connections with institutions such as Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland, and others, all dedicated to advancing higher education and fostering strategic relations.
The expedition’s objectives were multifaceted, encompassing the establishment of new partnerships, reinforcement of existing collaborations, and the creation of pathways for opportunities for Indian students abroad. Parul University remains steadfast in its commitment to internationalization, aiming to provide extensive academic exposure to both students and faculty. As a result of initiatives led by delegates like Dr. Nair, the university has expanded its collaborations to over 100 partners across Europe, Canada, the USA, New Zealand, Japan, and Asia.
As part of these international endeavors, the Director of International Relations represented Parul University at a global education conference in the Netherlands. This conference provided a platform for engagement with officials from various countries, facilitating not only the strengthening of existing partnerships but also the exploration of new collaborations in territories not commonly associated with Indian universities.
During the expedition, Dr. Nair also visited Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland, a longstanding partner, to fortify the partnership and explore opportunities for additional programs in Business Management, Social Work, and Architecture.
Parul University’s commitment to internationalization aligns with the national agenda for a global India, epitomizing the ideals of “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” through the advancement of education. A significant highlight of the expedition was the visit to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, where discussions on potential collaborations and academic relations took place. These efforts underscore the university’s emphasis on quality in its global portfolio, contributing to India’s higher education initiatives.
The expedition also included visits to Nottingham Trent University, Coventry University, and Solent University in the United Kingdom, as well as a journey to Poland to strengthen existing partnerships and explore new opportunities with Wrocław University of Science and Technology and Poznań University of Technology.
Dr. Preeti Nair emphasized the university’s vision of internationalization, ensuring inclusivity across disciplines and backgrounds. She stated, “As a university, our vision is to ensure the highest level of inclusivity, and we embark on such expeditions to provide a global experience for every student.” The university’s proactive approach involves developing active partnerships that translate into tangible academic opportunities for both students and faculty.

Indians in top colleges | ‘Oxford University is an experience of lifelong learning’,"Like most Indian students, my introduction to Ivy League colleges was through the internet and movies, writes Nehal Kaul","(In this series, indianexpress.com will talk to Indian students who have secured admission to some of the top universities or Ivy League colleges across the world. They will share their journey — from deciding upon the course and college to the importance of SoPs, LoRs, other documents and more)
Nehal Kaul
Like most Indian students, my introduction to Ivy League colleges was through the internet and movies. I got to know about them when I was in Class 10 and since then, I wanted to study at one of these universities.
I am now pursuing an MPhil in Economics at Oxford University, where I started in September 2023.
When I started applying for an MPhil, I made a list of universities I wanted to apply to. Some were in the UK, some in the US, and others were spread across Europe and Asia, but I ended up applying to universities only in the UK (LSE, UCL and Oxford).
ALSO READ | ‘NTU (Singapore) helped me grow confidence; want to work for IITs or ISRO after this’
I decided upon Oxford because of the course structure and the freedom to customise the course based on my interests.
Admission process
I think the most effective way, and perhaps the best way, to research universities is by going to their official websites which provide the most accurate and up-to-date information. Apart from this, I also noticed that reaching out to people who are studying at these places is very helpful.
ADVERTISEMENT
Most admission processes begin in October. One should always start researching at the beginning of the year if one plans to apply so that they don’t miss out on any opportunity.
If there is a deadline then one should aim to apply at least two weeks before that. Keeping a buffer period for two weeks ensures that if something goes wrong at the very end, one has enough time to fix the error.
In terms of the process, one should narrow down the field they are interested in and follow it by checking the programme website of the courses. Once you have your top 10 or top 20, you can reach out to people. In my experience, more often than not people are willing to talk and help you out.
ADVERTISEMENT
The admission process is quite different from that in India but very similar to other international universities. One needs to take the GRE and IELTS exams before applying. In addition to this, I submitted a statement of purpose outlining my interests in the field and what I want to work on in the future.
I also submitted my CV and for Oxford, I had to send in my research work as a writing sample. I was also asked to send in letters of recommendation, which were written by my undergraduate professors at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), University of Delhi.
Beyond academics
The willingness to go beyond academics is a great way to see the real-world impact of your field of study. An internship or research project related to your field or an experience that helped you explore more is always a plus.
The internships I did revolved around the field of development economics and economic policy impact on various fields and industries and helped boost my chances.
Extracurricular activities which enable you to explore your field beyond academics also help.

Oxford, the way of life
The first few days at Oxford were challenging — not only I was in a completely new country, but I also had to figure out things I had never done before.

In retrospect, I found shopping for cleaning supplies funny and was shocked to see how much stuff there is just to clean your house. As a kid and living with your parents, one never thinks about such things — buying hand wash, dishwasher, and detergent. It is a moment which is equal parts shocking and scary.
Luckily, the student culture at Oxford is one of the best in my experience. What still surprises me is how easy it is to walk up to anyone — be it your coursemate, someone from a different course or even your professors — and talk to them. I appreciate how encouraging people here are to you asking questions and doubts.
ADVERTISEMENT
The other favourite thing is the formal dinners at different colleges. During these dinners, you are seated next to a stranger and can not only make friends but also learn about other cultures and countries.
I have had the opportunity to talk to an individual in the development field, another pursuing a PhD in cancer studies, someone who is working on finding methods to mainstream Ayurvedic medicines, and someone in their late 50s doing a PhD in computer sciences.
Over the past two months, I have interacted with people from all across the world and come to understand their cultures and perspectives which has helped me open my mind to diverse viewpoints and develop a broader worldview.
At Oxford, after meeting people with a range of experience in terms of academics or internships, or maybe life in general, I have realised what it means when they say there is no end to learning.
As I know there is always more to learn, it has motivated me to go that extra mile to put things in perspective and explore beyond the field of academics.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indians-in-top-colleges-oxford-university-9075911/,education

"Dropout rate at 27% in Class 10, not 49.9% as stated by Centre: Odisha government","Former Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) president Prasad Harichandan held the ""faulty policy of the state government"" responsible for high dropouts.","The Odisha government on Tuesday claimed that the dropout rate in Class 10 was 27 per cent in the state in 2021-22 and not 49.9 per cent as stated by Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in the Lok Sabha a day before.
Odisha School Education Programme Authority Director Anupam Shah asserted that the Centre’s data did not include the number of students admitted to various industrial training schools after passing the 10th standard.
He also said the school and mass education department will soon clarify its stand on the prevailing dropout rates at the school level.
Responding to a question on Odisha registering the highest dropout rate of 49.9 per cent in Class 10 in 2021-22, he said, the data released by the Centre was old.
“The data released by the Centre did not include the number of students admitted to different industrial training schools. The overall dropout rate at present (2022-23) in Odisha would be 17 per cent,” Shah told PTI.
He explained that the dropout rate is calculated by comparing the number of students in Class 11 in a year and the same in Class 10 in the previous year.
“However, there is no mention of students who pass the 10th standard and take admissions to technical and vocational schools, polytechnic and open schools across the state,” the official said.

The dropout rate in Class 10 stands at 20.6 per cent as of 2021-22 with Odisha being the worst performing state in this regard followed by Bihar, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The dropout rate in Class 10 was 49.9 per cent in Odisha and 42.1 per cent in Bihar, Pradhan said in his written response.
Meanwhile, the opposition BJP and the Congress slammed the BJD government in the state over the “rising” dropout rates in schools.
ADVERTISEMENT
BJP leader and opposition chief whip in the assembly, Mohan Charan Majhi, said, “Odisha topped the list of dropouts at the Class 10 level. It is a shame for the people who claim that they have brought rapid transformation in the education sector. Odisha has registered a downward transformation in school education.” The rate of school dropout was 12.8 per cent in 2018-19, and the same increased four-fold to 49.9 per cent in 2021-22, he claimed.
“Can we call it transformation?” the BJP lawmaker asked, adding that the BJD government’s claim is “baseless”.
Former Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) president Prasad Harichandan held the “faulty policy of the state government” responsible for high dropouts.
“The government has constructed some beautiful school buildings but there are no teachers. Who will motivate students belonging to poor families to continue their studies, if there is a dearth of teachers,” he asked.
Harichandan also alleged that a large number of students migrate to other states as labourers because of “massive unemployment in Odisha”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/dropout-rate-class-10-stated-centre-odisha-government-9075732/,education

Only 1.55 lakh engineers are likely to be hired in the IT/tech sector,"As major IT companies freeze fresher intake, alternate sectors are opening up demand.","Amid global layoff, hiring of freshers is likely to further decline in the current fiscal as major IT companies look to freeze the intake of freshers, as per a report by TeamLease Digital.
In comparison to 2.3 lakh freshers hired in the previous financial year, 1.55 lakh freshers are likely to be hired in the IT/Tech sector this fiscal, report claims.
With approximately 1.5 million engineering graduates actively seeking IT/tech roles, muted market sentiments and intensified skills evaluation mechanisms have created a turbulent landscape, it added.
The report is based on secondary sources, including news reports and company reports, it said.
Meanwhile, as major IT companies freeze fresher intake, alternate sectors are opening up demand.
Other segments, including Global Capability Centers (GCCs) and non-tech sectors like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), communication, media and technology, retail and consumer business, life sciences and healthcare, have expanded entry-level hiring. This reflects a noteworthy shift in the hiring landscape, as per the report.
“The tech world is evolving rapidly, and we need to keep up. It is not just about companies broadening their hiring horizons, but also about ensuring that the talent pool of our country is ready for it. A united front can be forged through the collaborative efforts of the industry,
academia, and government, leading to relevant programs and curricula being designed. Government initiatives play a pivotal role in supporting skill development and research projects aimed at tackling industry-specific challenges. This is not a one-off effort, but a collective movement to nurture talent at scale and meet the industry’s changing needs.”,” TeamLease Digital Business Head Krishna Vij said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/only-1-55-lakh-engineers-are-likely-to-be-hired-in-the-it-tech-sector-9075690/,education

"Are Australian universities setting campus in India charging more for same courses? Check fees, facilities","While the tuition fees is almost the same, students will be taught by international faculty at some Australian universities setting up campus in India.","After the government’s nod, as of now, two Australian universities — the University of Wollongong and Deakin University — have confirmed and started the process of setting up their campuses in India.
Deakin University has recently announced applications for the Master of Business Analytics and Master of Cyber Security (Professional) programmes, which will begin in July 2024. For this course, students will have to pay an annual fee of about AUD 19,000 (Rs 10 lakh). The varsity will also offer postgraduate courses in Cybersecurity and Business Analytics.
On the other hand, the University of Wollongong India will offer a Graduate Certificate in Computing and Master of Computing (Data Analytics), followed by further undergraduate programmes in 2025. Student fees will be set at 50 per cent of those incurred by international students studying at UOW’s Australian campuses. Students are usually asked to pay around AUD 18,000 (Rs 9.9 lakh).

To draw a comparison, in India, the fee for an MBA from one of the top management colleges of India, the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B) costs nearly Rs 24.50 lakh (for two years). This fees covers tuition, library, internet, case permission royalty, course material, hostel room rent, service charge, medical insurance, personal accident insurance and alumni activity. However, it excludes Service Tax and any other tax. Such taxes, if made applicable by law, will be collected from students at the prescribed rates. Additionally, students will have to pay mess advance of Rs 30,000 each term.

In IIM Ranchi, the fee for MBA, MBA-HR and MBA-BA programme for the batch 2023-25 will be Rs 17.2 lakh (excluding caution deposit, alumni fee and mess expense). Similarly, at IIM Calcutta, the fee for a similar PG course — Post Graduate Diploma In Business Analytics — is Rs 25 lakh. This does not include caution money, food-related expenses, lodging and any travel expenses that the students may incur in the fourth semester when they visit any industrial location.
While these are government colleges, even the Indian private business schools don’t cost as much as these international campuses. The Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur which ranked at ninth position in NIRF Management rankings 2023 charges nearly Rs 9.90 lakh for the first year of MBA-BM course, and Rs 9.40 lakh for the second year.

The perks of paying more in the Indian campuses of these Australian universities, however, is that there will be opportunities for students to study a semester at the main Wollongong campus or other UOW offshore campuses in Dubai, Hong Kong, or Malaysia.
A similar trend will be followed for Deakin University. “All of the programmes can be delivered in India, but because the programme is delivered with an identical curriculum and a teaching period structure that is the same as we offer in Australia, it means that should they wish to spend one of those three teaching periods in Australia they could absolutely do that. We don’t anticipate that many will want to do that, because I think if you wanted to come to Australia, you’d probably be coming to Australia, but the option is there, and it’s lined up to be able to do that,” said Prof Iain Martin, Vice Chancellor of Deakin University.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/are-australian-universities-setting-campus-in-india-charging-more-for-same-courses-check-fees-facilities-9052758/,education

CLAT 2024 Result: Check alternate options for law courses,"As you move past the aftermath of a disappointing CLAT result, remember that these setbacks can lead to unexpected opportunities in the future. So, accept the journey ahead with determination.","— Amritendra Kumar
The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is taken by about 60,000 students annually, making the competition fierce for prestigious spots in some of the best law schools of the country. With limited seats and a high number of students, securing a place becomes challenging. Understandably, many students fall short of this goal. So, if you find yourself among them, fear not.
Here are alternative paths you can consider in case the CLAT does not work out for you
How to deal with this pressure?
Dealing with stress after the CLAT results can be challenging. However, several crucial steps can help you effectively navigate this period. Begin by recognising your mistake to gain a clear understanding of a Plan B for the future. To address this, embrace your emotions like the natural feelings of embarrassment, anxiety, grief, fear, and anger as these feelings can motivate you to prepare better. Look for healthy coping mechanisms like talking to a friend, relaxation techniques, or engaging in passion-related activities that bring you peace. Moving forward, create a strategic plan and focus your energy on new possibilities.

New directions to explore
Options after just missing NLU cut-offs: If your rank falls within the high range of 3000-4000, consider exploring alternative colleges such as the School of Law, Nirma University; School of Law, NMIMS; School of Law, UPES, BITS Law School among others. These institutions accept admissions based on CLAT scores which can offer you promising opportunities beyond the NLUs.
Explore alternative entrance exams: If your CLAT rank is not promising, consider other entrance exams for other law schools like LSAT-India for private colleges nationwide including Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat; SLAT for Symbiosis Law Schools; NLAT for NMIMS; CUET for government universities across the country; Jamia Millia Islamia; CET for GGS IPU; MH CET for colleges in Maharashtra including Government Law College Mumbai and ILS Law College Pune, among others. These law schools offer good legal programmes, providing aspiring students with an alternate route.
Board exams clashes with CLAT: If it is CLAT that you are determined to crack, consider taking a drop year to prepare afresh. It is important to focus on your Class 12 exams too, so you can ace those board exams this year and re-appear for CLAT next year. Use this time to reassess your study methods, strengthen your foundation and gain an edge for next year’s exam.

Consider related specialisations or professions: If you’re interested in other law-related fields like Corporate Law, Media Law, Intellectual Property Law, or Entertainment Law, explore professions aligned with these interests before returning to law. Moreover, pursuing a three-year LLB degree instead of the typical five-year programme is an option often overlooked as it can provide a foundation for later transitioning into law. Additionally, you can explore diverse career avenues beyond traditional litigation such as Legal Technologists, Cybersecurity and Privacy Law, or Human Rights and Social Justice.

"My Dear Students | Michael Lewis’ ‘Going Infinite’, and the learnings from it","'Attention spans are now measured by the amount of time we spend on things between looking at our mobiles. I have banned mobile and laptop usage from my classrooms, but I find that in faculty meetings my hands move towards my mobile phone as if driven by some mysterious forces beyond my control,'","(‘My dear students’, a fortnightly column that is a conversation with young minds on current events, books, popular culture — just about anything that’s worth talking over a cup of coffee.)
My dear students,
Today I want to talk to you about a recent book by Michael Lewis on Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the crypto tycoon turned offender. SBF is now facing decades of jail time for misappropriating the money of his clients. Michael Lewis has written some wonderful books in the past. The one that I liked the best is the Undoing Project, a book about an academic partnership between two Israeli psychologists, and the research that came out of their collaboration. The description of their academic work was interesting but what really elevated the book was its ability to weave riveting life stories of the two protagonists around and through their academic work. Lewis’s subjects are not merely professionals or academics, they are humans with motivations that we can identify with and backstories that make us understand their motivations. Lewis’s book on SBF, titled Going Infinite, has a similar structure of professional and human descriptions twined together, except that I am not clear even after having read the book about SBF’s motivations for misusing his clients’ money.
However, the collapse of SBF’s empire is not the main theme of today’s column. It is not even the main theme of Going Infinite. Further, even though the book is about the rise and fall of a crypto tycoon, there is very little explanation about crypto technology or blockchain in the book. Lewis admits that it is futile to try and describe the technology. No description will actually match the facts. This was a sobering realisation for me. The technology and the underlying explanations of cryptography are so complicated that it’s not possible to explain these in a book aimed at the general population. This does not portend well for our understanding of other allied technology like artificial intelligence and biotech.
I recommend the book to you just to get a feel of the crypto ecosystem where things that are considered normal would be considered crazy by most people. I am used to the new rhythms of the age we live in. Attention spans are now measured by the amount of time we spend on things between looking at our mobiles. I have banned mobile and laptop usage from my classrooms, but I find that in faculty meetings my hands move towards my mobile phone as if driven by some mysterious forces beyond my control.
My Dear Students | Let’s reflect on the classroom teaching experience; has it lost its value?
What’s addiction to digital technology got to do with SBF? Well, the more hilarious bits in the book have to do with the utter incapability of SBF to focus on any conversation unless he is also playing a video game at the same time. That he does it not only with fellow tech bros but also with people like Anna Wintour (Editor in Chief of Vogue) brings to mind the new sensibilities of our age. You will have to read the book to find out but it’s safe to say that SBF’s first meeting with Wintour was also his last.
Like young people elsewhere, SBF is impatient with platitudes about doing good in the world. He wants to make a difference, and not merely on op ed pages. He signs on to something called effective altruism, a philosophical activist movement that is aimed at high earners and motivates them to use their money to do good in the world. I want you to play close attention to this phenomenon as it appears to have quite a following among people who are both young and rich.
ADVERTISEMENT
Incredibly, as one reads Going Infinite, SBF appears to have a desiccated view of morality, and this is what makes him a complex character. His morality has nothing to with empathy. He doesn’t really feel for other people. He has a sense that he should put money into important causes but he has no sense of how to make other people (or himself) happy. He confesses that he does not know what it is to be happy.
When altruism lacks empathy, strange consequences can follow. The effective altruists spend a lot of time discussing existential threats from AI in the distant future rather than remedying immediate problems of child nutrition in Africa. Why? Because even a small probability of a threat that will have global consequences is worth fighting for compared to a narrower more immediate problem. Maybe there’s a math here that works for effective altruists but I find it decidedly odd. Ultimately SBF represents the promise and pitfalls of conducting a life based on probabilities.
I wonder if a rendition of the world in mathematical terms makes one blind to other imaginations of the world. SBF is dismissive of discussions around literature. It’s all subjective according to him. There is no truth to the matter, people just have views about what Shakespearean texts (for example) mean, and since there are no scientific metrics to determine who is right, there is no point to studying interpretational issues in Shakespearean literature. This is just the kind of attitude that might result in some floundering when it comes to matters of life that are not amenable to metrics. Even worse, metrics might blind a person to more immediate risks (like financial compliance) because a small probability of getting caught is not worth spending much time on. SBF appears to have found this out the hard way.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/my-dear-students-michael-lewis-going-infinite-and-the-learnings-from-it-9070765/,education
"‘It all started easy and fun, but got tense during internships, placements,’ IIT Bombay student shares | Life in an IIT",JEE Main 2024: The Madhya Pradesh boy got a lot of exposure on how things go about in the real world after taking admission at the IIT.

I was always fascinated by robot-building videos and wanted to learn more about them. I also liked mathematics and problem-solving which made me think that I should pursue engineering. I cleared JEE Advanced in 2020 by securing a rank of 1743 and chose the Electrical dual degree programme at IIT Bombay. The dual degree programme is an integrated MTech and BTech. I am now in my fourth year.

Vaani Kapoor’s Call to Lifelong Learning Echoes at Parul University’s Convocation Ceremony,The 7th Annual Convocation ceremony served as a testament to Parul University's dedication to holistic education and its commitment to shaping the next generation of leaders and innovators.,"Bollywood actress and youth icon Vaani Kapoor delivered a powerful message of empowerment and self-belief to graduates at Parul University’s 7th Annual Convocation ceremony. Joining the fellow guest of honour Boman Irani, Kapoor addressed a crowd of 9,980 graduates and 16,000 guests, marking the culmination of yet another successful academic year at the esteemed university.
In her inspiring speech, Kapoor emphasized the importance of continuous learning and the power of friendship. “Never stop learning and growing,” she said, urging graduates to embrace lifelong learning as a key to success. “And remember, the friendships you forge here will be your support system throughout your life.”
Kapoor also highlighted the value of cultural traditions, praising Parul University for its commitment to upholding Indian heritage. “I am proud to be a part of an institution that values its roots and embraces its cultural identity,” she stated. She further encouraged graduates to be “sources of light” for others, using their knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world.
Alongside Kapoor, Boman Irani shared his personal story of overcoming challenges and achieving success. He emphasized the importance of self-pride and taking risks, urging graduates to persevere in the face of adversity. “Never be afraid to take risks,” he said. “Some of the greatest failures lead to the greatest successes.”
The 7th Annual Convocation saw a remarkable rise in Ph.D. graduates, with 82 students receiving gold medals and 6 exceptional alumni awards bestowed. The ceremony also recognized the achievements of 31 students who received merit certificates for academic excellence.

42% of the 1.76 lakh Indian students granted Graduate Route visa; review may have big impact,"In its annual report, Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) stated that the 'the government needs to decide what the purpose of the graduate route is'","The UK government is set to conduct a review of the Graduate Route visa allowing overseas students a two-year post-study work option. This visa was announced in September 2019 and enforced by former home secretary Priti Patel in July 2021.
Since then, 42 per cent of the 176,000 students granted a Graduate Route visa were Indian nationals, which means any changes to this category will have a significant impact on Indians.
“I wouldn’t like to get into exactly what they (Home Office) are going to ask us to look at but there are a range of options there,” MAC Chair Professor Brian Bell told reporters in a virtual media briefing.

“At the moment, essentially, there’s no restriction on what you can do (under the Graduate Route); if you’ve got the money, you can just sit around and do nothing in the UK for two years… You could obviously restrict it to being certain types of job or certain types of activity that you would choose and also limit it in terms of what universities you went to, what courses you did if you wanted to limit it… I’m not saying that would be something that the committee would recommend, but it will be something we will certainly consider in an overall review,” he said.
In its annual report, the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) stated that “the government needs to decide what the purpose of the graduate route is. If the objective is to attract talented students who will subsequently work in high-skilled graduate jobs, then we are sceptical that it adds much to the Skilled Worker route which was already available to switch into after graduation, and we expect that at least a significant fraction of the Graduate Route will comprise low-wage workers,” the report stated.
Meanwhile, the UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that the government will now be taking strict actions to reduce the number of immigrants in the country, and a ban on dependent visa for all international students (except research students) will be one of the measures taken for it.

Now, when we are putting selfie points with pictures of a leader who has made us proud globally and taken the country to different heights, what is your problem?

“Children are clicking selfies, they are celebrating it. It is not mandatory… but a matter of pride… the prime minister of a country is not of any party or class but of everyone,” he said.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) had last week asked universities and colleges across the country to set up selfie points at strategic locations in their campuses to raise awareness among youngsters about India’s achievements in various fields.

The migration/withdrawal if any, is mainly on account of securing seat by the students in other departments or institutions of their choice or on any personal ground.”

IIT aspirants should look beyond placement packages | A lesson from IIT,"While the prospect of securing a promising career is undoubtedly appealing, the intrinsic value of an IIT journey encompasses a multitude of benefits that endure throughout one's professional and personal life, the IIT Guwahati Assistant Professor says.","– Debanga Raj Neog
It was November 2010, a peak placement time at IIT Guwahati, with companies like Google, Schlumberger, and Yahoo offering lucrative packages. I was in my fourth year of BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Guwahati. My parents, relatives, and everyone were curious about my placement preparations, but my aspirations differed. I had been engrossed in research projects since my second year of BTech and had developed a deep passion for research supported by the research facilities at IIT-G. By then, I had completed two international internships and I was in the process of writing two conference papers based on their outcomes. My ultimate goal was to pursue research abroad.

“We have winter vacations every year and the same is the case this year also. The vacations were scheduled from December 9 but have been preponed,” Registrar Ateekur Rehman told PTI.
Asked about the ongoing examinations of the students, he said the students will write the remaining papers upon their return from winter vacation. “We will ensure that there is no academic loss for the students,” he added.
Protests were held at the NIT-Srinagar on Tuesday over a student’s social media post allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The protesters demanded stringent action against the non-local student who has been sent home on leave.
The students blocked both the gates of the institution, located in the Nigeen area of the city, and raised slogans inside the campus.

The website of the NIT Srinagar has been taken down “for maintenance”. “Sorry for the inconvenience but we’re performing some maintenance at the moment. If you need to you can always contact us, otherwise, we’ll be back online shortly!” the message on the website of the NIT Srinagar reads.

"US issues record-breaking 1,40,000 visas to Indian students last year: Official","The US has issued more than 10.5 million visas in 2023 so far, which is 2 million more than what it had anticipated and is almost hitting the highest-ever level at its overseas missions.","As part of the Biden administration’s endeavour to promote people-to-people ties with India, the US issued more than 1,40,000 visas to Indian students last year and is taking several steps to reduce visa appointment wait period.
In an interview, Julie Stufft, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services, said US missions in India worked six, seven days a week to make sure that students could be interviewed before their classes started. This year, the US made a huge effort to concentrate on the demand coming out of India, she said.
“We are really proud of what we have done in India this year. I think for the first time in history, we set a goal to issue one million visas in India and not only did we accomplish that, but it was done several months in advance. So, the number will go way beyond that.

“There are record-setting numbers this year for workers, crew members and students applying in India to come to the United States,” she added.
Stufft further said, “We specifically made sure that we saw the students who were applying coming out of India. India is now the largest source country for foreign students in the United States, as well as many other visa categories. That’s a very important one for us. We have also had a lot of cases where the interview was waived, so no interview for Indian travellers who have previously travelled and are now going back to the US.” Last year, the US issued a record over 1,40,000 visas to Indian students, she said.
“For students who are applying in India, I would say the biggest thing is that the missions there have worked six, seven days a week to interview students to make sure that everyone can be interviewed before their classes start. The amount of effort and importance that we place on Indian students coming to the US is born out in the visa process. We want to make sure everyone has that chance,” she said.
The US, Stufft said, is working on taking several steps to reduce the visa appointment wait time in India, which is still a bit high.

“I hope it will be (coming down) this year, meaning this fiscal year for us. But we are sending huge numbers of officers to India to manage the wait time and move them around the country as needed. I mean, it has gotten much better but it still needs to come down quite a bit,” she said.
“We had a state visit recently. Everyone from the president of course, to Ambassador (Eric) Garcetti and the secretary of state is so committed to making sure that the people-to-people ties between our two countries expand. We are carrying that out in the visa process. So, we really expect more innovations and a much quicker process in the future,” Stufft told.
The State Department official said anyone who is interested in travelling to the US for any reason should apply as soon as possible.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If you are travelling for work-related reasons, there’s another special avenue to use. There is a special channel to use so that business-related visas are also prioritised. Bear with us, I would say as we get through this.
“India is unique because it represents the highest number of visas in several categories. Not just visitors, not just students, not just maritime crew members but highly skilled work. I mean, it is a tremendous demand across the board for us. So our priority is to get all of those wait times down,” she said.

During a media round table with a group of foreign journalists organised by the Foreign Press Centre, Stufft said the US has issued more than 10.5 million visas in 2023 so far, which is 2 million more than what it had anticipated and is almost hitting the highest-ever level at its overseas missions.
“Half of our overseas missions set their own record for that country for adjudications of visas in that country. We set records for visa adjudication, for work visas and for student visas as well in some (other) categories,” she said.
For 2024, the US is still working very hard on reducing wait times, Stufft said.
“In some overseas locations, we still have very high wait times, some exceeding a year still for one category of visa, which is a first-time visitor, someone who needs an interview for their visa.

“All other categories have low wait times globally, but we are very focused on the first-time visitor interview wait times and what’s very interesting to us is that many of the places where we have set records for visa production this year are the same places where we still have really high wait times. This just indicates a very high level of demand and we are going to use this year to really get control of that in these five or six places with very high wait times,” she said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/us-issues-record-breaking-140000-visas-to-indian-students-last-year-official-study-abroad-9047109/,education

“Almost 90 per cent of the Academic Council members will oppose this proposal as it is an anti-student and anti-teacher move. Classroom teaching is very important for many students who come from different backgrounds and this will also impact the need for teaching staff who will be substituted by online learning on Swayam,” she said.
The proposal is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that aims to achieve 50 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GRE) in higher education by year 2035 with the help of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by the Swayam platform.
The Academic Council in June 2019 had sought the Executive Council’s approval for the adoption of the UGC (Credit Framework for Online Learning Courses through SWYAM) Regulations, 2016.
Earlier this year, the university’s Department of Commerce had expressed its desire to implement MOOCs developed by teachers of the department and develop its course content based on the curriculum of the university.

"A Lesson from IIT | STEM-Humanities convergences for fostering creativity, innovation, and stimulating sustainable progress","Innovation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is a product of a promising mind interacting with a conducive social system, the IIT Madras Associate Professor says.","— Tiju Thomas
The National Education Policy (2020) has recommended several reforms. For the purpose of this article, we shall focus on two goals: (i) (technological) innovation in education, (ii) blurring of the boundaries between sciences, humanities, and commerce disciplines. These goals are interesting, can be richly interpreted, are potentially sweeping in their scope, and hence call for some deliberation. These goals, if properly understood and carefully implemented could indeed make a transformative impact on higher education in our country.

Bihar launches ‘Mission Daksh’ for nearly 25 lakh academically weak school children,"During the regular inspection and monitoring by the DMs that started in July, it was found that there is a considerable number of academically weak students in almost all state-run schools, the letter said.","The Bihar government will launch a programme in December for nearly 25 lakh children lagging woefully behind their peers in schools with some of them incapable of reading simple Hindi words despite having reached upper primary classes, officials said on Thursday.
As part of the programme, ‘Mission Daksh’, the state Education Department has directed teachers to intensively mentor such students, in batches of not more than five, with the “warning” that any laxity will cause them to face action.
Additional Chief Secretary of Education KK Pathak wrote to all the district magistrates (DMs) on November 21, requesting them to supervise the progress of the programme in their areas on a daily basis from December 1.
District-wise monitoring committees, headed by DMs, would be formed for the effective execution of ‘Mission Daksh’, it said.

During the regular inspection and monitoring by the DMs that started in July, it was found that there is a considerable number of academically weak students in almost all state-run schools, the letter said.
“Keeping this in mind, the department has decided to launch ‘Mission Daksh’ from December 1 in all government schools across the state to improve the academic performances of such students,” it said.
“Academically weak students are much behind their peers in schools… some of them are incapable of reading simple Hindi words properly despite having reached upper primary classes,” it added.
Pathak directed that such students be identified on a priority basis.

“After that, the principals will ask teachers to conduct extra classes (post-lunch) with not more than five children at a time. Such students often need individualised attention in order to fully grasp difficult concepts and bridge the learning gaps. This targeted approach will also allow teachers to personalise their teaching methods in a way that suits the unique needs of each weak student,” he said in the letter.
“All 25 lakh (approximately) such (academically weak) students will appear in their final examinations in April, 2024. If these students fail in their final examinations, strict departmental action will be initiated against their headmasters/ principals and teachers by the Education Department,” he said.
The Nitish Kumar government has been taking a slew of stringent measures to improve the quality of education in the state over the last one year.

"‘Pressure’ from parents behind student suicides, says Supreme Court","Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario.","“Intense competition” and “pressure” of parents on their wards preparing for competitive exams are the main reasons for the rising number of suicides across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday.
Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario.
“These are not easy things. Pressure from parents is behind all these incidents. More than the children, it is the parents who are putting pressure on them. How can the court pass directions in such a scenario,” the bench told advocate Mohini Priya, appearing for the petitioner – Mumbai-based doctor Aniruddha Narayan Malpani.

Justice Khanna said, “Although, most of us will not want any coaching institute to be there, but look at the conditions of schools. There is intense competition and students have no other option but to go to these coaching institutes.” Referring to the 2020 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Priya said it highlights that around 8.2 per cent of students in the country die by suicide.
The bench said that it knows about the situation but the court can’t pass directions and suggested that the petitioner instead approach the government with his suggestions.
Priya sought to withdraw the plea to approach the appropriate forum, which the court allowed.
The plea filed by Malpani through Priya said that it seeks appropriate directions for regulating the conduct of “profit-hungry private coaching institutes mushrooming across India which provide coaching for various competitive entrance examinations such as IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)”.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said that the petitioner has been constrained to approach the court as several students have died by suicide in recent years “facilitated by the absolute lack of regulation and oversight by the Respondents (Centre and state governments)”.

“Children as young as 14 years enter these coaching factories often away from their homes and undergo rigorous preparation in the anticipation of getting admission to a good medical or engineering college.
“After being in a protected home environment, the child is suddenly exposed to the harsh competitive world without being mentally equipped to do so. These profit-hungry coaching institutes, however, do not care about student well-being and are only focussed on minting money leading to the youth of India being pressurised enough to take their own lives,” the petition said.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said that children are being made to live and study in these coaching factories in subpar and abnormal conditions which are severely affecting their mental health.
“What is most dangerous about mental health is that it is invisible, unlike other ailments in our body. However, just like other physical ailments, mental health problems too are triggered by extrinsic forces, surrounding environment and pressures,” it said.
The plea said that student suicides were a grave human rights concern.
“The lackadaisical attitude of the Centre in enacting a law despite the rising number of suicides clearly reflects upon the State’s apathy towards protecting these young minds who are the future of our country and their constitutional right to live with dignity guaranteed under Article 21,” the plea alleged.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/pressure-from-parents-behind-student-suicides-says-sc-9036566/,education

CAT 2023: Affirmations for exam day,What are the key things to keep in mind while appearing for CAT 2023 exam? Read these tips and tricks for an expert to ace the management exam.,"— Ramnath Kanakadandi
For students who have been preparing for the last few months, the day of reckoning is now a few days away — the CAT 2023 exam day. While this is the time when the stress levels are high and every aspirant would be thinking of the best way to utilise the remaining time, it is essential to stay calm and plan your days, keeping in mind your academic performance and even your physical and mental health.
A few days before CAT 2023 exam
Identify your areas of weakness. Make sure that you work on these areas in the best way possible, but do not over-stress on them. In the worst case, make sure that the preparation in these areas is such that you will be able to answer at least the easy questions from these areas.
Last day before CAT 2023 exam
Over the past many years, we have seen the best of students cracking under the enormous (self-created) pressure and therefore, it is critical that you reduce the pressure and lighten the load on your mind if you are to do well in the CAT. Take care of these two things for this:
— You should keep telling yourself that, as far as the preparation for the exam is concerned, you have done whatever you could do and that you will now do your best in the exam. Tell yourself that the end-result does not matter to you, and more importantly, believe in that. Remember that you will not be able to achieve anything by worrying about your preparation. Please remember that not doing well in CAT is not the end of the world and that there will be numerous other management entrance exams where you can prove your mettle and come out with flying colors. An enterprising, hardworking and intelligent person like you will be able to achieve many things in life.
— Do not undertake any serious preparation during the last couple of days before the CAT 2023 exam. Certainly, do not work on any new test papers or exercises; the most you should do is ‘light revision’ – brushing up on formulae/concepts. You can pick up selected problems from the AIMCAT papers that you have taken and run through them – try to recollect the concepts involved and the approaches needed. Do not put yourself under pressure to solve the questions again.
Things to take care of, other than academic preparation
— Ensure that you visit the exam centre at least a day before the test day to find out its exact location, how to reach the place, and how much time it will take to reach the place. Do not be satisfied by just taking directions from somebody to reach the place. You should take maximum care to arrive at the centre well in advance with all the necessary documentation (admit card, ID proof etc., as specified by the CAT authorities). This becomes even more important if your centre is in a place other than your home town.
ADVERTISEMENT
— Do not wear any jewellery or carry any valuables with you as you may not be allowed in or may be asked to keep them outside the hall. This should not be a reason for distraction. If you can, go to the centre with a friend/family member who can take care of your wallet/keys and any valuables. They can also help you keep a cool head before you enter the exam hall. 
— Make sure you do not get into discussions about the test with other students at the test centre. You may also see some students referring to books or discussing questions at the test centre. Just ignore them and concentrate on staying calm and focused.
— Before you enter the exam hall, use the restroom if need be. In general, once the test starts, you will not be allowed to leave the exam hall until the test is over — which could go over 2.5 hours from the reporting time. 
ADVERTISEMENT
— Do not go to the exam with any expectation about the pattern/ difficulty level of the test, the composition of the sections or about the models of questions that are likely to appear. Any such speculation will only heighten your worry.
— If the table / bench / chair / monitor / keyboard are not proper, please ask for a replacement or a change in the position before the exam starts — once the exam starts, the invigilator may not entertain such requests from you. Even if they do, that may cause you to lose valuable time.
— Do not skip breakfast/lunch for the exam. Having a light breakfast/brunch/lunch will help you be energised throughout the test.

‘Are school report cards telling enough?’,"Report cards, which many parents rely on for a sense of their children's progress, might be missing the whole picture, researchers say.","Nearly nine out of 10 parents believe their child is performing at grade level despite standardised tests showing far fewer students are on track, according to a poll released on Wednesday by Gallup and the nonprofit Learning Heroes.
Report cards, which many parents rely on for a sense of their children’s progress, might be missing the whole picture, researchers say. Without that knowledge, parents may not seek opportunities for extra support for their children.
“Grades are the holy grail,” said Bibb Hubbard, founder and president of Learning Heroes.
“They’re the number one indicator that parents turn to to understand that their child is on grade level, yet a grade does not equal grade-level mastery. But nobody’s told parents that.”
In the Gallup survey, 88% of parents say their child is on grade level in reading, and 89% of parents believe their child is on grade level in math. But in a federal survey, school officials said half of all US students started last school year behind grade level in at least one subject.
In a report examining grade point averages and test scores in the state of Washington over the past decade, researchers found grades jumped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many districts had eased their grading policies to account for the chaos and hardship students were experiencing.
Some of that leniency could still be in place, masking gaps in learning that are showing up in standardised tests, but not in grades, said Dan Goldhaber, a co-author of the report and the director of the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research.
ADVERTISEMENT
Districts across the US have invested federal pandemic relief money in programs to get students back on track academically, from intensive tutoring to summer academic programs. But often far fewer students show up than the district had planned, Goldhaber said.
For programmes like summer school or online tutoring, where the family chooses whether to participate, “what we see is that it is only a fraction of the students that are invited or eligible to that are actually participating,” he said.
The Gallup poll findings underscore that trend, pointing to families who may not realise they should take action about their child’s academic performance.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the poll of more than 2,000 parents of K-12 students, half the respondents say they’ve discussed their child’s academic progress with a teacher. But among parents who know their child is behind grade level in math, the percentage skyrockets: 74% have spoken with the teacher.
Report cards generally don’t convey enough information, said Sarah Carpenter, director of The Memphis Lift, a parent advocacy organisation in Tennessee.
“A report card is really tricky in our opinion, because you’re just looking at A’s and B’s and C’s,” Carpenter said. Nowhere on the report card does it say “what reading level your baby’s on, and that’s what’s throwing parents for a loop.”
By talking to parents about issues like literacy and the nuances of grading, families are better able to advocate for their children in the school system and work in partnership with educators, said Trenace Dorsey-Hollins, a parent and founder of the advocacy group Parent Shield Fort Worth in Texas.
“Knowledge is power,” she said. “Parents don’t know what they don’t know. So we don’t want them to blame themselves. But now that you have the information, use the information to demand better and ensure that your child and all children get exactly what they need.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/are-report-cards-telling-enough-many-parents-dont-know-when-kids-are-behind-in-school-9027536/,education

India surpasses China as top source of international graduate students in US: Open Doors Report,"Here's how India doubled its share over 10 years, closing in on China's dominance among international students in the US.","The number of Indians pursuing postgraduate studies in the United States (US) increased 63 per cent to 1.65 lakh in academic year 2022-23 — surpassing China for the first time in 15 years to become the largest source of international graduate students in America. There were 1.26 lakh Chinese graduate students in the US during the same period.
According to the latest Open Doors Report released on Monday, 2.68 lakh Indian students were studying in the US last year at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, including those enrolled in Optional Practical Training programmes, which allow foreign graduates with F-1 or student visa to engage in paid or voluntary work for up to three years. This is 35 per cent more than the 1.99 lakh students recorded in 2021-22, and represents the largest single-year jump in at least 23 years, data analysed by The Indian Express shows.

35% increase in number of Indian students in US: Report,"Study Abroad: Behind China and India, nations sending the most students to the US were South Korea, Canada, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nigeria.","International students have returned to US colleges, fuelled by a surge from India. Students attended US universities in high numbers last year, rebounding from a pandemic slump. There was a 35 per cent jump in students coming from India, according to a study released on Monday.
Overall, the number of international students in the US grew by 12 per cent in the 2022-23 academic year, the largest single-year increase in more than 40 years, according to findings from the State Department and the nonprofit Institute of International Education. More than 1 million students came from abroad, the most since the 2019-20 school year.
“This reinforces that the US remains the destination of choice for international students wishing to study abroad, as it has been for more than a century,” said Allan E Goodman, CEO of the Institute of International Education.
American colleges enrolled nearly 269,000 students from India, more than ever and second only to China. Most came for graduate programs, often in science, technology and business.

“The US maintains a strong relationship with India on education, which I think is getting even stronger and even more connected,” said Marianne Craven, the State Department’s acting deputy assistant secretary for academic exchange.
China still accounted for the most foreign students in the US with 2.90 lakh, but its numbers decreased for a third consecutive year.
It reflects a gradual shift. After years of booming demand from China, interest has ebbed amid chilly international relations and increased competition from universities in the United Kingdom and Canada. Officials behind the new study also blame prolonged travel restrictions in Asia during the pandemic.
At the same time, US universities have focused on recruiting in India, hoping to tap a growing population that the United Nations predicted would overtake China as the world’s largest this year. Students from India now outnumber those from China in 24 US states, including Illinois, Texas and Michigan, which rank among the top destinations for international students.

For the second consecutive year, America’s graduate programmes were the main attraction for international students, the study finds. Graduate enrollment grew by 21 per cent, while undergraduate numbers ticked up 1 per cent.
It reverses a trend from the previous decade, which saw undergraduates come in larger numbers.
Much of last year’s growth is credited to math and computer science programmes, which attracted more students than any other subject and saw a 20 per cent boost in enrollment over the previous year. Engineering and business followed behind. Taken together, those three fields account for more than half of all international students in the United States.
The surge nearly brings international numbers back to their pre-pandemic highs, with a peak of almost 1.1 million students in 2018. Enrollment fell precipitously over the following two years as COVID-19 stifled academic exchange.
The rebound appears to be continuing, with an 8 per cent increase in international enrollment this fall, according to a smaller survey meant to give a snapshot of recent trends.
ADVERTISEMENT
Overall, international students made up just 5.6 per cent of all college students in the 2022-23 year, but they play an outsize role in US higher education. University leaders say they’re important for global exchange, and they’re also important for revenue — international students are usually charged higher tuition rates, effectively subsidizing college for US students.
Behind China and India, nations sending the most students to the US were South Korea, Canada, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nigeria. Last school year saw a record number of students come from Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Pakistan and Spain.
While more students come from abroad, many colleges are struggling to attract students at home. Total enrollment across all colleges has stayed in a slump in the wake of pandemic decreases, and freshman enrollment decreased by 3.6 per cent in fall 2023, according to a separate study by the National Student Clearinghouse.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/35-increase-in-number-of-indian-students-in-us-report-9024676/,education

My Dear Students | Let’s reflect on the classroom teaching experience; has it lost its value?,'Are we making teaching and learning better and more enjoyable?' asks Nuggehalli.,"My dear students,
Today I want to give you some idea of what I have been telling my students about the value of classroom teaching. We are packing you like sardines in cans for hours on end; at the very least we must reflect a bit on what you and I, teachers and students, are getting out of it. I don’t mean I get a salary and you get a job at the end of it. I mean to ask if we are making teaching and learning better and more enjoyable or are we just sticking to something that has outlived its value. I am teaching legal philosophy this term. This is what I am telling my students. There are some references below that are specific to legal philosophy but I don’t think that will come in the way of your reading.

"The magic of Chemistry lies in solving problems plaguing the world, writes IIT Guwahati professor",“Global warming is primarily due to increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. What if you could create a powder that would grab those molecules and convert them to food or medicine?”,"— Arun Chattopadhyay
There is no one who has not loved chemistry. Those who studied science would have enjoyed the beauty of chemistry even more. Chemistry is about molecules and chemical bonds. We cannot see an individual molecule. We cannot feel a molecule. Both bonds and molecules are really tiny. How small are they?

UK’s Institute of Civil Engineers: Anusha Shah takes over as first Indian-origin president,Shah was one of the only two candidates to win a Commonwealth scholarship in 1999. She came to the UK to pursue an MSc in Water and Environmental Engineering at the University of Surrey.,"The Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) has elected the first Indian-origin president in its 205-year history in Professor Anusha Shah. ICE is an independent professional association for civil engineers and a charitable body in the UK representing 95,000 members.
As the institution’s 159th president, Shah took charge of her new role with a presidential address on the theme of nature-positive civil engineering at ICE’s London headquarters on Tuesday evening.
Shah specialises in water and environmental engineering, with over 22 years’ experience in designing, managing and leading projects and programmes in the UK and internationally.
“My presidential year will be about how we become a nature and people-positive profession at heart,” Shah stated in her speech.
“We have failed to understand the interrelationship between infrastructure and nature. We are implementing nature-based and green solutions globally, but in pockets. It’s not the norm yet,” she said.
According to Professor Shah, in her 40s, construction is responsible for 30 per cent of biodiversity loss around the world, but adopting a nature and people-positive approach will enable engineers to reverse the environmental decline.
“Not only will we reach net zero faster, we’ll also improve climate resilience and reap multiple benefits for our society and the planet,” she noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a film accompanying her speech, Shah said that it was time for civil engineers to better understand the inter-relationship between infrastructure and nature and do more.
“Building assets which do less harm to our natural world is not good enough anymore. To put it simply, we don’t have an option but to be nature-positive… Our infrastructure needs to interact with nature in a way which is restorative and regenerative, rather than extractive,” she said.
Shah grew up in Kashmir where the natural surroundings and their interaction with the built-up elements fascinated her from an early age. It was at the age of 23 that Shah discovered a consultancy in New Delhi working on the conservation of the Dal Lake in Kashmir and turned up at their office to talk her way into a consulting project engineer’s role.

She went on to become one of only two candidates to win a prestigious Commonwealth scholarship in 1999 and came to the UK to pursue an MSc in Water & Environmental Engineering at the University of Surrey.
“There’s absolutely nothing you can’t achieve if you set your mind to it and drive your life with the right values,” she told students as she accepted her honorary doctorate from the University of East London for her services to climate change in engineering.
The same year, in 2021, the University of Wolverhampton gave her an honorary professorship for knowledge transfer. Shah’s other firsts include the youngest ever and first female chair of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London Region, before becoming a fellow of ICE in 2016. Two years later, she founded the climate change consultancy Plan for Earth with a focus on creating awareness around the climate crisis.
“I’m a civil engineer and I’m also someone who constantly thinks of global problems, how to change the world for better, contribute to make it fair and peaceful, solve water scarcity and create climate resilience and leave behind assets for our future generations,” she said.
Shah works as a senior director for resilient cities and the UK climate adaptation lead at Arcadis, a Netherlands-based global design, engineering and management consulting company. She is currently seconded to the Effiage, Kier, Ferrovial and BAM Nuttall joint venture on the UK’s High Speed (HS) 2 rail project as senior director of environmental consents.

Shah is also a non-executive director at the UK’s Meteorological Office, a Royal Academy of Engineering visiting professor at King’s College London on climate adaptation, sustainability and inclusive design and a visiting professor at the University of Edinburgh.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/uks-institute-of-civil-engineers-anusha-shah-takes-over-as-first-indian-origin-president-9018983/,education

"CUET UG Toppers’ Tips: ‘Do not ignore Class 11 syllabus,’ SRCC BCom Hons student suggests","CUET UG Toppers' Tips: The CUET UG topper, Vani Gupta, scored an overall pass percentage of 95 per cent in Class 10 and 97.6 per cent in Class 12.","Vani Gupta of Uttar Pradesh’s Noida appeared for CUET in its debut edition in 2022. She appeared for five papers – economics, business studies, accountancy, English and mathematics and secured 100 percentile in all subjects except mathematics. 
Gupta has been academically a bright student throughout her school life. She scored 95 per cent in CBSE Class 10 and 97.6 per cent in Class 12. The 19-year-old, currently pursuing a BCom (Hons) from Shri Ram College of Commerce, shares how she prepared for the CUET UG.
My CUET experience
I did get nervous when appearing for my CUET UG exam, especially the maths paper. After reading the question paper, I felt like I was not adequately prepared for it.
Read | CUET UG 2024: How to master Reasoning questions of General Aptitude section
I had maths, economics and English in one day and one month later, I had to appear for business studies and accountancy. To appear for all the papers together, one has 200 minutes, meaning 40 minutes for each subject. The first exam I appeared for was maths, and I clicked it by mistake and the exam suddenly started. I wanted to start the CUET paper with the English paper. 
The maths paper was difficult and lengthy as compared to the rest. The paper carried ‘match the following’ type of questions where we had to solve three to four questions to arrive at the solution. That was a bit difficult and time-consuming. 
Some business studies questions on planning and business environment were difficult and tricky. English was fairly simple. 
What was my preparation strategy?
For CUET, I prepared through my Class 12 books. I knew I wanted to get admission to a Delhi University college which would require me to score maximum in board exams. When we started our Class 12 academic session, the CUET exam was not announced so I focused on my Class 12 subjects from the start.

Read | CUET UG 2024: Understand the syllabus, analyse exam pattern; follow this preparation plan
I picked up several well-known MCQs from the bookstalls but after taking the exam now, I felt those questions were not at par. I bought Career Launcher and TIME’s booklets and MCQ sets from the APC Publishers and Alka Dhawan for Business Studies.
Advise for aspirants
– Choose the right mix of subjects in CUET.
– Be careful when choosing what paper to start the exam with on the exam day. I selected maths first and I became nervous after finding the paper time-consuming.
ADVERTISEMENT
– CUET English paper focuses on grammar, and reading comprehension, unlike the CBSE English syllabus. 
– Do not ignore the Class 11 syllabus. It is important for minute concepts. Class 11 concepts from all the subjects including accountancy, business studies and economics are required in Class 12 and are also asked in CUET
– CUET tests school knowledge, so focus on the school curriculum

Life in SRCC
While filling out the CUET application form, SRCC was my first preference. However, I also opted for St Stephen’s College, LSR and other Delhi University colleges. I always wanted to study at the University of Delhi and SRCC’s legacy, its faculty and its current standing in academia inspired me to study here. I also did not want to go to an all-girls college so that was also a factor I considered while choosing SRCC.
I do not think choosing and getting into the best college will define anyone’s life. It is up to us how we utilise the resources and get ourselves groomed with the environment and excel.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cuet-ug-2024-toppers-tips-do-not-ignore-class-11-srcc-bcom-hons-student-says-9015195/,education

NEET UG 2024: Why is Physics considered a nightmare?,"Students can overcome their fear of physics and do well on the NEET exam, which will open doors to a rewarding medical career, if they have the correct attitude and prepare enough.","— Saurabh Kumar
Physics has been known as a nightmare for many prospective candidates of NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test) due to its complex equations, abstract principles, and difficult problem-solving. While all three subjects — Physics, Chemistry, and Biology — play an important role in NEET, Physics is frequently cited as the most scary.
Let’s take a look at why Physics is regarded as a nightmare for most NEET applicants.
Mathematical complexity:
Physics is inherently mathematical, hence a solid foundation in mathematical principles is required. NEET candidates must solve complex questions involving calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. Many students struggle to bridge the theoretical physics principles and their mathematical applications. Students who are afraid of difficult equations and mathematics might feel frightened off by the subject.

Combination of theory and application:
A solid relationship between theory and real-world application is essential to physics. Though academic knowledge is important, NEET questions often contain real-world scenarios that call for problem-solving abilities. It could be difficult for students to make the connection between their academic understanding and how to use it to solve complex issues.
Extensive and vast syllabus:
The NEET Physics syllabus is comprehensive, encompassing topics such as mechanics, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, optics, and Modern physics. The sheer number of knowledge could exhaust the students, leaving them unable to prioritise and effectively cover all topics.
Lack of practical experience and knowledge:
ADVERTISEMENT
Physics frequently lacks hands-on experience in the NEET preparation process, in comparison to Biology and Chemistry. Lack of real-world experience might make it challenging for students to relate to the material and see how it might be used in the real world.
Fear of getting less marks
Among NEET applicants, the fear of performing poorly in Physics might lead to tension and anxiety. A poor Physics score can have a big effect on the NEET ranks as a whole and restrict your possibilities for admissions in top medical institutions.
Overcoming the nightmare:
In physics, conceptual questions and numerical problems account for a larger portion of the course, covering material from classes 11 and 12 equally.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some of the important and high scoring topics which should be covered by aspirants include – Mechanics which includes topics like laws of motion, work, energy, and power, and system of particles and rotational motion, Optics, Electrodynamics which covers electrostatics, current electricity, and magnetic effects, thermodynamics, Electricity and Magnetism, followed by waves and sound, modern physics, Semiconductors, Kinematics among others.
Even though physics may be difficult for many NEET applicants, it’s important to understand that, with the correct strategy and mindset, success in this subject is possible.
The following techniques can assist students in overcoming the fear of physics:
1. A practical study plan: Aspirants should create a study schedule that is well-organised and gives enough time to each Physics topic. They should sort the topics according to level of importance for the NEET exam.
2. Regular solving of mock papers: Physics is a subject that gets better with experience and regular practice. To improve problem-solving abilities, students should work through a range of situations and attempt as many mock sample papers of NEET exam from previous years which can assist in knowing the mistakes being made and rectify them.
ADVERTISEMENT
3. Be thorough with the NCERT syllabus: NCERT books cover a major portion of the NEET syllabus, which can help in providing you an advantage over your peers and can help you grasp the principles and fundamentals giving a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
4. Regular practice and revision: A comprehensive revision plan and consistent revision are essential components for preparing for the physics section. Set dedicated time slots each day for problem-solving and conceptual reinforcement if you want to succeed in physics.
ADVERTISEMENT
5. Effective time management: Create a workable schedule and allot enough time for every topic and revision. Controlling the amount of time you have left for preparation can also help you answer questions on the exam day more quickly and accurately with enough time left for going through the paper.
In conclusion, despite the fact that the mathematical complexity, abstract ideas, and wide syllabus of Physics may make the subject seem like a nightmare for many NEET aspirants, it is crucial to approach Physics with a focused study plan.

IITs have failed to address a crisis: Students lack the freedom to choose their branch,"'Fewer choices are driving IIT students away from engineering,' writes Kapadia.","— Anush Kapadia
There is a crisis in the undergraduate (UG) programs of IITs. There are two related symptoms arising out of it: UG students in the nation’s most prestigious engineering institutions are not becoming engineers; they are also not in the best mental health.
While this is a complex problem, one way forward would be to give students the freedom to choose their branch of study after they are admitted to university.
This would replace brutal external compulsion with internal motivation, ensuring that students really love what they learn because they chose it after exploring various options. This could be better than the suffering they are put through for four years in a branch they didn’t even know enough about to choose at age 18.
Also read | NTA changes website for JEE Main 2024; jeemain.nta.ac.in new host
Freedom to choose would make for happier students who are actually invested in engineering. They could then be the agents of an industrial society that the IITs were set up to engineer.
Lulled into a false sense of success by the dazzling pay cheques of a handful of graduates who probably would have made it anyway, distracted by the daily grind of teaching and research, and perhaps immobilised by a sense that the task is beyond their institutional powers, the IITs have failed to address the crisis in their BTech programme. But there are several impediments to enhancing student freedom coming from students and parents as well.
The students and their parents are sanguine about the non-engineering outcomes of the IITs because “engineering” has long since been hollowed out at the UG level, becoming a code word for “general education” or “rigorous mental training” coupled with high academic prestige and a shot at upward mobility. IITs do not produce many engineers from their much-vaunted undergraduate program, but they do produce some winners in a society that has desperately few avenues for winning. Running this rat race is what focuses the minds of the undergraduate and their guardians.
ADVERTISEMENT
In this way, “engineering” in India has become the equivalent of what Greek and Latin stood for up to the late 19th century in English and American higher education: a skill that was intrinsically useless but technically difficult, valued as a symbol of “being educated”, a credential providing access to the professions. Engineering in its essence is obviously not useless, but it has been made useless in India for a whole host of reasons such as our failed industrial policy, the ease of the brain drain to the service-sector dominated Anglosphere, and the caste-based hierarchy between mental and manual labour.
JEE Main 2024 | NTA releases revised syllabus; check list of topics removed
The sad proof of the hollowing out of the IITs’ undergraduate engineering education is that the top engineering students in the country do not go on to become engineers. Yet this is exactly the opposite in the United States. Data from the US Department of Education show us that a full 85 per cent of those with bachelor’s degrees in engineering go on to jobs related to their degrees.
Why is this? Because Americans have the freedom to choose their branch after they are admitted to the university, not before. They get a full two years of their four as UG students to explore different courses before they have to settle on a “major.” This obviously ensures that there is a much better fit between a student’s interest and aptitude and their branch or major. And this surely helps account for the innovative nature of the US economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
This feature of American undergraduate education is not well appreciated in India, yet it is dominant in all universities, technical institutions, and indeed high schools. Thus you do not get admission into, say, MIT’s Computer Science department. You get admission into MIT as a university and then you have the freedom to choose the course in which you want to major. Lest we think that this means an automatic rush for Computer Science, MIT’s own data shows that only one in three MIT UGs choose computer science. Freedom to choose means students do not herd into fashionable majors; they in fact spread out across the university and find their individual calling, which is why their jobs are actually related to their education.
But we could reasonably argue that that Indian 18-year-olds lack the maturity and independence to go beyond the parental and societal writ and explore their own interests, perhaps especially when the future livelihood of the family is at stake.
Also read | Your engineering branches will matter less and less in the workplace of future, writes IIT Bombay professor
Ironically, this is exactly the same argument that was made regarding American UGs during 19th century debates that brought freedom of choice into the American system. The detractors of the “elective system” argued that American UGs where nothing like those produced by the impressive German Gymnasium high schools. They, therefore, required a strict structure of Greek, Latin, and the classics to give them a broad, “liberal arts” education, broad enough to equip them for all future pathways. Out of these debates came that particularly American form of UG education: a broad set of “general education” requirements coupled with the freedom to choose your major.
Needless to say, we have to build our own system that suits our own conditions and aims. But our expectation that if all UG students were given a choice, they would choose Computer Science comes from our tacit assumption that our UGs can only behave as a herd, not as individuals. While this may well be true in the Indian context, this is arguably because UGs have not been given a safe space within which they can develop their individuality to begin with.
To continue to condemn undergraduates a choice-less education is in fact to hamper their ability to make independent choices at all. Yet the data show us that lack of choice is precisely what is driving IIT students away from engineering and into unhappy marriages with externally-enforced careers.
ADVERTISEMENT
If the IITs are to be useful to the taxpayers that fund them and true to their mandate, they will encourage students to choose their branch after they are admitted, not before. IIT Bombay has made a start in this direction with a small undergraduate program that allows 30 students the freedom to choose. Being focused on the rat race has made students so risk-averse that most of them fail to see the value in the freedom to choose. But we are looking for a few outliers to get us started. Attitudes are naturally slow to change, so IIT Bombay is playing the long game on our students’ freedom to choose.

"JEE Main 2024: Candidates, experts debate on need for change in JEE syllabus","JEE Main Syllabus 2024: Some experts believe that rationalising the JEE Main syllabus would ease the pressure among the engineering aspirants, while many others feel that the exam quality would be diluted too much.","JEE Main 2024 Syllabus Reduced: Recently, the NMC revised the NEET UG 2024 syllabus after considering the rationalised CBSE syllabus, which has been changed in NCERT books too. Due to this move, JEE Main 2024 aspirants are hoping that their syllabus might be reduced too.
Some experts believe that rationalising the JEE Main syllabus would make sense. “The pressure will remain the same if the JEE syllabus is not changed and students will have to read two different syllabi, one which is for board exams, and the other by NTA. Revising the syllabus, as per the revised NCERT pattern, will reduce stress among students and will give a unified learning experience across the country,” said Saurabh Kumar, chief academic officer at Vidyamandir Classes, a coaching institute for JEE and NEET.

"‘Hone your skills, seek mentors, build strong network,’ suggest winners of Study UK Alumni awards",These awards celebrate the achievements of outstanding UK Alumni who have made an impact through their work in their respective fields.,"Puja Changoiwala and Abhinav Sinha have won the Study UK Alumni Awards 2023. Changoiwala is the winner of the Creativity and Culture Award for India and a global finalist under the same category, Sinha won the Science and Sustainability Award for India.
The British Council in collaboration with UK universities initiated the Study UK Alumni Awards in September 2014. These awards celebrate the achievements of outstanding UK Alumni who have made an impact through their work in their respective fields.
Puja Changoiwala completed her MA in Journalism from the London-based University of Westminster in 2010. She is a published writer who talks about marginalised sections of Indian society through her writing and reporting. Abhinav Sinha completed his MRes and PhD from the University of Glasgow. Currently, he is a senior scientist at the National Institute of Malaria Research.
Some excerpts from the interview…
How was your experience studying in the UK?
Abhinav: My experiences of studying at the University of Glasgow were phenomenal and pivotal, as they not only shaped my career into an entirely different dimension but also helped me excel in that field. The dual exposure during my masters and doctoral studies must be credited for whatever I have achieved in the field of malaria research. The quality education I received in the MRes course laid the foundation in just one year and brought me at par with the global standards in the field. The way the course was designed helped me build my conceptual foundation and then exposed me to obtain world-class practical experience, all in just one year. This not only saved my time, as a comparable course elsewhere would have taken at least three years, but it also prepared me to compete for entry into the highly competitive Wellcome Trust studentships for PhD. Eventually, it allowed me to secure admission into a PhD programme at the same university. The doctoral training I received at the University broadened my horizons and exposed me to the world-class cutting edge research in molecular basis of diseases, which led to the discoveries I have made. Apart from this, the weather in Glasgow is something that cannot be easily forgotten.
Puja: My MA equipped me with innumerable skills that continue to guide me today. At a young age, it exposed me to diverse stories, perspectives and experiences. For instance, I wrote an article about the Tibetan diaspora in London for a school assignment, read books like Bruce Garrison’s ‘Professional Feature Writing’, and heard journalists like Mehdi Hasan. Specific modules, too, made for crucial training. For instance, the ‘Online Journalism’ module taught me how to write for the web in 2009, a time when online journalism was only finding its feet. It prepared me to be a part of the rapidly globalising media landscape, a revolution led by the internet. This skill holds relevance to my work even today.
How did you decide that you wanted to study abroad?
Abhinav: With a deep interest in pursuing a philosophical degree, obtaining a PhD from the United Kingdom has always been my foremost aspiration. My motivation stemmed in part from the inspiring experiences of my elder brother and sister-in-law, both of whom had earned their doctoral degrees from the University of Reading in the UK.
ADVERTISEMENT
My desire to pursue this path led me to embark on a search for a suitable supervisor in the UK, eventually culminating in my discovery of Dr Lisa Ranford-Cartwright at the University of Glasgow. She strongly encouraged me to apply for the Chevening Scholarship, which was a highly competitive endeavour. However, my determination and efforts paid off, and it marked the beginning of my remarkable five-year journey in the UK.
Puja: There were several reasons why I chose to study journalism abroad at the University of Westminster. First was the university’s stellar reputation in the field of journalism, the course structure, and the expertise of the faculty, which included teachers like Patrick Stoddart, a former editor with The Sunday Times. Then there was the appeal of the diverse learning environment and the exposure to different cultures and viewpoints. I was also excited about the prospect of studying in London, a global journalism hub with an ever-evolving media landscape.
How has your experience been (in terms of employability) since you graduated?
ADVERTISEMENT
Abhinav: The MRes programme played a pivotal role in shaping my academic foundation and preparing me for the doctoral degree which I did under Prof Andy Waters at the same University and was funded by the Wellcome Trust. The doctoral training further sharpened my skills and the work culminated into a significant discovery of a gene in Plasmodium (the malaria causing parasite) that is responsible for switching the sexual reproduction in the parasites. The discovery, published in Nature (the highest impact factor among the journals publishing basic science) with me as the first author, is a milestone in itself. This discovery filled a crucial gap and opened a new vista in understanding the biology of malaria transmission.
The impact of this research conducted at the University of Glasgow reverberated further, leading to my appointment as a senior scientist at the National Institute of Malaria Research, a premier and apex national institute carrying malaria research under the Indian Council of Medical Research. Because of the significant experience gained in the UK and my discovery, I have been able to explore new areas in malaria research and have published more than 30 papers in six years and led a nationwide project on estimating malaria burden in India. All these experiences in the UK and India have been instrumental in getting a prestigious grant to organise an international course on Malaria in November 2022. In addition, I have been awarded 10 international grants including those from The Company of Biologists Ltd, UK; Government of India; European Molecular Biology Organization, Wellcome Trust India Alliance; Institut Pasteur; Malaria Eradication Scientific Alliance; Keystone Symposia; Scottish Overseas Research Students Awards; Glasgow Postgraduate Excellence Scholarship.
Puja: The skills I gained at the University of Westminster helped me immensely in finding a job after graduation. Due to that, immediately after graduating in 2010, I found work as a correspondent and editorial writer with Asian Affairs, a London-based magazine. Here, I penned editorials on political developments across South Asia, while also reporting on parliamentary debates around various issues in London. After a year with the magazine, I returned to Mumbai in September 2011.
What is your advice to students who are now graduating from foreign universities and want to take up research in the future?
Abhinav: I have made short videos and photographs with my masters and doctoral students in India, showcasing the culture of science I encountered during my six-year tenure in the UK. In fact, I have managed to inspire a couple of students in my current institution to apply for the master’s programme at the University through the Chevening Scholarship, and one student’s application is currently under review. When I was setting up my laboratory in India, I used these videos to demonstrate the setup process to my colleagues and students.

For the students who want to pursue research, the quality of education in the UK is certainly among the best in the whole world. Each university in the UK has a few niche areas of excellence that can be leveraged when selecting a university in the UK. Funding should not be a problem for a deserving candidate. However, it is important to be meticulous and focused when applying for scholarships and grants. I found the supervisors in the UK extremely considerate. They readily provide guidance and recommend various funding sources for students to explore and apply.
Puja: For students graduating from foreign universities and aspiring to pursue research, I recommend following your passion for your research topic, honing your skills, seeking mentors, and building a strong network. Focus on publishing and presenting your work, stay resilient, consider further education if needed, and maintain a balance between work and personal life for a rewarding research career.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/hone-your-skills-build-strong-network-seek-mentors-suggest-winners-of-study-uk-alumni-awards-8998964/,education

You are now forming your own opinions on how to engage with these issues. You might even have strong opinions about these seemingly intractable problems. The issues of international politics concern all of us. You can’t just leave it to the politicians, even if the politicians are the ones closest to the action.

From setting up campus to being top-ranked: IIM Bangalore director Rishikesha T Krishnan reflects on institute’s 50-year long journey,"By offering high-quality MBA programmes and creating managers who are leading some of India's most important business enterprises, IIM Bangalore is making significant contributions to the nation, says institute director Rishikesha T Krishnan.","The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), one of the leading business schools of India, was the third IIM to be established in 1973, after IIM Calcutta and IIM Ahmedabad. The institute will kickstart its golden jubilee celebrations on Thursday.
IIM Bangalore was formally inaugurated by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 28, 1973, and its journey began from rented premises on Langford Road in Bengaluru. The reputed business school is spread over a 100-acre campus on Bannerghatta Road, initially designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Dr BV Doshi.
In 1973, IIM Bangalore started with the first Post Graduate Programme (PGP) batch of around 50 students. The two-year PGP batch commenced in July 1974 and the first convocation was held on July 10, 1976, with 48 students graduating. In the past 50 years, the institute has grown exponentially and now has around 1,200 students across various degree-granting programmes and 5,000 annual executive education participants. The institute boasts of over 25,000 alumni who occupy positions of global leadership.

Rishikesha T Krishnan, director of IIM Bangalore, joined the institute in 1996 and has since then served it in different capacities. He took charge as the director of the institute on July 20, 2020. He talked to indianexpress.com about IIMB’s contribution to the nation, taking charge during the Covid-19 pandemic, the importance of research and more. Some excerpts from the interview:
Q: You took charge as the director of IIM Bangalore right when the Covid took over the world. How did you manage this challenge?
Krishnan: IIMB was pretty quick in adapting to the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic. We had experience with online education due to MOOC (massive open online course) activities since 2014. Therefore, several faculty members were conversant with what it takes to do effective teaching online.
During the 2020-21 academic year, quite a few courses were offered in the online format. While that particular year was quite badly affected because of the lockdown, the following year (2022) – even as Covid continued – we were able to slowly get back to life on campus. Though some classes were being held online, students were able to attend them from the hostel. Students were able to carry on with other activities in the hostel. Of course, there were disruptions, but I think the positive side is that we were able to adapt quickly and provide a good online learning experience.

Q: IIMB is completing 50 years of inception. Could you please tell us some of the main landmarks of these past five decades?
Krishnan: IIMB was started with a vision to provide managerial talent to drive the public sector. We also tried to create a central focus on other sectors like agriculture, energy, rural development etc as part of the curriculum.
Fast forward to the mid-80s, the philosophy of the country also started changing. The public sector was no longer the focus of all investment and attention. Even though the formal liberalisation process started in 1991, many people believe the seeds of liberalisation were sown a little earlier than that. Reflecting on this, we also became more oriented towards general management and started having a focus on corporate, but certainly in a more explicit way from the early 1990s.

We have also tried to use our location in Bengaluru to further the interests of the institute as well as our stakeholders. In 1998, we got into a collaboration with the IT industry and started a weekend MBA programme. The reason for launching this programme was since the IT industry was about to take off, they did not have the strength of management capability which they required to sustain that growth.
Around 2000-2001, we realised that we need to be present in public policy in a different way. After the first 10 years of liberalisation, it was clear while the private sector would drive the economy, there was a need for the government to provide a good regulatory framework, ensure there is a level playing field etc. At that time, IIMB decided to start another new postgraduate programme in Public Policy and Management to create the managerial and policy talent needed to drive policy-making and regulatory activities. This was supported by the Government of India and some external funding agencies like UNDP [United Nations Development Programme].
Somewhere in the middle of the decade, around 2005-2006, we also took a deliberate decision that we needed to enhance both the quality and quantity of research work being done. When the institute started, it focused more on teaching, and though there was research, a lot of it only focused on the sectors which I mentioned earlier.

So, in 2005-06, we decided to put a greater focus on rigorous academic research, resulting in publications in top journals. The initiatives taken back then were surely successful as now we are widely recognised as a research-intensive management institution in India.
In 2014, IIMB decided to adopt the new emerging technology of digital learning. So we set up a MOOCs platform with edX, a US-based platform started by Harvard and MIT. We became one of the partners of edX and since then we have offered more than 16 different courses on the platform.

Q: IIMB is known (among the alumni community) to have a ‘go-getter’ atmosphere…
Krishnan: Today, there are a lot of opportunities, be it companies conducting contests, startup opportunities, and much more. The biggest challenge for students is how to use their time effectively in the face of so many different exciting things that are happening.

We have a good incubator on campus and a lot of exciting things happening in startups. Students have access to go and talk to these companies; sometimes these startups also give projects to students. Many of our faculty members are involved actively in a lot of interesting projects, and sometimes they make some of those opportunities open to the students as well. We bring in a lot of interesting guest speakers, industry leaders, startup founders, and so on – some of these events happen in formal settings and others in informal settings.
Students also have events that they organise on their own such as Vista, Eximius and more.

In a way, through this, students show that now in India it is not just about a classroom activity, but overall experience where students have an opportunity to experience a wide range of things. Our job is to nudge them and ensure that they maintain some balance between all these different opportunities. This way, students come out with good skills and capabilities to be successful in the industry.
Q: IIM Bangalore became quite known after the shooting of the Bollywood flick ‘3 Idiots’. Do you think it helped bring the institute into the spotlight?
Krishnan: In the US, several campuses got visibility as they allowed shooting films on campus. I can only guess that might have also been in the minds of the IIMB administration when they encouraged the shooting of ‘3 Idiots’, in addition to the positive messaging of the movie.
I was living on the IIMB campus when the movie shooting took place, and a lot of my long-lost friends suddenly rediscovered me during those days because they all wanted to come and see the shoot.

Earlier, Aamir Khan stayed somewhere else but after struggling through the city traffic on the first day of shooting, he decided to move to our campus. He stayed in the IIM Bangalore hostels for a few months. Every evening he would play badminton or some other game with the students. He used to frequently walk around the campus.
There have been some changes too with this. Earlier, the famous water tank used to be open but now we have restricted entry to that water tank as we do not want anybody getting up on top and then slipping and falling.
It is certainly something which has made the IIMB campus known in the country and even internationally. Now, most people come to the campus and wish to visit the famous spots from ‘3 Idiots’. On YouTube, there is a video which allows you to map the different scenes in ‘3 Idiots’ to the actual locations. I have seen people wandering around with their phones in their hands and trying to locate the spots.
Q: IIMBx, the MOOC section of IIMB is facilitating access to highly qualified academicians. What are your plans for expanding the reach?
Krishnan: In 2014, we embraced MOOCs by becoming an edX partner resulting in over 50 high-quality management courses offered globally on this powerful platform over the next seven years. According to a recent study, two of these courses are among the 100 most popular edX courses of all time and around 2 million learners have enrolled in our MOOCs courses since inception.
The Women Startup Program (WSP), which is an initiative carried out by NSRCEL, the entrepreneurial centre of IIM Bangalore (with support from the Department of Science and Technology in its first and second runs, and later with the support of Goldman Sachs in the third run) used the IIMBx MOOC, ‘Do Your venture: Entrepreneurship for Everyone’, for skill-development of women entrepreneurs. The MOOC was delivered to cohorts of 3,000, 6,500 and 10,000+ women in the first, second and third runs of the programme, respectively.
NIRF Rankings of IIM Bangalore over the past few years.
IIMBx partners with the National Commission for Women (NCW), India, to deliver the same MOOC to 5,800 women entrepreneurs participating in NCW’s Empowering Women through Entrepreneurship Programme.
Apart from edX, IIMBx offers courses on SWAYAM, iGOT Karmayogi (for government employees) and its own platform. Led by its faculty, IIMBx uses digital learning tools to enable anytime, anywhere learning in a global classroom.
Q: What steps has IIMB taken to address the evolving needs of the industry and to foster entrepreneurship and innovation among its students?
Krishnan: India needs high-quality MBA programmes to meet the needs of a growing economy. We play multiple roles like we are an important source of new ideas for the government and industry. For example, an IIMB study has led to the waiver of stamp duty on low-cost housing to provide a fillip to the sector.
We often play the role of neutral and unbiased experts on policy and even legal matters (the Karnataka High Court recently asked our faculty to look into an issue related to resettlement by BMRCL [Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited]).
We create the managers who lead some of the most important business enterprises. Take just one industry as an example, fast-moving consumer goods. IIMB alums head Indian giants like Marico as well as MNC Indian subsidiaries like Colgate Palmolive India.
Increasingly, we are making significant contributions to the entrepreneurial pool who are building the businesses of tomorrow – e.g. IIMB alumni form the core of the founding team of Delhivery, which is an outstanding logistics company supporting e-commerce giants.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/from-setting-up-campus-to-being-top-ranked-iimb-director-rishikesha-t-krishnan-reflects-on-institutes-50-year-journey-8979815/,education

However, the final NCF document that was released by the Education Ministry on August 23, which was finalised after considering inputs from all 25 focus groups, makes no mention of introducing India as ‘Bharat’ in school textbooks.

Global Teacher Prize 2023: West Bengal teacher among top 10 finalists,The Global Teacher Prize is open to working teachers who teach children who are in compulsory schooling or are between the ages of five and eighteen.,"Deep Narayan Nayak, a teacher from West Bengal, has been announced as a top 10 finalist from across 130 countries in the USD 1 million Global Teacher Prize 2023.
Deep Narayan, from Tilka Manjhi Adivasi Free Primary School in Jamuria, Asansol, earned the title of “Teacher of the Streets” during the COVID-19 lockdown, when he moved classrooms outside and helped bridge the digital divide for disadvantaged children living below the poverty line in remote communities, empowering those with learning disabilities, counselling students and their parents, and improving literacy rates among adult learners.
Now in its eighth year, the annual prize is organised by the UK-based Varkey Foundation in collaboration with UNESCO and in strategic partnership with Dubai Cares, a UAE-based global philanthropic organisation.
“Inspirational teachers such as Deep Narayan deserve recognition for their commitments to preparing children and youth to navigate a rapidly evolving world. Teachers play a leading role in transforming education for the future,” said Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director General for Education at UNESCO. The prize was created to recognise an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in society.
Deep Narayan Nayak made the cut for developing innovative teaching methods that have transformed the lives of underprivileged children facing educational and social challenges. Amidst the pandemic, he turned mud walls into blackboards and roads into classrooms, bridging the digital divide for marginalised students.
His focus on educating parents, eradicating superstitions, and addressing learning disabilities has empowered both children and communities.
“Teaching is not only about sharing knowledge; it also includes playing a pivotal role in guiding children and youth towards a path of lifelong learning, empowering them to make an impact within their communities and countries and driving the future of humanity by becoming global citizens. We congratulate the teachers who have earned a place in the top 10 list of the Global Teacher Prize 2023,” said Dr Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer and Vice-Chairman of Dubai Cares.

“Making it this far is a reflection of your commitment, hard work and dedication to your profession. As a strong advocate of the role of teachers in driving human development, Dubai Cares looks forward to celebrating this noble profession at the Global Teacher Prize ceremony in Paris,” he said.
The Global Teacher Prize is open to working teachers who teach children who are in compulsory schooling or are between the ages of five and eighteen.
Teachers in the running for the prize must spend at least 10 hours per week teaching and plan to remain in the profession for the next five years. It is open to teachers in every kind of school and, subject to local laws, in every country in the world.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/global-teacher-prize-2023-west-bengal-teacher-among-top-10-finalists-8999175/,education

"Hefty rents, living in cramped space: Indian students in UK struggle for accommodation amid increase in visa fee","As more Indian students head to the UK to pursue their study abroad dreams, the increasing crisis of student accommodation is posing as a major challenge. Indian students in the UK and experts share their insights.","The number of Indian students in the United Kingdom has been increasing in the past few years. As per the data made available by the Union government, in 2022, a total of 55,465 Indian students were in the UK on a student visa.
Additionally, the Home Office, the Government of the UK announced that a total of 1,42,848 student visas were granted to Indian nationals in June 2023.

“I still remember the time when I got new accommodation and all I had left was £30 with me for the next two weeks. I was eating the leftover food of others whom I was living with, and some days there won’t be anything to eat. Since I was wasting time searching for accommodation, I couldn’t get a job, and nobody wanted to hire a part-timer as well. Later, I got a job in an Indian restaurant where I worked for nearly a year,” he said. Arun now works as a healthcare assistant.

While Arun faced this issue three years ago, when the Covid pandemic had taken over the world, the situation has not improved even now when the world is slowly moving towards normalcy. Simran Helal, who started a degree in MA Advertising and Marketing from the University of Leeds this September, says that it took her nearly half a year to find the right accommodation in the UK.

“I started looking for accommodation in April, with plans to move to the UK in September. This gave me approximately five months to carefully plan and select my living arrangements for the upcoming year. Despite initially thinking, I had ample time to research crucial factors such as safety, proximity to my university, and convenience in terms of transportation and nearby supermarkets, I found myself mistaken,” Simran recalled.

She also shared that one of the biggest issues she faced was booking the house once she found the apt accommodation. As many international students arrive in the UK each year, the competition for finding the right house has become stiff.
“Houses that I would shortlist would be let out within minutes. I took proactive measures by joining several WhatsApp and Facebook groups and consistently posting ads outlining my requirements on numerous housing websites. If you’re not swiftly engaged with letting agents on a daily basis, then you’ll end up living on streets in the UK,” Simran said.

Meanwhile, the struggle to find the right accommodation doesn’t end here. Many complained that they faced problems while paying their deposit. “Many student accommodations in the UK require a UK-based guarantor who is a local resident, working full time. Not all students aspiring to study in the UK may have access to such a guarantor, and I found myself in the same situation. In such cases, students are often required to pay the entire tenancy rent upfront, which can be a significant financial burden, particularly for those who rely on part-time work to cover their rent,” Simran added.

The problem has also been addressed by HEPI, the UK’s independent think tank devoted to higher education. In a blog by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI), Unipol chief executive Martin Blakey claimed that 29,048 new student rooms were created across the UK in 2020, but this year it decreased to 13,543 and some of those were old buildings being brought back into use.

Locals v/s students
There are some cities such as Swansea, Lincoln etc which are known to have more student population and also have specialised agencies that help students find accommodation. However, some international students are claiming that locals in these places are hesitant about renting out to the young population.
“Most homeowners prefer working individuals over students. They are also hesitant to rent their houses to Asians because they believe our cooking style makes their kitchens unhygienic,” Philip V Lobo, who recently graduated from Swansea University, Wales shared his experience.

Recently, some local reports from Edinburgh also highlighted that several people in Canonmills were protesting against the plans for constructing a large student accommodation. The protesters claimed that the district was already facing a housing crisis and that constructing a purpose-built student accommodation would not solve the student housing crisis as they would not be able to afford such high rents.
While these are stories that can be heard by a lot more students too, experts believe that such scenarios can dampen the charm of studying in the UK that is often portrayed by study abroad agents and on social media. “Limited housing options may result in Indian students having to settle for lower-quality accommodation, which can affect their overall well-being and satisfaction with their study experience. This could potentially lead to a decline in the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for Indian students,” Saurabh Arora, CEO and founder of University Living said.

Can the UK housing crisis lead to a decline in the number of Indian students?
While existing Indian students in the UK are warning future study abroad aspirants about the accommodation rent and other such challenges, experts believe this will not demotivate Indian students.
“The current housing crisis in the United Kingdom is unlikely to prevent Indian students from pursuing their educational goals in the nation. Instead, they are more likely to adjust to the circumstances by actively seeking out a variety of housing possibilities. This proactive attitude displays their willingness to find acceptable housing even in difficult conditions. When it comes to adapting to new situations, Indian students are frequently resilient and inventive, making them well-prepared to negotiate the housing hurdles offered by the UK’s competitive property market,” Yatharth Gulati, co-founder of Rostrum Education said.

Other experts also believe that it majorly depends on the financial condition of each student, because if the student is in the position to afford an education loan or has financial assistance from their families or universities, those students would choose the UK for higher education due to the quality of education.
Increase in UK visa fee
Recently, the UK increased the visa fee (including for study visa) by nearly £127. Now, the revised visa application fee for a student visa is Rs 51,787. While applying for study visas has become a little more expensive now, this may not have any negative effect on the number of Indian students hoping to apply to UK universities.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, it may affect the total budget that an average Indian student puts aside for their study abroad plans. “The proposed increase in visa costs might significantly impact the overall expenses of international students studying in the UK. Visa fees represent a substantial part of the financial burden, and any hike in these fees could necessitate more careful budgeting by students,” Gulati added.

With the news of increase in visa fees, some students raised eyebrows on whether it is to demotivate the influx of international students in the UK. “The number of international students is increasing in the UK, and there might be a possibility that the British government increased the visa fees to ensure that the international population doesn’t cross the threshold in the country, as many locals have often complained about the increasing number of international students in their cities,” said a Liverpool based student on condition of anonymity.
However, experts have dismissed this fear and have also clarified that the increase in UK visa fees is not expected to directly impact the housing crisis as it is primarily driven by issues related to housing availability and affordability, while visa fees is a separate financial consideration for international students.
“Visa fees can be adjusted by the government to manage immigration, generate revenue, or offset administrative expenses associated with visa processing and compliance enforcement. Changes in visa fees are often the result of a complex set of policy decisions and economic factors, and they may affect applicants from various countries, not just international students,” Manisha Zaveri, joint managing director of Career Mosaic said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/heres-why-indian-students-in-uk-struggle-for-accommodation-8985248/,education

‘Explore other countries’: Experts advise as Canada partially halts visa services,"Every year, lakhs of Indian students head to Canada to pursue their study abroad dreams.

“I had completed all the necessary academic requirements, and everything seemed to be falling into place until the political tensions between India and Canada escalated. Many international students have been seen protesting as well regarding inflation and the housing crisis in Canada.

However, it’s essential to dispel this false belief and emphasise the truth that anyone can pass the NEET with constant effort and a thorough comprehension of the subjects.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/how-consistent-hard-work-and-concept-clarity-can-help-crack-neet-ug-2024-8990769/,education

"Life in an IIT | ‘IIT Jammu broadened my horizons,’ says BTech student","Rishika Ranyal, a 20-year old BTech in Mechanical Engineering student shares her life in the institute and how IIT has provided a ‘unique lens’ to see life. She is from Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir and is in her fifth semester now.","– Rishika Ranyal
A typical day at IIT Jammu involves a balance between rigorous academic commitments imbibed with personal growth. The classes start from 8 am or 9 am and then we go to labs after lunch, followed by self-study and group projects. 
We follow a dynamic routine that seeks to foster learning and personal development. It is sometimes hectic but that’s what we are trained for.
JEE preparation and shifting to IIT Jammu
I belong to the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir. It is quite near the actual line of control and there have been many instances where we experienced cross-border shelling and other disruptive activities that halted every student’s studies. There is also low awareness of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). I got to know about JEE through YouTube while checking some preparation material for my Class 12 exams.

I prepared for JEE Advanced through online learning material and my rank was 22630 (General). I did not go to Kota, but I did rely on online resources, especially YouTube to prepare for the JEE. The experience of self-studying was challenging but nevertheless rewarding.
I am the first in my family to get into an IIT in 2021. However, this year my brother cracked the GATE exam and he got into IIT Roorkee for MTech.
If I had not made it to the IIT, I would have explored other engineering institutions in India. I was determined to pursue engineering as a career path. However, I also had a plan C which was to get into one of the top colleges of Delhi University to pursue Physics. During my time, CUET was not introduced, so I could have applied for admission at DU on the basis of my Class 12 marks.

Transitioning from my hometown Poonch to IIT Jammu was initially challenging but empowering. I gained exposure to diverse cultures and perspectives. The exposure indeed broadened my outlook and helped me adapt. 
Our batch started with the online semester with Zoom calls and digital lectures. We came to know about our batchmates via online meets. However, in that mode also, we developed strong friendships with our peers. We would spend hours sitting in an online meet to know our friends, where they are from and their journey to the IIT.
Unique lens to view life
Being at IIT Jammu, I feel I am provided with a unique lens through which I view life. The exposure, rigorous education, and interaction with brilliant minds have enriched my thinking and problem-solving abilities.

I am part of Tinkerers Lab, Robotics Club and Career Development Service of IIT Jammu. The Tinkerer’s Lab is a 24/7, student-managed maker space of IIT Jammu which was established with the help of the Maker Bhavan Foundation. Tinkerers’ lab has opened broad perspectives of research, machines and technology to me. 
I used a 3D printer for the first time in my life in this lab and that was the most interesting thing I had done after entering college. From then on, the Tinkerer’s lab has been the best place to work for me on the whole campus.

In my free time, I enjoy learning extra skills via the internet that would help me in the future at the ground level. 
Also, there are great sports facilities at IIT Jammu, so whenever we feel, like we can go and play with our peers. Completing my sleep is also my top priority.
Prioritising and finding a rhythm
Managing clubs alongside studies can be demanding, but it is a rewarding experience. It is all about prioritising and finding a rhythm. During exams, we usually do not put ourselves to a lot of work for the clubs, rather we focus on our studies.

I have participated in inter-IIT competitions and fests, which are memorable experiences. These events foster healthy competition, collaboration, and unforgettable moments. 
This summer, I participated in the Invention Factory Program sponsored by the Maker Bhavan Foundation. It was a six-week internship opportunity where I along with 19 other students from different IITs and NITs had to invent something that could prove as a boon for society. 
ADVERTISEMENT
This initiative looked impossible but when you actually see the 10 patentable products being made after those six weeks, you start believing in the potential of the students and the efforts of the teachers who guided them in it. For me, it was an excellent opportunity to evolve as an engineer and go into the product development field. 
After completing my BTech at IIT Jammu, I plan to pursue my studies further or explore opportunities in the Mechanical Core. My goal is to make a meaningful contribution to my field.

Life at IIT Jammu has been transformative. Coming from a region with it was a significant shift. IIT introduced me to a world of opportunities and broadened my horizons. Now I have friends from almost every state and union territory of India and I have been taught by professors from different parts of the nation as well.

Indian diaspora body asks US admin to make changes in training programme for foreign students,Study Abroad: The suggested OPT changes are essential not only for retaining highly skilled STEM graduates within the United States but also for ensuring the nation's continued leadership in emerging technologies,"Asserting that there is a huge gap between graduating students and available H1B, an Indian diaspora body on Friday urged the Biden Administration to make changes in the Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme for foreign students.
The Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) in a letter to Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security said as a result of the gap, Indian students were missing out on the opportunity to contribute to the US industry.
The several changes suggested by FIIDS include an extension of the STEM OPT period from 24 months to 48 months for eligible students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields, an extension of the period for applying for OPT post-graduation from 60 days to 180 days and providing STEM degree holders with six times the chances of being selected in the H1B visa lottery compared to non-STEM degree holders.

“By doing so, we not only retain the talent that fuels our innovation but also sustain the economic benefits that these students bring to our nation,” Khanderao Kand, chief of Policy and Strategy, FIIDS, said in the letter.
“Given the evolving landscape of global technology and the increasing challenges posed in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, retaining highly skilled STEM talent within our borders is not just an economic imperative but a matter of national security,” Kand wrote in the letter.
“The National Security Agency (NSA) has highlighted a talent deficit in emerging technologies as a national security threat. Retaining US-trained STEM professionals is critical to establishing a competitive advantage in these areas. By extending the OPT period, providing extra H1B visa allocations, and increasing lottery chances, we can retain the talent that is vital for maintaining our technological edge and national security,” he added.

Noting that this initiative has a significant economic impact, Kand said foreign students contribute immensely to the US economy, bringing nearly USD 10 billion to the nation’s universities in terms of fees and expenses. They also enrich the US academic environment and foster cross-cultural understanding.

“Without the proposed rule changes, the dream of continuing their education and careers in the United States becomes increasingly difficult for these talented individuals. This uncertainty might lead them to explore educational opportunities in other countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and others, which would adversely impact US universities and our economy in the long run,” Kand said.
The suggested OPT changes are essential not only for retaining highly skilled STEM graduates within the United States but also for ensuring the nation’s continued leadership in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, he wrote.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indian-diaspora-body-asks-us-admin-to-make-changes-in-training-programme-for-foreign-students-8993303/,education

Innovative Teaching Methods in Indian Higher Education for Increasing Student Engagement,"At Manipal University Jaipur, we focus on experiential learning through research & projects and industry-based internships to make education effective, engaging and relevant.","Flexible, inclusive, and innovative teaching methods in the Indian education system are very much required to increase student engagement and improve overall learning outcomes. According to a survey, only 55% of students in a class are actively engaged in learning. Although this engagement level further took a blow with lockdowns during the Covid time.
According to a research paper published in Emerald Insight, engagement levels among students have been significantly affected by social isolation, uncertainties during the pandemic and their return to classrooms after almost two years of study-at from home. 
Remote learning could not retain students’ attention for longer, and virtual classes disconnected empathy between faculty and students. The findings of the study also stated that this disconnects due to absence of physical interaction between faculty and students further hampered student engagement.
In this scenario, there is an urgent need to innovate teaching methods to increase student engagement. In a one-to-one chat with Dr Nitu Bhatnagar (Registrar, Manipal University Jaipur), she said, “Student engagement is a crucial element of education. It improves the ability to retain information for a longer time. Students can analyse and interpret the learning better. Attentive classrooms make it manageable, improve commitment to education and reduce dropout rates significantly. At Manipal University Jaipur, we focus on experiential learning through research & projects and industry-based internships to make education effective, engaging and relevant.”
As per the NASSCOM Insights report in the FICCI-EYP Knowledge Report’ Higher Education in India: Vision 2047′, India is experiencing a clear demand-supply gap in the digitally skilled workforce. In 2020, India’s demand for employees with digital skills was around 8x the size of the available talent pool. By 2024, the market for a digitally skilled workforce is projected to become 20x the available talent pool. Demand for digital roles is rising at a CAGR of 19.23%, while the professionals with digital skills are growing only by 16-20%.
A study says that progressive teaching methods help to improve engagement and boost employability and, therefore, can support filling this void to prepare India for the Digital Era or Web 3.0.
Heeding the need, universities and the Indian government have taken several steps to implement innovative and effective teaching methods. NEP 2020 is one of India’s most noteworthy educational reforms, which aims to improve teaching methods at par with global standards and ensure the overall growth of students.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dr Nitu Bhatnagar believes, “Education should be fun, relevant and effective. It improves engagement and ensures the best learning outcomes. We organise various experiential learning exercises at MUJ to make education as engaging and effective as possible.”
Here are some recommended teaching methods to improve student’s engagement levels.
Flipped Classroom is a type of blended learning method. Students learn concepts at home through class recordings, live sessions, podcasts, etc., and practice at school.
Project-based Learning provides real-world experience. Students participate in practical projects, collaborate with a team and apply classroom learnings in a real workplace environment.
Peer Teaching and Mentoring is a type of collaborative learning. Students and teachers work and support each other, which helps with personal and academic development. This teaching method can be through various forms such as one-to-one, group, online, etc.
Gamification is an innovative teaching method with game elements like leaderboards, badges, point systems, etc., in a learning atmosphere to motivate learners. It improves students’ attention span, inspires them to continue their education and boosts learning outcomes.
Active Learning Strategies improve students’ engagement comparatively more than traditional methods. Examples are think-pair-share, experiential learning, cooperative learning, educational games, problem-based learning, peer instructions, role-playing, and more.
Technology Integration creates an equitable learning environment where students learn according to their pace. It is essential to develop digital skills and prepare for future job roles. Digital field trips, social media integration, gamification, creating digital content, reviewing and analysing web pages, live/recorded classes, etc., are ways to integrate tech into learning methods.
Flexible learning paths, reforms in assessment/evaluations, introduction of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary courses, dual programs, and guest lectures are crucial aspects to improve teaching methods.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dr Nitu Bhatnagar firmly believes in the magic of integrating experiential activities in pedagogy to improve engagement. She recalled Benjamin Franklin’s quote, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn,” to establish her viewpoint to improve teaching methods and make it engage and student-centric.
She said, “We at Manipal University, Jaipur, organise experiential activities and provide state-of-the-art infra and other opportunities for extra-curricular activities. MUJ offers world class indoor and outdoor sports facilities, health & fitness centres, 75+ students clubs and much more. Clubbing classroom learning with extra-curricular activities and experiential learning improves overall performance of the students in grades, and professional acumen.”
Another teaching method that’s trending these days, recognised by UNESCO and several universities globally, is the Ubuntu method of education. It originated in Africa and is based on the philosophy that ‘All humanity is connected.’ It is a humanist education method explored extensively in the International Review of Education – Journal of Lifelong Learning by UNESCO. The Ubuntu teaching method implies that if all students are treated well and similarly, their performance improves.
The evolution of technology, changing socio-economic metrics, the coronavirus pandemic and other reasons necessitated the need to innovate and implement effective teaching methods that connect, improve engagement and multiply productivity. Implementing these teaching methods in pedagogy can enhance leadership skills and better prepare students for the world. However, it is also essential to assess the available resources and upgrade them to implement suitable new-age teaching methods if required.
Let’s conclude with the wise words of Yong Zhao, “The new age survival skills are effective communication, critical-thinking skills, and curiosity. These are not optional but mandatory for all, not only for elites of the society.” Innovative teaching methods focusing on new-age skills and infotainment elements improve engagement and employability and boost the overall education system.

Why do students in Kota continue to opt for dummy schools? Is it dual burden?,"In Kota, posters of different dummy schools along with their rates are splashed across the city. Ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 dummy schools charge different rates depending on the boards they are affiliated with.","Riddhima is enrolled as a student of class 11 in a school in her hometown Gaya in Bihar. But she lives miles away in the coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan where she is preparing for JEE Advanced, the entrance exam for the IITs.
She is not alone. Scores of students preparing for engineering and medical entrance exams prefer to take admission to dummy schools so that they can focus solely on their preparation for the competitive exams.
They do not need to attend classes and can straightaway appear for board exams.

“Many students opt to take admission in a dummy school in their hometown so that they can go back home two months before the board exams. Coaching courses also end by then. Then two months are devoted to the board exams and then revision for the main goal — the entrance exams,” Riddhima said.
Harshvardhan from Roorkee, preparing for the medical entrance exam NEET, is also enrolled in a dummy school in his hometown. “There is no problem of attendance at the school and students are also not expected to appear in any internal exam,” he said.
In Kota, posters of different dummy schools along with their rates are splashed across the city. Ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 dummy schools charge different rates depending on the boards they are affiliated with.
Aspirants choose dummy schools keeping in mind the quota in medical and engineering institutes available for students from certain states. For example, candidates who have completed their class 11 and 12 education in Delhi are considered for seat quota in medical colleges of the national capital under the Delhi State Quota.

With the number of suicides among competitive exam aspirants in Kota hitting a record high this year, experts have warned against the concept of “dummy schools”, saying students staying away from regular schools early often struggle with restricted personality development and growth.
According to official figures, 23 students have died by suicide in Kota this year, the highest ever for the country’s coaching hub. Last year, the figure was 15.
“We have raised the issue of dummy schools with the government. This concept is really negative and the practice needs to be stopped.

“We have also seen that some students who have enrolled in dummy schools, crack the entrance exams but don’t get 75 per cent in board exams, which is a prerequisite for admission to IITs. Students are under a dual burden. Ideally, full-time coaching should start only after class 12,” OP Bunkar, the district collector of Kota said.
The issue was also flagged by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at a meeting called last month in the wake of the rising student suicides. He referred to dummy schools as “fake schools”.
He had said, “Students of classes 9 and 10 are enrolled in coaching institutes. You are committing a crime in a way. As if IIT is god. As soon as students come to coaching institutes, they are enrolled in fake schools.” “It is also the parents’ fault… Students are enrolled in dummy schools and they do not go to schools. They have the dual burden of clearing board exams and preparing for entrance exams,” Gehlot had said.
More than 2.5 lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for engineering and medical entrance exams. A packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness are among the common struggles of the students there.
In a recent interview, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also said that the issue of dummy schools cannot be ignored.

“Although the number of such students is not very high compared to the total number of students… but the time has come to have serious discussions and deliberations on the subject,” Pradhan had said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/why-do-kota-students-continue-to-opt-for-dummy-schools-is-it-dual-burden-jee-neet-8985074/,education

IIT-Kharagpur’s First Batch: ‘Our classes were held where freedom fighters were locked up’,"An electrical engineering (1951-55) alumnus, Narasimhan Venkatesan Patel (former member of the Railway Board) shares some interesting anecdotes about the faculty and how IIT-Kharagpur took special tutorials of students who appeared in Class 12 exams from different boards or syllabi.","(In this six-part series, indianexpress.com talks to alumni from the first batch of first-generation Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). They tell us about the admission process back then, academic pressure, campus life, and how they bonded with their fellow students and faculty).
The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur) was established in 1951 and is the oldest among all the IITs in the country. As the institute was set up in the Hijli detention camp of West Bengal, it has a link with the freedom fighters of India.
An electrical engineering (1951-55) alumnus, Narasimhan Venkatesan Patel (former member of the Railway Board) shares some interesting anecdotes about the faculty and how IIT-Kharagpur took special tutorials of students who appeared in Class 12 exams from different boards or syllabi.
“We mostly had classes in the old Hijlee Central Jail building in the first two years. A big hangar inside the compound served as the workshop. Our staff, some of whom had served in the prison administration as jailors, mentioned that our classrooms were the rooms where prisoners (many great freedom fighters) were locked up, and some were tortured and later died,” he told indianexpress.com.
First batches of IIT:  IIT Delhi | IIT Kanpur | IIT Madras | IIT Bombay | IIT Guwahati | IIT Roorkee
To bolster the country’s growth and make it self-reliant, the government started establishing IITs, IIMs and AIIMS. Like other IITs, the classes of the first batch commenced on a half-constructed campus.
“Since our hostel, Patel Hall, was half ready when the first year started, we had to share rooms. Interestingly, as there were differences in syllabus levels in different universities at intermediate science where students took admission, tutorials of Math and English were organised after dinner in the hostel for the first two terms of the first year,” Patel said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The initial struggles and our saviour
IIT Kharagpur campus was spread over 2100 acres in the vast tree-laden campus. Along with a tough syllabus, the initial batches had to struggle with wildlife. “There were snakes around the hostel under construction and our beloved director Dr JC Ghosh, also a famed Indian scientist, ordered the cutting of drains around and spraying of carbolic acid. The humane and kind approach of Dr JC Ghosh made us withstand many hardships. In the third year, we moved to the classes in the new building,” he said.
DR JC Ghosh left IIT in the third year to join as the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. A student delegation from IIT met Dr BC Roy the then chief minister of West Bengal to plead with him the need for continuing Dr JC Ghosh, revered as a father figure by the students. DR BC Roy is stated to have quipped: “We will send another father figure to you.”

DR BR Sengupta, principal of Shibpur Engineering College was appointed as the next director for IIT Kharagpur. As per Patel, Dr Sen Gupta was a strict disciplinarian and a stickler for targets.

Despite being the first batch, the students, as per Patel, were fortunate to have the best faculty possible. “Dr Krause Mech Engg, Prof Malonowsky, Production Technology (UNESCO support) on the mechanical side and Prof Keshav Murthy, Prof Srinivasan, Dr Menon gave us deep insights into electrical engineering. They took us to much higher heights in the subjects that I could see the difference in when I joined DVC as an assistant engineer in the Maithon Hydel Project after college in 1955 and Indian Railways in early 1957,” Patel informed.
‘IITs should consider dual degree programmes’
These days, IITs are coming up with courses to skill up their students. In IIT Kharagpur, however, this has been introduced in the initial years. “One noteworthy feature of the course was the attempt to include Humanities in the course and we had the benefit of Business Management courses in two terms by Prof Nanjundiah. If IIT had allowed more courses in business administration, it would have sent the right mix of engineer managers to the industry,” Patel added.
On the issue of regular engineers drifting from core subjects to computer sciences, he said the problem is similar to losing engineering graduates seeking IIM post graduate pursuit “sometimes ending up selling cigarettes and soaps with lucrative emoluments.”
“One way would be to send out core engineers with a Diploma in Computer Sciences as well, IITs may consider shifting to dual degree programmes. AIIMS Delhi has already set up a strong IT department recognising the importance of IT in genetics health care,” he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-kharagpurs-first-batch-our-classes-were-held-in-where-freedom-fighters-were-locked-up-jeemain-2024-advanced-8969298/,education

"CAT 2023: Importance of time management, mock tests planning, topper traits",CAT 2023 admit card release date is October 25. CAT 2023 is set to be held on November 26.,"– Amit Poddar
Be it social media or academics, we can always learn from the people who have made it big and have dared to dream. So, come CAT 2023 and the aspirants need the dose of motivation and the right strategy to crack the exam and get to their dream B Schools. Let us look at what Common Admission Test toppers say about the preparation strategy.
Manage the pressure
It is the ‘D-Day’ pressure that may be the culprit in most cases, so a calm mind holds the key to success. We have seen even top players falter under pressure — be it cricket, football or any other sport. Handling pressure and enjoying the journey throughout the exam duration can help aspirants maximise their CAT scores. 
Time management
Divide the time judiciously while attempting the CAT 2023 paper. In the VARC section, know what works for you the best and follow that strategy. You can attempt VA first and then RC or RC first and then VA or it can also be a jump from RC to VA and then back to RC. The point is you need to do what works the best for you as a unique individual. Try different strategies in the AIMCATs and SAMCATs (mocks) and then figure out your plan of action.

Never give up attitude
There are quite a few aspirants -almost every year- who were not able to solve even a single set in the first 15 minutes of the paper in the DILR section and they became IIM call getters later on just because they didn’t give up even after losing the precious 15 minutes. The key was how to now utilise the next 25 minutes of the time left(you get 40 minutes per section in the exam). By getting 2 sets correct in the leftover time students were able to get past the 95%ile bracket needed to get good calls.
Mock test planning
In the remaining days, the focus must be on taking tests and analysing them thoroughly. Giving a gap of two and three days between the mocks can give the aspirants the much-needed time to plan for the next mock by working on all the mistakes done in the previous one. Going back to the basic booklets to review concepts can be really enlightening in improving the scores and thereby the percentile. 
ADVERTISEMENT
If some particular topic is still weak, one can try taking the sectional tests based on the specific topics as to strengthen that particular area like para jumble, para completion, geometry, critical reasoning, probability, etc. 
Mock test analysis
Analysing the paper is a tedious process but whosoever does it gets the real benefits. Once the mock test is over and you get to see your paper, try to attempt the leftover questions (the unattempted ones). Once you reattempt the paper, check the keys and mark all the wrong answers you got. Check the relevant chapters and rectify all the mistakes done. In a way you are attempting the same mock three times. This kind of effort never goes in vain and all the top IIM call getters can vouch for this.
Learn from the mistakes
In November, the frequency of tests can be further increased, but what is more important is to learn from the mistakes done. You should always check the difference between your answer and the actual answer. Figure out ways to avoid the mistakes by working on both the knowledge level and skills. Silly mistakes should be avoided at any cost as those mistakes are not done because you don’t know the answer but because you are in a hurry or because of some concentration lapses.
Keep motivating yourself!

"Appearing Class 10, 12 board exams twice a year won’t be mandatory: Dharmendra Pradhan","'If any student feels that he is completely prepared and is satisfied with the score in the first set of exams, he can choose not to appear for the next exams. Nothing will be mandatory,' pradhan said.","Appearing for class 10 and 12 board exams twice a year will not be mandatory for students and the option is being introduced to reduce stress caused by the fear of single opportunity, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.
Pradhan said the issue of ‘dummy schools’ cannot be ignored and the time has come to have a serious discussion about it.
“The students will have the option of appearing for the (class 10 and 12 board) exams twice a year just like engineering entrance exam JEE. They can choose the best score… but it will be completely optional, no compulsion.
“The students often get stressed thinking they lost a year, their chance is gone or could have performed better… the option is being introduced to reduce the stress caused by the fear of single opportunity,” Pradhan said.

“If any student feels that he is completely prepared and is satisfied with the score in the first set of exams, he can choose not to appear for the next exams. Nothing will be mandatory,” he added.
According to the New Curriculum Framework (NCF) announced by the Ministry of Education in August, board examinations will be held twice a year to ensure that students have enough time and opportunity to perform well and get an option to retain the best score.
Pradhan said he has received positive feedback from students on the plan to conduct board exams twice a year.
“I met students after the New Curriculum Framework (NCF) was announced. They have appreciated this and are happy with the idea. We are trying that the exams are conducted twice a year from 2024 itself,” he said.
Asked about the record student suicides in Rajasthan’s Kota this year, the minister said, “It is a very sensitive issue. No lives should be lost… they are our children. It is our collective responsibility to ensure the students are stress-free.” Over two lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.

According to official figures, 23 students committed suicide in Kota this year — the highest ever for the country’s coaching hub. Last year, the figure was 15.
Pradhan said the time has come to have a serious discussion on the issue of ‘dummy schools’.

“The issue cannot be ignored. Although the number of such students is not very high as compared to the total number of students… the time has come to have serious discussions and deliberations on the subject,” he said.

The minister said the Centre is working towards ensuring that students do not require coaching.
Several NEET and JEE aspirants enrol themselves in schools in their home states and move to Kota to attend coaching classes. They do not attend fulltime schools and directly appear for the board exams.
The issue of ‘dummy schools’ has been flagged by several experts who believe not attending school hinders students’ personal growth and they often feel isolated and stressed.
Asked why the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) hasn’t met in the last three years, Pradhan said, “CABE is being reconstituted”.
“The older version of CABE was very broad… demands of today’s education system are different. At a time when we are making a paradigm shift with the new National Education Policy, CABE also needs to be remodelled.

“At the end of the day, CABE will review what is being introduced now, be it new curriculum, new credit framework, accreditation or any other reform,” he said.
The minister further said two IITs — Delhi and Madras — are in progressive stages of setting up their offshore campuses and talks are on with several other countries who have expressed interest.

“The Ministry of External Affairs is coordinating it and various kinds of options and combinations are being deliberated upon. (External Affairs) Minister (S) Jaishankar himself is looking into it. I am also with him,” Pradhan said.
He said the guidelines for foreign universities to set up their campuses in India are also under deliberation and will be notified soon.

“We are going to make a paradigm shift. So, we will go ahead after exploring all possibilities and clearing all doubts. The guidelines are under deliberation and I am confident that the UGC will notify them soon,” he said.
Asked about the decision of states like Karnataka and West Bengal not to implement the National Education Policy (NEP), Pradhan said, “Their objections are not academic but political.” “I have still not been able to understand what their actual objection is about. West Bengal has taken out an alternative document. We have seen that and it is 99 per cent similar to the NEP,” he said.
He said both education and skill development ministries are working together to nurture a generation of learners who are equipped with the right skills to thrive in a 21st-century workplace.
“To achieve this, we are creating synergy between education and skills to provide students with both academic and practical skills. Today, there are close to 1,000 skill hubs with one lakh candidates enrolled in them. Going forward, we plan to set up 5,000 such centres,” said Pradhan, who is also the Skill Development minister.

"‘Diversity and range of the IIT system sets a student apart,’ writes IIT-Guwahati professor","""Classroom teaching alone does not shape the body and mind of an individual who wishes to grow through intellectual pursuit. Sports, music and other forms of entertainment also contribute to the growth of personality,"" writes Chattopadhyay.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
—Arun Chattopadhyay
The diversity and the ethos of the IIT ecosystem allow a student to flourish, no matter the discipline they choose.
The scale of diversity in IITs is unique in the academic world. For the students, classmates represent widely diverse appearances, behaviours, economic and social backgrounds, languages, accents, food habits and culture. So, it is natural for one to face a world of difference upon arrival in the campus.
However, this environment brings the opportunity to appreciate the strength of others and learn to live and communicate with contrasting neighbours. The teachers are not only different from each other in the way they appear but also in the manner they speak, teach and care for the students.
In an IIT, students are challenged by teachers and also their peers. In turn, teachers are challenged by students and their colleagues in the faculty. This kind of symbiotic relationship provides the students with options for knowing their place in a highly competitive world and growing up to be a better person.
Once, an engineering undergraduate student was particularly stressed with his future plans. He loved humanities more than his engineering or science subjects. His father was visiting him. We three had discussions over a long walk where I emphasised the importance of his freedom over parental ambitions. Recently, he wrote me an email about how happy he was in achieving a personal milestone of publishing his first novel.

Interestingly, IIT students cooperate to compete with their colleagues. In hostels, during events, and even on the roads of the campus at night, we can see that they are trying to learn and prepare for the next examination. The exercises help them prepare for the greater world of independent careers. Networking with seniors and alumni contributes to their prosperity in a connected world.

Classroom teaching alone does not shape the body and mind of an individual who wishes to grow through intellectual pursuit. Sports, music, yoga, meditation and interactions with successful individuals contribute to the growth of personality. I once observed a PhD student pursuing yoga and religion during her studies. She is now a professor and teaches yoga and religious practices independently.
In the IITs, there will always be someone who knows more than you; the environment itself makes the students humble. Eventually, these students also develop mature social skills that become valuable to lead institutions and corporates.
An undergraduate student may attend classes of up to fifty different teachers who teach a wide variety of subjects. The majority of teachers have exposure to international academics. Thus, the culture at IITs prepares students for future international employments.
ADVERTISEMENT
At a point of time, IIT Guwahati had decided to open a branch of engineering where science subjects were as important as popular engineering ones. The admitted students were under pressure from peers in conventional branches. I had discussions with the students over a long period of time on how their strong science background while pursuing engineering may have transformative influence over their future prospects and society. A student wrote to me recently about how happy she was with her new job in an American multinational conglomerate where she has finally realized the potential of her specific undergraduate studies.
The diversity of the environment in the IITs continues to be their defining factor.

While handing over the probe to the CBI, the High Court had noted that if the documents presented by Kanungo, downloaded from the website, are genuine he should get admisson into his choicest institution of the country like IIT or NIT.
“But if the documents…are found to be not genuine, then it is to be found out how that same has been obtained by the petitioner, so that such mistakes cannot be done by the opposite parties in future,” the bench of Justices BR Sarangi and MS Raman had said on August 17.
Kanungo claimed he had secured a total score of 98.8810861 which was communicated to him through an e-mail.
“After receiving the above information, the petitioner became sure that he would be taking admission in the superior Colleges in India like IIT, NIT etc. and also became eligible to appear in the All India JEE (Advance) Entrance Examination, 2022,” the court had noted.

“So this fluctuation took away the right of the petitioner to appear in the JEE (Advanced) 2022 or to take admission into superior colleges like IIT, NIT, etc…Since in both the sessions, his score was more than 98 per cent…in the final result published by opposite party on August 7, 2022 showed a different result and, as such, there is gross manipulation of the result of the petitioner.

I study villages, cities and everything in between. I am pursuing a master’s degree in rural development through the Erasmus Mundus programme. As per the programme, students will get a joint degree from six universities — Ghent University, Belgium; L’Institut Agro (National Higher School of Agronomic, Agrifood, Horticultural and Landscape Sciences), France; Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany; University of Cordoba, Spain; University of Pisa, Italy and Slovak University of Agriculture, Nitra.
Life in a Foreign University: Pranesh Lavania with his Ghent cohort
Students have to choose a minimum of three universities and a maximum of six universities to study at. However, it becomes difficult to manage all six in a two year degree, so most students prefer four. I am currently in the last phase of my master’s and I am at L’Institut Agro Rennes-Angers. I came to France in August 2023 and will be completing my degree in July 2024.
I began my degree with Ghent University in Belgium where I studied between September 2022 and June 2023 then I was at Slovenská pol’nohospodárska univerzita v Nitre (Slovak University of Agriculture, Nitra) between June and July 2023 followed by my current institute at France. I even went to Poland for 15 days for one module.

My specialisation was in human rights and I even got a scholarship.
Erasmus Mundus programme
After completing my master’s in India, I was looking to pursue a PhD from abroad and I came across the Erasmus Mundus programme. I decided to pursue it not only because it is prestigious but an advanced master’s. The applications for programmes begin at different times, so one needs to keep checking the official website.
As per the rules, you apply for the programme and scholarship together and suppose 50 people are selected for the programme, the top 15 will get the scholarship. In order to apply for the same, you need to submit your transcripts, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, CV, professional paper or assignment paper explaining your research topic and more in 2000 words.

Life in a Foreign University: Pranesh Lavania with the Poland batch
The Erasmus Mundus programme has nearly 17 types of specialisation in rural development, my specialisation is society. Since I wanted to study regional development, I am also learning about agrarian change which studies the changing relationship in the agriculture sector. It deals with trade, supply, resources, land ownership, gender, power and more.
Europe is scenic
During my free time, I travel. Since I have a Schengen visa, I have travelled to countries that come under it. When I was in Belgium I travelled to The Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg, while in Slovakia, I travelled to Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Now, since I am in France, I am planning to visit Spain and Italy.
My experience of living in all four cities has been great. The cities are all cluster-free zones, pedestrian-friendly, well-maintained and accessible. There are many activities for students to keep them engaged like sports clubs, literary clubs, arts clubs, drama clubs and so much more. There are open markets on weekends, carnivals, escape room challenges and whatnot. Here carnivals are about food, cultural exchanges and games.

Living in Europe, I got to meet so many new people who shared their stories with me; the experience has been truly enriching. The place I really enjoyed living in was Warsaw. Even though I was there only for 15 days, it was still a great experience. Generally, European markets close at 6 pm, but in Warsaw the markets are open till 8 pm to 10 pm since it does not come under the Eurozone.

One of the best aspects of the Erasmus Mundus programme is we would get student dorms. There were different set-ups in each country. In Ghent, we had a common kitchen with a private room and washroom, while in Poland there was a studio apartment shared between two people. In Slovakia, we had different rooms but common washrooms and in France, it is an apartment unit with two separate rooms, common washrooms and a common area.
Similarly, with food, every place has a different setup. In Ghent, we used to cook breakfast and dinner and eat lunch in the cafeteria while in France, food is arranged from Monday to Friday while on weekends we have to cook.

Even before coming to Europe, I was quite independent. In India, at one given point I used to be submerged in one thing completely, when it was work it was only work and there was no time for other things. Moreover, there is no such concept as eight hours as most people have to shell out extra hours. But in Europe, work-life balance is maintained. Employees indulge in their hobbies and take out time for other things as well.
Learnings from Europe
Here people have to do everything on their own — from household chores to other day-to-day activities. Life here is more disciplined. You have to plan things much in advance, be it your professional or personal life. Things such as going out with friends and eating out also should be planned in advance, not spontaneously. Europeans work on a schedule and stick to their calendar.

From an education perspective, Europe is good and the tuition fee is not that high. It has been a wonderful experience for me. You learn so many new things, meet people and go through new experiences. But, people should prepare themselves well as it is no cakewalk, Here, not everyone knows English. Most countries are English language friendly as they understand that you are tourists but if you’re planning to stay for long, learn the local language, adapt to the lifestyle here and accept the culture of a place. You have to be open and learn and understand how the system works. There is a lot of uniqueness in each place.

"NMC notification on new medical colleges legally untenable, should be kept in abeyance: Tamil Nadu CM","The problem can be effectively addressed only by starting new medical colleges in backward areas, MK Stalin said.","A notification by the National Medical Commission (NMC) on restricting the opening of new medical colleges has created a “regressive scenario” and should be kept in abeyance, the Tamil Nadu government said on Wednesday.
Chief Minister M K Stalin urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to instruct the Union Health Ministry to keep the notification in abeyance and initiate a consultative process to address the matter.
“I wish to draw your kind attention to the regressive scenario created by the recent notification issued by the NMC to restrict the opening of new medical colleges. It has been notified by the NMC that after the academic year 2023-2024, the Letter of Permission for starting new medical colleges shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that the medical college shall follow the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that State/ UT.” This is a “direct encroachment” on the rights of all State governments and penalisation of those who have invested more in their public health infrastructure over the years, the CM said.

He said progressive states like Tamil Nadu have been strengthening their tertiary healthcare network for many decades, leading to ample availability of doctors and nurses, which he said has manifested in their better performance in terms of various health indicators.
“Chennai has emerged as the healthcare capital of India. In both public and private sectors, our skilled medical professionals have been able to successfully serve not only the people of Tamil Nadu but also of other states as well as other nations. This has generated a huge demand for quality health services and new institutions are absolutely necessary for us to cater to it in the future,” Stalin added.
“The criterion proposed for such restriction, higher doctor-population ratio at the state level as compared to the norms, is also not appropriate. Even when there is adequate availability of doctors at the state level, there are districts where their availability continues to be a persistent issue,” he said.

The problem can be effectively addressed only by starting new medical colleges in backward areas and any restriction based on state level criteria will deprive these deserving districts of much needed tertiary institutions.

“I would also like to point out the fact that in states like Tamil Nadu which have a higher doctor-population ratio, such high availability of doctors has been achieved predominantly due to investments made by State Governments and the private sector and not by investments made by the Union Government.” “We have been continuously urging that the Union Government needs to contribute more but projects like AIIMS, Madurai are yet to take-off,” Stalin said.
Given this situation, a restriction on new institutions will completely eliminate any chance of TN getting new Central investments in health sector.
In a recent judgement, the Supreme Court also held that executive instructions could not impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental right to establish educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Thus, the above NMC notification may also be legally untenable. Considering all the above issues, I request you to instruct the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to keep this notification in abeyance and initiate a consultative process with the State Governments on the steps to address this issue,” Stalin told the PM.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/neet-nmc-notification-on-new-medical-colleges-legally-untenable-should-be-kept-in-abeyance-tamil-nadu-cm-8967807/,education

Fascination with science, engineering and robots were the main reasons I chose to be an engineer. I cracked the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in 2021 and chose Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore as I had an interest in physics, especially towards kinetic energy and the dynamic side of the subject.

Why India’s first STEM-focused liberal arts degree at IIT Bombay failed to take off,"In 2021, IIT Bombay announced an arts-science blended undergraduate programme -- a first in India. Two years later, the country's top engineering institute has realised there is still considerable distance to cover in terms of gaining acceptance for liberal arts in STEM. Here's why...","On June 28, 2021, IIT Bombay had announced a “completely new and novel type of undergraduate programme,” focused on “student choice and interdisciplinary studies.” The Liberal Arts-Sciences-Engineering (LASE) programme, with 30 seats, would provide students the opportunity to customise their coursework according to their interests and graduate with a Bachelor of Sciences or BS degree. It was a “liberal arts style offering in STEM” — a first in India.
Two years later, it hasn’t started — it couldn’t get even the minimum requirement of 10 students of a class of over 1,000 to sign up.

"No glorification of toppers, results of routine tests to be kept confidential: Rajasthan govt guidelines for coaching centres",Guidelines direct the institutes to decide the batches alphabetically instead of the students' ranks and not to shuffle and segregate them in the middle of the course based on performances in the weekly assessments.,"No glorification of toppers, results of routine tests to be kept confidential, no segregation of students in special batches based on their ranks and a policy for easy exit and refund within 120 days are among the recommendations made in the Rajasthan government’s guidelines for coaching institutes.
The nine-page guidelines have been issued days after the state government set up a 15-member committee headed by Education Secretary Bhawani Singh Detha to examine the issue after record student suicides were reported from coaching hub Kota.
The guidelines, which have been framed in consultation with the coaching institutes and other stakeholders, restrict institutes from encouraging students below Class 9 to take admission in coaching institutes to prepare for medical and engineering entrance exams.
Also read | ‘None of these measures by Kota authorities will help us’: JEE, NEET aspirants complain
“Coaching institutes should not encourage students below Class 9 to take admission. They should give admission after screening tests and counselling to assess their interest. If any registered student below Class 9 wants to leave, the institute should provide them a full refund in 120 days,” the guidelines state.
There is a set of other recommendations for institutes to ease mental pressure on the students such as facial recognition to prevent faking attendance, mandatory weekly holidays, not holding exams on the day after a holiday and a code of conduct for faculty and hostels.
District collectors have been asked to sensitise all stakeholders in their respective areas and ensure that the guidelines are followed.
This year has seen the highest number of student suicides — 23 so far — with two ending their lives within a gap of a few hours on August 27.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to official figures, 23 students have committed suicide in Kota this year, the highest ever for the country’s coaching hub. Last year, the figure was 15.
The guidelines state legal action will be taken against the coaching institutes found violating the code of conduct. The regulations also mention a monitoring cell for the institutes that will be set up in Kota and Sikar.
The cell will have data of all the students studying in coaching institutes through a dedicated portal, to be developed soon by the state government.
ADVERTISEMENT
The guidelines have a provision for “easy exit and refund policy” within 120 days if students and parents feel any inconvenience and uneasiness.
It also directs the institutes to decide the batches alphabetically instead of the students’ ranks and not to shuffle and segregate them in the middle of the course based on performances in the weekly assessments.
Read | Is IIT’s late night culture is affecting students’ mental health
The guidelines also instruct the coaching institutes to not publish the results of routine tests in public and they should counsel the students individually, keeping their marksheets confidential.
Additionally, the guidelines prohibit the glorification of toppers by coaching institutes.
The Rajasthan government drafted a bill in 2022 to prohibit institutes from glorifying the success of toppers but it was not tabled in the assembly.
ADVERTISEMENT
The new guidelines also include mandatory gatekeeper training for the teachers, institute managers, other staff, and the wardens of hostels and paying guest accommodations to assess the students’ behavioural changes and take preventive measures.
“A trilateral memorandum of understanding will be signed with the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), the state government and the people who daily communicate with the students such as coaching institutes and the hostel management for such training,” the guidelines say.
ADVERTISEMENT
The institutes have also been directed to appoint a sufficient number of professional psychiatrists and counsellors, who should be “recruited by NIMHANS or any psychology expert from a government medical college”, to keep a regular check on the students’ psychological health.
The students will also have to be counselled regularly. The first counselling should be done within 45 days of admission, followed by the second one after 90 days and the third one in 120 days.
ADVERTISEMENT
Vulnerable students assessed during the counselling sessions should be provided optional career counselling, it says.
Over 2.5 lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.
With the record spike in suicide cases, the administration has taken several steps, including mandating installation of an anti-hanging device in fans and ordering coaching institutes to not take any exam for two months.
The anti-hanging device installation has been encouraged by the Kota Hostel Association since 2017 and finally mandated by the district administration this year.
The device uses a spring mechanism — if an object weighing more than 20 kilogrammes is hung from the fan, the spring attached to it expands, making it impossible for someone to commit suicide. A siren also goes off simultaneously.
“Anti-suicide nets” are also being installed in balconies and lobbies of hostels in Kota to prevent students from taking any extreme step.
The police in Kota are also roping in wardens, mess workers and tiffin service providers to look for any signs of depression or stress in the students staying in hostels and paying guest accommodations.
While the wardens are being encouraged to participate actively in the “darwaze pe dastak (knock on door)” campaign, the police have urged the mess workers and tiffin service providers to report if a student is absent from the mess repeatedly and skips meals or anyone’s tiffin is found unconsumed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/kota-jee-main-neet-coaching-no-glorification-of-toppers-results-to-be-kept-confidential-new-guidelines-8962017/,education

"A lesson from IIT | Your engineering branches will matter less and less in the workplace of future, writes IIT Bombay professor","“We have not yet imagined the careers of the future. The best course of action, therefore, may be to continuously upgrade one’s skill set so that they may be used to address important moral and sociological issues facing humanity,” writes Santra.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Siddhartha Santra
Years after my graduation from IIT Kharagpur — 16 to be precise — here is a list of what five of my closest friends are: an IAS officer, a data-analytics entrepreneur, an engineering manager at Google, an expert mountaineer, and an executive director of financial engineering.
Let me tell you the branches they studied in random order: aerospace, civil, metallurgy, physics and mechanical engineering.
Here is a puzzle: Match the current jobs of my friends with their branches. Getting this right would make you among the less than 1 per cent (I tested it out with five people and only one got it right) of people likely to do so statistically.
But there is a reason I started off with this puzzle and it is to say that the branch of your undergraduate training often has little correlation with your long-term career.
Secondly, even those people who are regarded as successful in the long-run may not — and often do not — have a clear idea of their career path right from the outset.
Also Read | A Lesson from IIT | Why so many engineering students feel lost even after cracking tough entrance exams
The friends I have spoken of are fundamentally optimistic people who made the best of all life-choices, even the ones that were involuntary. In my opinion, therefore, fixating on branch choices and fretting about the “ideal branch” may be unnecessary. In fact, it may also be counterproductive even if the goal is a successful career as part of a happy life.

I would like to tell engineering first years that your primary emotion should be curiosity and enthusiasm. You should not be driven by anxiety and unhealthy competition.
Please take a large-canvas view of life, recognise your own spectacular achievement and appreciate the opportunities your new social and physical environment brings to you. Realise that the skills — of self-discipline, self-accountability and self-awareness — you pick up at IIT will remain with you long after you may have forgotten the details of your favourite course.
Most importantly, consider the branch of study as only the means to the bigger goal of your college experience.
ADVERTISEMENT
Also, please do not obsess over which IIT you join. Put your best foot forward wherever you go.
At most IITs, the academic structure allows students to pursue their interests across departments and fields. This can happen via a minor degree, cross-departmental projects, or simply via conversations and guided reading projects with a faculty in the student’s area of interest.
For example, all departments at IIT Bombay offer students from other departments an option to complete a mix of electives that can lead to a minor degree. So, we have students from a wide set of departments, ranging from CSE to mechanical engineering, who can get a minor degree in physics.
Students can also formally do their BTech projects with a co-supervisor from a different department. Alternatively, students can “audit” courses of their interest in any department, meaning they can learn about a topic by attending lectures without needing to take the exams.

You can also just approach a faculty member and have a conversation with them.
Your branch does not limit your pursuit of knowledge in any area.

It is hard to predict the specific technologies or skills that will be needed for jobs in a decade from now.
The future world will require experts in policies and technologies related to sustainability, circular economy, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, genetic-manipulation based therapies and quantum information processing, among others. Given that career trajectories in this age are so nonlinear. it may not be very useful to insist on an optimal choice for the branch of your college degree.
ADVERTISEMENT
We have not yet imagined the careers of the future. Thus, the best course of action may be to continuously upgrade one’s skill set so that they may be used to address important moral and sociological issues facing humanity.
I leave you with one more personal anecdote. Among the eleven of us who formed the graduating class of 2007 in physics from IIT Kharagpur, ten have gone on to have very successful careers that are not related to physics. As for the puzzle: the careers and branches were listed in corresponding order.

The chill in relations threatens to cast a shadow over SICI’s academic exchange programmes.
The impact is already visible: the abrupt suspension of visa processing services in Canada has compelled SICI to indefinitely postpone an agriculture conference in November for which it was expecting a delegation of Canadian scientists to visit India.

JNU teachers’ association alleges decline in proportion of women students,"There was no immediate reaction from the JNU administration on the ""state of the university"" report.","The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) has issued a “state of the university” report that alleged the admission system was in a “state of chaos” and flagged a decline in the proportion of women students.
There was no immediate reaction from the JNU administration to the report.
The JNUTA, in a statement, said the report lays bare the fact that the process of destruction of the university unleashed from 2016 has continued unabated, even after the change of the vice-chancellor in February 2022.
Read | While top 4 world universities (Oxford, MIT, Cambridge, Harvard) are led by women, Indian varsities have a long way to go
The proportion of women students in the university has declined sharply and continuously in the last few years, decisively reversing the previous trend of increase. The proportion and numbers of research students has also declined, the statement said.
“This destruction involves erosion of the institutional and academic ethos of the university and the undermining of its role as a promoter of social equity – the hallmarks of the university which were integral to establishing it as a premier higher education institution,” it added.
The academic expenditures which are critical for the teaching-learning and research processes in the university have seen a precipitous decline in the last few years, it said.

Alleging that JNU continues to function with the top-down model of university governance introduced during the tenure of the previous VC, the report said that chairpersons and deans continue to be appointed by the VC in “violation of the institutional norm of rotation by order of seniority”.

The teachers’ body also claimed that the meetings of statutory bodies like the academic and executive councils are conducted only online, are usually of very brief durations, and not to deliberate on issues but merely to rubber-stamp decisions already made.
“Flouting of statutory norms and undermining of the role of centres in the faculty recruitment process has become routine and several candidates have been denied a fair opportunity. Reservations in recruitment are also not being implemented properly with disproportionately large number of vacancies where no selection is made being ones where they are reserved,” it alleged.
The admission process is in a state of chaos and the university is operating with three different academic calendars because of the insistence on outsourcing entrance examinations to the National Testing Agency (NTA).

“Even though the promotion process did resume in 2022, several promotions of faculty have been arbitrarily kept pending and there is no sense of urgency in eliminating the huge backlog that exists. Legitimate rights are also being denied in the process of promotions and even many of promotions granted have involved such ‘sacrifices’,” the statement added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/jnu-teachers-association-alleges-decline-in-proportion-of-women-students-in-university-8952457/,education

"After Classes 5 and 8, Karnataka to conduct centralised annual examination for 9, 11","There will be no Karnataka board exams for the students of Classes 5, 8, 9 and Class 11, or first PUC, for the 2023-24 academic year. These students will take the annual exams.","In what is seen as a continuous and consistent assessment of the learning curve of students studying in the state board, the Karnataka government on Thursday issued an order allowing the Karnataka State Examination and Assessment Board (KSEAB) to conduct a centralized annual examination for Class 9 and first PUC students for the academic year 2023-24.
The decision to implement this comes at a time after the school education department has already introduced a similar examination for Class 5 and 8 students. As a result, Karnataka students studying state board syllabus in government, unaided, and aided schools and colleges, will have to mandatorily sit for Class 5, 8, 9 and first PUC examinations, effective from this academic year.
The move aims at keeping a consistent tab on the learning curve of the students at each level and help them improve their learning abilities. The school education department has also allayed the fears of detention in case of a student not clearing the examination.

As per the guidelines laid down by the state government, the question papers for Class 9 examination will be set by the Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council and the evaluation is set to happen at the taluk level.
For the first PUC examination, the question paper will be set by the pre-university (PU) board and the evaluation will take place at the college level. The schools and colleges will be treated as examination centers for both Class 9 and first PU examinations respectively.
For Class 9 examination, teachers from nearby schools will be appointed as room supervisors, while for the first PU examination, the respective college lecturers will be appointed as room supervisors. Following the evaluation of Class 9 and first PU examinations, the respective teachers/principals are directed to upload the results immediately on SATS (Students Achievement Track System).
The guidelines also state that for Class 9 examination, no student shall be detained in case he/she fails. In such a situation, the school is directed to inform only the student and the student’s parents about the results. However, for the first PUC examination, the board will be conducting a supplementary examination at the college level, if a student fails to get the passing mark.

A senior education official speaking to The Indian Express said, “The idea is to track, monitor and analyze the performance of students as they progress through higher levels of education. Many survey reports have indicated that as students progress to higher education, the learning achievement dips, especially in class 8, 9 and 10. Hence it is imperative that we improve the learning lacunae.”
It can also be recalled that, last academic year (2022-23) the school education department introduced annual examination for Class 5 and 8, after which landed the government in troubled waters.
Private school management associations had filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court seeking to quash the government order that mandated exams for Class 5 and 8, citing that it would pressurize and cause tension among students.
However, in March 2022 the division bench consisting of Justice G Narendar and Justice Ashok Kinagi allowed the government to conduct board exams for Class 5 and 8 students studying state board syllabus. The court also directed the government to confidentially inform the student who has failed and to give the student the necessary training and remedial classes to improve the learning skills, without detaining him/her. The court also directed the examination should contain questions within the syllabus and not outside the syllabus. Further, when the petitioners moved the Supreme Court on March 27, the apex court dismissed the petition and allowed the state to conduct the examination.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/karnataka-board-class-5-8-9-11-students-to-appear-for-annual-exams-and-class-10-12-to-take-board-exams-8952430/,education

Maharashtra: Schools with less than 20 students to be merged to create clusters,Many from the education sector have complained that the schemes are hinting that the government is shrugging the responsibility off its shoulders.,"The Maharashtra government has approved a new scheme of creating clusters of schools by merging multiple schools having enrolment of less than 20 students.
The idea is to combine them and create one big school wherein appropriate infrastructural can be provided to students along with a nurturing atmosphere with a great number of children in one campus encouraging healthy competition, sportsmanship and other aspects of holistic development of children.
The state’s Commissioner of Education Suraj Mandhare Thursday issued a detailed plan of action to implement the scheme.
The scheme is opposed by many from the education sector as the plan indicates closure of around 15,000 small schools.
Many from the sector believe that a large number of these schools are from inaccessible, hilly areas and closing them might lead to an increase in school drop-out from these areas, especially girls.
A big chunk of critical views also state that this scheme is directly opposite to the Right To Education (RTE) Act which mandates that a primary school should be made available within 1 km from the child’s residence and a secondary school, within 3 km.
“According to the parameters explained in the plan, the cluster school’s location should not be farther than 40 minutes in a bus, from the original school. This 40 minutes in rural or hilly areas is a long distance. Does the government expect a child to travel for 40 mins in a bus to attend school, in rural areas?” questioned Jalinder Sarode, Secretary from Shikshak Bharati, an association of teachers.
ADVERTISEMENT
He continued, “Kothari commission in the year 1968 had suggested a similar school complex scheme. And it was deemed unsuccessful. Now the state is planning to bring it back under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This will have a huge adverse impact on basic school level education offered by the state through government schools in rural areas.”
In the letter, Mandhare said, “The objective of the scheme is to not close down government schools. It is to strengthen them by ensuring that all schools are provided with adequate infrastructural facilities and raising the quality of education imparted at the government school by providing opportunities of holistic personality developments.”
There are over 1.10 lakh schools in the state of which around 65,000 are run by the government.
As per the UDISE data, there are a total of 14,783 schools have less than 20 students enrolled with them. Many of these schools, according to the plan, have either one or two teachers and lack other infrastructure.
Government is already running a pilot of cluster schools in Panshet from Pune district and in Toranmal of Nandurbar district.
ADVERTISEMENT
The letter issued by the commissioner asks all local administrations to submit proposals for creating clusters of schools from their respective jurisdictions, based on the same model of pilot project.
As per the UDISE data, with the new scheme of cluster of schools, 1,85,467 students studying in these schools and 29,707 teachers will be replaced as the mergers begin.
Recently, Maharashtra had approved the scheme of adoption of government-run schools by NGOs or individuals to ensure better infrastructural support at all schools.

A Lesson from IIT | Why so many engineering students feel lost even after cracking tough entrance exams,Topping entrance exams requires the mindset of an Olympic Athlete. But success in University education needs the mindset of an Explorer.,"(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Mohan Raghavan
This is the time of the year when scores of students enter the hallowed portals of universities after cracking the toughest exams. Walking in with a sense of pride, the euphoria often dissipates, leading to dejection, disappointment or a feeling of being lost. Students who were stars in their own schools feel their stardom crumble. To some extent, this is understandable and inevitable as the bar is set several notches higher with so many bright minds around.
Some revel in this new setting and do well. Most find a way to stay afloat, sail through, clutching at dreams of “getting placed” and ending this academic drudgery. A few are unable to adjust and fall into the trap of hopelessness. However, the vast majority of survivors go through the motions, fumbling from course to course, semester to semester, and internship to placement.
This could account for up to eighty per cent of the student population. Many of them go through their entire graduation without an idea why they struggle or feel lost. To understand one of the major reasons why this happens, let us look at two examples — an athlete preparing for the Olympics and an explorer in the forest.

The athlete has a clear task in front. Reach the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible. The team of coaches and support staff take care of every aspect of the athletes’ preparation, via training, strength endurance, strategy, competitor analysis, schedule, mental toughness, diet, shoes, dress and equipment.
While the athlete’s success depends on talent, the quality of the training team, hard work, dedication and following the prescribed regimen of the coaches are paramount. However, this is a passive process where the athlete must submit to the system and the system shapes and powers the worthy ones to glory.
Now, consider an explorer in a forest or a mountain. The end goal is not always clear and variable. Some want to scale the mountain peak, others explore the cave, yet others look to spot tigers and elephants. Even if the goal is known, there are no clear set of steps or regimen to achieve the goal. The coaches can teach the explorers skills to survive in a forest or snowy mountains, climb rocks, swim, read maps, navigate and hunt. They prepare the explorer to respond well to a variety of situations, However, in the forest, explorers must use the skills learnt to create their own maps, strategies or maps, handle uncertainties, make contingency plans and navigate by themselves.
ADVERTISEMENT
The life of a student preparing for the entrance exams is like that of the athlete. The coaching centres prepare the student for the photo finish and the student needs to follow the regimen with a lot of hard work and dedication. After clearing the exams, these champion athletes enter universities. They subconsciously believe that this is one more race and look around for the new set of coaches, instruction manual and a regimented environment.
However, universities, industries and life in the real world are more like forests; students and faculty alike are explorers. Every new course gives students a perspective about one part of the dense forest or teaches them an essential skill.
But the students are still hoping to be given a memo on “what they are supposed to do next”. That question can never be answered. Now the students turn to seniors, hostel mates and assorted friends for “a tip”; to figure out “how to ace this course ?”, “Which courses are better for getting a high CGPA?”, “Which courses are helpful in internship or placement interviews.” They hope against hope for the old regimen and an imaginary finish line. Most importantly they are in a tearing hurry to reach there.
A more effective way to deal with this sojourn could be to think of every lesson or concept as one piece of a jigsaw puzzle. This piece must be put together with the other pieces that have come and will continue to come through the years. As time goes by, you now have more and more pieces of the jigsaw fall in place and you have your own map of the forest. Now you know how to get to where you like. You now make your own plans, routes, regimens, and explorations and make it back safe too. You now have an instinctive understanding of the subject which once seemed like a forest. Those who continue to look for regimented instruction manuals tend to store every single piece of jigsaw very safely in a cupboard. They have all the pieces, but they only have information and no knowledge. When the first few pieces of the jigsaw are given, naturally, one cannot find any pieces that mate. This is the main reason many people feel lost in the early years. Many give up too fast on matching the pieces and just start accumulating the pieces. The ones who are curious keep wondering how the pieces are connected. Once they find a pair of matching pieces, they know it is possible. They start looking for more connections and are become engaged. They enjoy their study and are also naturally successful.

You’ve cleared the toughest exams to reach where you are. Obviously, you are the cream. Overnight you will not turn into dunces. If you feel lost, it only means that you are approaching it wrong. Waiting for the good old days to come back magically can be fatal. Higher education cannot be run like a hundred-meter dash. Seeking help and changing strategy early can make you the resounding success that you were always meant to be!

"‘Surviving on bread, fighting for refunds’: Indian students in Canada struggle to find housing, food, jobs","Housing and jobs continue to be a struggle for Indian students in Canada.

But when I reached my college in North Bay, Ontario, things were very different from what I had been told. Lack of housing and jobs, broken promises by local universities and what not. We have been deceived and sold a false dream, but we are still fighting and coming out stronger.

Discussions to setup IIT campus in UK underway: British officials,"'I know that quite a lot of UK institutions have talked to IITs about whether that would be a possibility. So again, it's not going to be happening tomorrow but I do think that's the trend for how the relationship will develop,' Smith said.","The UK is keen on welcoming an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) to set up an offshore campus in the country and some UK universities are already in talks with IITs to explore the possibility, according to top British government officials.
Several universities from the UK are also interested in setting up their branch campuses in India and are waiting for final regulatory framework from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to move formally in this regard, they said, adding with five UK universities having their campuses in Malaysia, the country has the expertise.
“Certainly, there has been a discussion about IITs setting up their campuses abroad. We have talked to the Indian High Commission in London because we think nothing would symbolise better the genuine two-way nature of the relationship between the two countries than IITs or other top institutions in India deciding to set up campuses in the UK. So we are very open to that,” Steve Smith, International Education Champion of the UK government said.

“I know that quite a lot of UK institutions have talked to IITs about whether that would be a possibility. So again, it’s not going to be happening tomorrow but I do think that’s the trend for how the relationship will develop,” he added.
Smith is leading the largest-ever delegation of UK universities and education leaders, which is on a five-day visit to India to meet key stakeholders with discussions on internationalisation of higher education institutions through partnership, dual degrees and furthering research collaborations on the agenda.
Two IITs have already announced setting up their offshore campuses and have signed formal agreements in this regard. While IIT Madras is setting up its campus in Tanzania’s Zanzibar, IIT Delhi is setting up an offshore campus in Abu Dhabi.
Asked about whether UK universities are also exploring setting up their campuses in India, Smith said, “The simple answer is yes. There is a lot of interest. But of course, the thing you have to do is to have the regulatory framework sorted, because no governing body anywhere in the world would commit to that unless the regulatory framework was agreed, signed and sealed. So we have made major strides on getting to that situation in the last two or three years.” The University Grants Commission (UGC) had in January this year announced draft regulations for foreign universities to set up their campuses in India.

However, the final regulations have not been notified yet.
Alison Barrett, Director India, British Council, said, “I can assure you that while a lot of the universities are thinking about long-term physical presence, but again, we need to get everything finalised. So that there are no roadblocks. We are very interested in seeing that happen here and also of course, Indian institutions opening in the UK.” “We are very excited because the future is about genuine two-way partnerships. And thus, branch campuses, physical presences are very attractive to us. But again, once we have got the regulations and the UK has a lot of expertise in that area as well. If you look at Malaysia there are five UK universities that are very well established there. So there is a lot of expertise within the UK university network of doing that. Hence, they are really interested in this opportunity in India as well,” Barrett added.
The two officials, however, refused to divulge names of the universities exploring the collaborations in the two areas.
The delegation, coordinated by the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), arrived in India on Sunday. It includes representatives from 31 UK higher education institutions and bodies.

The delegation participated in the India-UK Higher Education Conference organised by the British Council on September 18 and 19 in Delhi. The discussions focused on transnational education and facilitating the expansion of higher education partnerships between the institutions from the two countries.
Barrett said improving the quality of education and internationalisation are a key part of the ongoing conversations. The delegation will also delve into transnational education and share insights into the scope and opportunities presented by the mutual recognition of qualifications and the foreign collaboration regulation of the UGC.

IP University Admissions 2023: Delhi LG approves admission to vacant seats,"IP University Admission 2023: The Delhi government has allowed CUET score to be considered as the admission criteria, so that all vacancies are filled. GGSIPU had submitted that the university has been admitting students in the relevant courses on the basis of CLAT (UG) till 2022-23.","IP University Admissions 2023: Delhi LG VK Saxena has approved the admission of students on the basis of the aggregate score of CUET against the seats that remained vacant after exhausting the complete merit list of CLAT (UG) in 2023-24 academic session in the five-year integrated law programmes of GGSIPU, Raj Niwas officials said on Tuesday.
In a file addressed to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the LG expressed his concern that his approval has been sought much after the commencement of academic session 2023-24 at IP University, thereby causing unnecessary harassment to aspiring students of these much sought after professional programmes, officials said.

Sources in the Delhi government said the LG’s comments on the admission to vacant seats were unfortunate. It is the Delhi government’s initiative that has prevented any vacancy in private colleges of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU).
“Many seats were left vacant as only CLAT scores were considered. This why it was decided that any remaining vacancies would be filled via CUET scores. This is being done for the first time by any university,” a source said.
The Delhi government has allowed CUET score to be considered as the admission criteria, so that all vacancies are filled, the source stressed. “It doesn’t suit the LG to try and take credit for efforts being made by an elected government. As a constitutional head, the LG should not be indulging in such practices of purloins of the credits,” the source said.
According to Raj Niwas officials, Saxena, who is also the Chancellor of the GGSIPU has approved admission of students on the basis of aggregate score of CUET in three subjects (English, Legal Studies and General Test) seats that have remained vacant after exhausting the complete merit list of CLAT (UG).
Raj Niwas officials said the LG approved the admission procedure keeping in view the larger interests of the students, but said that the proposal for regulating admission in BA, LL.B/BBA LL.B Programme in GGSIPU for the academic session 2023-24, has been submitted in the month of September, “causing inordinate delay in filling up the vacant seats in these courses”.

The LG, in his note, advised that to ensure timely processing of such proposals and to “avoid unnecessary delays” in the future to ensure timely commencement of academic activities.
The LG further directed to process future proposals related to regulation of admissions procedure through the Admission Regulatory Committee in terms of the provisions of Delhi Professionals Colleges Or Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee, Regulation of Admission, Fixation of Non-Exploitative Fee and other measures to ensure Equity and Excellence) Act, 2007, they said.
Under the provision of Section 4 of the said Act, an Admission Regulatory Commission has been notified on April 13, 2023 with the approval of Delhi LG. It has been provided in this section that the Admission Regulatory Committee shall regulate the procedure of admission in institutions and suggest the guidelines to the government, to ensure a fair, transparent, merit-based and non-exploitative procedure to be adopted by the government under the provisions of this Act.
GGSIPU had submitted that the university has been admitting students in the relevant courses on the basis of CLAT (UG) till 2022-23.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/ip-university-admissions-2023-delhi-lg-approves-admission-to-vacant-seats-8947949/,education

CUET Toppers’ Tips: ‘How I scored 100 percentile in all subjects and secured a seat at Miranda House’,"CUET Toppers' Tips: Patna girl Daksha Shrestha Singh was interested in English from an early age and for CUET UG preparation, referred to NCERT books as her primary source.","CUET UG: Daksha Shrestha Singh of Patna secured 100 percentile in all four subjects she appeared for in the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) UG 2023. Singh appeared for English, Economics, Political Science and History. She is currently pursuing BA English (Hons) from Miranda House, Delhi University. The 18-year-old completed her schooling from St Joseph’s Convent High School, ISC board with 97.25 per cent in her Class 12 board exams.
Daughter of a government employee and an English teacher, her rendezvous with the subject was through her mother who taught English to classes 11 and 12. She believes the reason she grew fond of the subjects at an early age is due to her mother. Indianexpress.com spoke to Daksha to find out how she secured full marks in all the subjects.
Why did you choose Delhi University?
I wanted to study at DU because of the academic environment I would get here, I wouldn’t get anywhere else in the country. Many of my seniors are studying in the DU colleges. They told me that the English faculty here is among the best in the country.
How did you prepare for CUET?
Since I was from the ISC board and CUET is based on NCERT, I had to study separately for my boards and separately for CUET. For my preparation, I joined Career Launcher which proved to be very helpful as they taught NCERT line by line, then there used to be MCQs and revision after every class and some compulsory mock tests to be solved in stipulated time. I solved all the mock tests provided by the coaching.
I also took mock tests from other sources and spoke to my seniors and asked them for tips and tricks to prepare for the exam.
What was the study schedule like?
I started my preparation when I was in school. I used to come back from school by 3 to 3:30 pm and then go to the coaching centre. The timing would vary. On some days, it used to be for three hours and on other days, it would be for one-and-a-half hours. After coaching I would study NCERT and then ISC books for my boards.
How was it preparing for your board exams and CUET simultaneously?
CBSE was easier for a few subjects while for the remaining ISCs was better. Economics had less theory than ISC but for history and political science, I felt CBSE is more relevant. CBSE English is much easier than ISC. It would definitely be better if CUET had questions from other boards as well.
What is your opinion on CUET and normalisation?
ADVERTISEMENT
I definitely think the older system was very redundant. As every board have its own marking system, it is difficult to assess the potential of students only on the basis of board exams. CUET is better than the previous system but it’s too early to say if it is the best alternative
For normalisation, I personally didn’t have to suffer, however, a few of my friends from the Commerce stream suffered a lot, losing somewhere around 50 to 60 marks.
What reference material did you use?
I referred to NCERT books as my primary source, and other resources from my coaching and for English I used only my ISC grammar book.
What would you do after graduation?
Once I graduate, I want to pursue English at the Master’s level. After that, whether I want to pursue it further or appear for civil service, is something I will decide later.
ADVERTISEMENT
What did you do for recreational purposes?
It’s important to have something to go back to. I really love reading so I would read a book either a new one or something that I have read multiple times. One of my all time favourites is ‘Resurrection’ by Leo Tolstoy.
What advice would you give to students who will appear for CUET?
Everyone must read NCERT line by line as that is where all the questions are from. Solve as many mock tests and MCQs as possible as it will get you familiar with the exam pattern.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cuet-toppers-tips-how-i-scored-100-percentile-in-all-subjects-and-secured-a-seat-at-dus-miranda-house-8929427/,education

‘Selling a false dream’: Indian students abroad open up about mental health issues,"A lot of Indian students who are studying in different parts of the world have complained that 'studying abroad' has become lonelier, especially since after the Covid-19 pandemic.","‘Study abroad journey portrayed as an ideal and enjoyable experience, often neglecting to convey the realistic aspects‘
‘They really oversell USA, UK and Canada’
‘Indian agents selling false dreams’
While the number of study abroad aspirants from India has seen an increase in the post pandemic world, is the condition getting better too?
As per a study conducted by authors from the University of Birmingham, King’s College London and Imperial College London, international postgraduate students had higher rates of depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal thoughts than the UK population, and very few of them sought help to fight it.
A lot of Indian students who are studying in different parts of the world — the US, the UK, Germany, Poland, Canada, Australia — have complained that ‘studying abroad’ has become lonelier, especially since after the Covid-19 pandemic.

Some researches have shown that university students, in particular, have experienced significant fear of the Covid-19 pandemic related to intolerance of uncertainty and a lack of quality of life related to the reduction of social contacts.
Arun Patric, a MSc supply chain management student who went to the UK in October 2020 told indianexpress.com that it was extremely difficult to adjust to the change that this shift in continents brought.
“Unlike how I was known in India, I am an introvert here. Life in the UK is tough because we are living inside a box. We wake up, go to university, do a part-time job (if you have one) and then come back to our small room; the cycle keeps repeating. It gets lonely a lot of times,” he said while adding that his cousin is also in the same country, who turned out to be a support system.

Morning coffee runs to happening club life — fake!
Study abroad students also complain that the image people paint on social media is a “rosy and fake one”. The life of an international student is usually shown as one filled with fancy university lectures, big libraries, great friend groups, parties and travelling around the world. However, students currently living their study abroad believe this is a built-up scenario to sell more dreams.
From morning coffee runs to a happening night life, study abroad students claim these rosy pictures are often not true. (Representative image. Source: Pexels)
“Life of study abroad students here is tough. You have to work part-time as the cost of living is extremely high. And it is hard to find jobs, be it full-time or part-time,” said Shilpa Pradeep, who is currently pursuing a PGD in Digital and Content Marketing from York University, Canada.
Post pandemic, the students abroad had to face multiple issues including higher rent. “I came to Germany towards the end of 2021 and while things were back to normal, it is still not easy. The rent went almost twice as high and because many locals returned to their country, the number of jobs for international students reduced,” *Kriti (name changed on demand) said.

Study abroad students also wish to break the “fake image” that people show on social media. Be it morning coffee runs or happening club life, the picture of studying abroad is usually shown as “straight out of a movie”, which is far from the truth, students said.

“Many people think that I might be ‘living my best life’ but the truth is that I am washing utensils or working in warehouses to make ends meet. I struggle to attend lectures in the day and finish up assignments waking up till 3 am to ensure I get a good grade, and all the cooking shenanigans are missed out too,” *Kriti added.
Study abroad students are also constantly anxious due to the uncertainty of living in a foreign land, especially after a period of the global pandemic, Ukraine-Russia war, floods and heatwaves in the US and more.
George Kuruvilla, who is currently pursuing his second masters in political science from Poland, shared how he could not return to India even when his father passed away. “You miss out on a lot of your family events and important days, and sometimes it is tough to be there for them on sad occasions too. When my father passed away, I could not travel back to India and my mother and younger brother handled everything back home. It’s been a few years and I have still not been able to meet them,” he shared.
‘Study abroad agents neglecting to convey realistic aspects’
Study abroad students have added that it is usually Indian agents who sell this picture to students. Arun Patric claims that if he had known the real struggles of living abroad as a student earlier, he may not have considered this as an option.

Endorsing with Patrick, Ramya added: “It’s evident that there is a tendency for Indian agents and people in general to portray studying abroad as an ideal and enjoyable experience, often neglecting to convey the realistic aspects. While the allure of a new adventure and personal growth is real, the portrayal can be skewed. The reality consists of demanding coursework, juggling of part-time on-campus jobs, mastering effective time management, balancing personal and academic commitments, building new friendships, and navigating through various challenges to keep your sanity in so much work.”

*Kriti also shared that when she met her study abroad agent, she was told that it would be too easy to find a part-time job, and that she would be able to pay off her study abroad loan through that. However, she has been unable to start paying off the loan as a lot of her earnings go into her daily expenses.
Online world — the new bane
The fact that a lot of the academic world is now online-based also further adds to the pressure on Indian students who have travelled across the world to get quality experience. “During my initial semester, I encountered significant mental health challenges and my personal life cycle was worse than I could have ever imagined. The transition to a new culture and country brought with it a host of difficulties. The competitiveness of my peers, unfamiliarity with the education system, and the complexity of the coursework all contributed to the unexpected stress I experienced,” said Ramya Tulasi Dega, who is pursuing MS Entrepreneurial Leadership from Texas A&M University, US.
Arun, too, recalls that when he started his study abroad experience in the UK in October 2020, things were mainly online. Even though the university was working in a hybrid mode, people were afraid of stepping out of their homes even for essentials, let alone for lectures. “Even though I tried going to the lectures, the empty university campus crept a sense of loneliness in me. By the time things went back to pre-pandemic normal, my course was over,” he recalled.

However, some study abroad students have also said that while the journey is hard, seeking help has worked out for them. Sabine Ameer went to the UK in September 2020 and had to take an extension of four months due to an injury.
“My injury made it almost impossible for me to write my dissertation and I had to take an extension. Due to this, I was facing some mental health issues, but my university, my GP (general practitioner), and my therapist helped me a lot. They made sure I had all the resources, support and motivation to get better. At the same time, I know someone who had a terrible accident but she did not receive the same kind of assistance in India. So, the fact that there is very little taboo around mental health in a few countries makes it a tad easier for Indian students abroad to rationalise the situation,” she said.

A lot of universities are also actively providing therapy to the students, which has come as a helpful tool. A study abroad student from the UK told indianexpress.com that she started seeking help from therapists available on-campus and that led to her grades increasing significantly.
“During the pandemic, I could not return to India and my mental health started taking a beating. Due to that, my grades started falling too, and that was when my teacher advised me to e-meet a therapist. I started attending free therapy sessions, which were being offered by my university at that time, and slowly I was able to get back to life. My grades increased, and so did my energy in a few months,” said *Radhika (name changed on request), who went to the UK in 2019.

"Potential artists, sportspersons take a backseat because of JEE preparation…Education is also about socio-emotional growth: IIT-Kanpur professor","“The convergent thinking that helped students crack JEE — and which also might help them get a 'good' career — can be too overwhelming,” writes Kumar Ravi Priya","Written by Kumar Ravi Priya
*(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)*
Recently, a first-year student stopped me after class and asked if he could discuss something with me.
“I was always interested in playing the tabla, but could not find time earlier. You know how the preparations for the JEE are! I have started practising again. I missed the joy of creating some tunes. Today, in your lecture on Carl Rogers’ theory of the self, I could see how creating beautiful rhythms seems to be a part of me,” he said.
Another student shared how he realised the gendered nature of the world. He contrasted his notions of well-being vis-à-vis that of a woman survivor of an earthquake in Marathwada who was compelled by her husband to undergo a surgical procedure to help her bear children again.

These are two of the many examples of conversations we have in our social science and humanities courses at the IITs. In contrast to science and engineering courses, these help students connect to their own experiences while drawing links to the world we live in.
But a question arises: Are most IIT students keen to engage with these conversations, especially with the pressure and challenges that come with internalised notions of securing the highest possible package?

Rebooting the human within
Like many other colleagues in the IITs, I have been experimenting with ways in which I can help students develop meaningful insights about the human and social world. Both students and teachers have to counter the effects of convergent thinking that the JEE preparation (particularly at the coaching centres) often instills in them.
Potential of being excellent debaters, artists, sportsmen, social workers and leaders within the students takes a back seat in our education system partly due to the nature of the school curriculum and the stress of the JEE preparation.
For some students, the dormant quest to learn about human and social realties reignites as they enter the IIT system. For others, the convergent thinking – that helped them crack JEE and thus might also help them get a “good” career – can be too overwhelming.
Here, it is also important to realise that education is defined in terms of socio-emotional growth rather than mere intellectual growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
Impact of Role Models
It is understandable that just as any other human being, students’ lives are also guided by several role models. In the IIT system, teachers, fellow students as well as alumni are the potential role models. They help students pursue their academic and personal goals.
One thing that can help reignite the quest to learn about human and social realties and develop insights about the self are the biographies of the former IITians.
I would like to mention two products of the IIT system. Mr Arvind Gupta (the toymaker) and Mr NR Narayan Murthy (Infosys founder). Their lives present some examples of how the critical questions concerning explorations about self (interest, passion or “who am I?”) as well as cultural or socio-political conditions surrounding our lives cannot be ignored while working toward a career.
Gupta, a 20-year-old engineer who studied at IIT Kanpur, worked with TELCO for some time. He soon started feeling dejected due to a lack of interest in his work.

He has spoken about recollecting the smile on his face as a child when he could play with his toys. He went on to recognise that his true interest or passion was in bringing such smiles to children by becoming a unique science educator who utilises toys and works with students in numerous schools of the country. He also broke the stereotype of only men being breadwinners for the house when he took care of his child at home while his wife worked as a teacher at Fergusson College in Pune.
Murthy is not only an example of an innovator and entrepreneur but also a leader of skilled personnel who has been critically aware of the cultural and socio-political contexts in which his organisations work. One of his favourite books, Black Skin, White Masks by Franz Fanon, makes one address the social hierarchies of race and class.
Rebooting the human within may contribute towards the well-being and self-growth of students at IITs during their student life and beyond. IITs as educational institutions present the opportunity for the students to work toward that along with the teachers, fellow students, and the vast alumni network.

UGC opposes plea in Delhi HC against CLAT-based admission to 5-year law course in DU,The Centre said in its response that DU was one of the premier central universities and has autonomous status in the management of its day-to-day affairs.,"CUET: The five-year law course is a professional degree programme which may require different yardsticks to select students for admission, the University Grants Commission told the Delhi High Court Tuesday in response to a petition against Delhi University’s decision to admit students to the course solely on the basis of CLAT-UG 2023 and not CUET.
UGC, in a counter affidavit filed in the matter, sought dismissal of the petition and said the DU, with the approval of its Academic Council and Executive Council, has resolved to admit students to its integrated law course through the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), a centralised national-level entrance test primarily adopted by the premier National Law Universities.
Read | CUET UG Participating Universities: Admissions at Central University of Tamil Nadu, top courses, scholarships and more
Similarly, the central government, which has earlier also stated that the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) was not mandatory for central universities, said admission standards for professional courses like engineering, medicine, law etc are shaped by their specialised nature and specific skill and so are needed to be guided by the distinct prerequisites of each course.
“While there are overarching policy guidelines, universities retain the flexibility through their Competent Bodies i.e. Academic Councils and Executive Councils to tailor these guidelines to suit the unique demands of such professional courses,” the Centre said in its reply to the matter.

“The National Education Policy (2020) also envisions governance of Higher Education lnstitutions by highly qualified independent Boards having academic and administrative autonomy…the relief as sought by the petitioner to quash the admission notice of University of Delhi may not be granted,” it said.
Last month, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Narula had asked the Centre and the UGC to file their detailed replies on the petition by Prince Singh after the Centre’s counsel said CUET was not mandatory for central universities but the UGC’s lawyer took a contrary stand.
“It may be pertinent to mention here that Five-Year Integrated Law programme is a professional degree programme, and different yardsticks in terms of assessment/evaluation may be required to select students for admission in this professional degree programme. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is most humbly prayed that this instant petition may be dismissed by this Hon’ble Court,” the affidavit filed by UGC said.

The Centre said in its response that DU was one of the premier central universities and has autonomous status in the management of its day-to-day affairs.
It stated that admission to its various professional courses and programmes are governed by DU’s own statutes, rules and ordinances etc.
Petitioner Prince Singh, a law student at Campus Law Centre in DU, has argued in his petition that the university, while issuing the impugned notification, has imposed a “wholly unreasonable and arbitrary condition” that the admission to five-year integrated law courses shall be solely based upon merit in the CLAT-UG 2023 result, which is violative of the right to equality under Article 14 and right to education under Article 21 of the Constitution.
The plea has said the condition lacks any intelligible differentia and has no rational nexus with the object of admission to the five-year integrated law courses at the Faculty of Law.
ADVERTISEMENT
The petition has sought that admissions to the five-year integrated law courses be done through the CUET- UG, 2023.
It has said CUET-UG 2023 was introduced by the Union Ministry of Education (MoE) for admission to all undergraduate programmes in central universities for academic session 2023-24.
Earlier this month, the high court had questioned DU’s decision to admit students to five-year integrated law courses solely on the basis of CLAT-UG, 2023.
The high court had said when other central universities were allowing admission for the course on the basis of CUET UG 2023 introduced by the Ministry of Education, Delhi University was “not special”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/ugc-opposes-plea-in-delhi-hc-against-clat-based-admission-to-5-year-law-course-in-du-cuet-ug-2024-8937683/,education

Kerala only state to include avoided portions by NCERT from school textbooks: State Education Minister,Sivankutty said the NEP 2020 has not been completely accepted in the country as Tamil Nadu has rejected it in entirety and Karnataka has only agreed to implement some portions of it.,"Kerala General Education Minister V Sivankutty has said that it is the only state in the country to compile all the portions avoided by the NCERT from school textbooks and create a new textbook for students to study and appear for exams.
He said that the government took such a stand in accordance with Kerala’s exemplary educational background.
He said this in response to a query in the state assembly from the UDF opposition with regard to implementation of the National Education Policy 2023.

Sivankutty said the policy has not been completely accepted in the country as Tamil Nadu has rejected it in entirety and Karnataka has only agreed to implement some portions of it.
Moreover, the National Council of Educational Research and Training has deleted a lot of things — like the assasination of Mahatma Gandhi and the alleged role of RSS in it, portions of the Mughal rule and empire in India, parts of Indian freedom struggle and some communal riots — from textbooks for classes 11 and 12, the minister claimed.

“So, we compiled all the deleted portions and created a new textbook. It is not a mere textbook, but a syllabus which students can study and take exams on,” he said.
The supplementary textbooks were released by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in August this year.

West Bengal Education Dep notifies new State Education Policy; retains existing pattern of school structure,The West Bengal Education department has issued the notification on Saturday which mooted the continuation of the state's 5+4+2+2 school structure.,"The West Bengal Education department has issued the new State Education Policy (SEP) which retains the existing pattern of school education.
The Education department has issued the notification on September 9 which mooted the continuation of the state’s 5+4+2+2 school structure.

“Whereas, the state government has been considering the need of revamping its existing education system starting from pre-primary to higher education level in the state of West Bengal to ensure higher standard of education to all students, with particular focus on marginalised, disadvantaged and under-represented groups,” the notice said.
“And whereas, the state government, for this purpose constituted an expert committee comprising of eminent educationists,” the notification said.
The West Bengal government had set up the committee in April 2022 having distinguished academics – Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Sugata Bose, Suranjan Das – to guide the state about its response to the National Education Policy, which had been approved by the Union Cabinet on July 29, 2020, replacing the 34-year old National Policy on Education.
The committee submitted its findings to the West Bengal Education department earlier this year.
“The said committee, after due deliberation and in consultation with stakeholders… submitted its recommendations… the state government finalised the draft State Education Policy, 2023 based on the recommendations of the expert committee… the state cabinet has approved the State Education Policy, 2023 in its meeting dated August 7…Therefore, in consideration of all the above, the State Education Policy, 2023 is hereby notified, as appended with this notification with immediate effect,” the notice read.

An education department official said the SEP has notified to continue with the 5+4+2+2 pattern for school education.
“The policy specified beginning with one year of pre-primary, four years of primary up to class 4, two years of secondary and two years of higher secondary,” he said.
“The sole change in the existing structure is the inclusion of the first two years of education at an Anganwadi centre, to be followed by one year of pre-primary. But the rest structure of primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary would remain,” he said.
In the higher education level, classes 11 and 12, semester-level exams have been specified “to ease the transition from school to university in a phased manner… having a combination of multiple choice questions and descriptive ones” in the two semesters.
ADVERTISEMENT
About the three-language formula, it said “it will be introduced for students of classes 5 to 8 depending upon the availability of infrastructure.” While mother tongue as the first language will be the medium of instruction (Bengali in Bengali medium schools, Nepali in Nepali medium, Hindi in Hindi medium schools) which will also be determined by the linguistic and ethnic profile of the area, the second language will be any language other than the first language based on the preferences of the student (including English for vernacular mediums). The third language can be “any other language opted by the student, other than the first and second languages.
At the primary level, the policy suggested Bengali as a subject may be introduced from class 1 for students of other mediums of instruction.
The state has already mooted 4+1 formula for higher education where UG honours courses have been structured for four years instead of three and PG courses for one year in place of two.
Expert Committee member Aveek Majumder said, “We are happy that all our recommendations have been accepted by the government. To structure the school education sector in a rationalist way and its smooth transition to higher studies level. We hope our recommendations will help our students to be on par with their counterparts nationally and globally.” He said the recommendation by the expert committee to form a panel for implementing the recommendations at the earliest will also be taken up by the government.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/west-bengal-education-dep-notifies-new-state-education-policy-retains-existing-pattern-of-school-structure-8934250/,education

"‘None of these measures by Kota authorities will help us’: JEE, NEET aspirants complaint",The city in Rajasthan is known as the hub of coaching centres preparing students for the undergraduate entrance tests.,"With 23 students having allegedly died by suicide in Kota this year, the city’s attempts to prevent such deaths have come under the spotlight again. From the deputy collector to Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, many have urged the aspirants there to not be afraid of failure. The Rajasthan government has taken several steps to help the students and police have a dedicated cell to reach out to the aspirants.
Kota is known as the hub of coaching centres preparing students for undergraduate entrance tests JEE and NEET. Students from across India flock to the city to enrol in some of the top coaching institutes in the country.
Read | JEE Main 2024: Time management, balance old and new topics; here’s a complete guide for preparation
As per media reports, a high-level empowered committee recently recommended that coaching institutes reduce study hours and create a friendly environment by adding fun activities (such as yoga) to their routines. Some institutes have asked hostels to install a spring device on ceiling fans and “anti-suicide nets” on roofs and in balconies.
But are these measures actually helpful? The students are not fully convinced.
How do coaching centres at Kota work?
At most of these popular classes, the day begins at around 7 am and ends in the afternoon (1 pm to 2.30 pm), with each class lasting nearly an hour. There are evening batches for the rest of the students. Some teachers also host “doubts classes” in breaks if students request for them. On the other hand, some coaching centres have fixed timings for such special classes.
While the corporate world is debating the benefits of adopting a five-day work week, the students in Kota are still attending classes 6 days a week with the seventh day being the “test day”, which some say is a trigger for stress.

Another issue is the class strength, which ranges from 40 to 50 students, while a few classes have up to 100 to 200 students each. Although experts have suggested that classes should not be segregated on the basis of performance, some coaching centres are yet to make a conclusive decision on this.

Tuition fees for these classes cost nearly Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.50 lakh per year. There are also special packages with higher fees. If a student plans to buy a package for two years, the fee is around Rs 2 lakh to 2.50 lakh. There are additional costs for the hostel, electricity and laundry. Coaching centres also offer scholarships for students and exemption in fees is given on the basis of performance in scholarship tests. Also, some coaching centres have a discount rate for Hindi-medium students with packages as low as Rs 75,000 per year for coaching and Rs 1,80,000 per year for coaching, hostel and food combined.
Home away from home?
Nearly two lakh students come to Kota every year, and most of them are living away from their families for the first time. They have to manage a lot of things by themselves, like taking care of themselves, their chores, food, health and more.
“When we leave our home and come to live here alone, there are a lot of adjustments that we need to make, be it accommodation, availability of food and missing out on special days. That is something that we are mentally prepared for, but if we don’t communicate with our family and friends, that can lead to problems of loneliness,” Suifyaan Ansaari, a NEET candidate from Lucknow, told indianexpress.com.

In such cases, having a strong support system in Kota becomes essential. Ansaari, who is a first-time repeater of NEET UG, lives with his sister’s daughter, who is in Class 10 and is also preparing for NEET UG. Having a family member around helps by giving you that familiar feeling, he said.

The students who do not have a family member in Kota rely on friends, who then become family, or good-natured landlords.
“My landlord was really kind and helpful and treated me like family. My landlord’s son was a teacher at Allen and would help with my doubts whenever I needed. From the smallest of things to cheering me up when I scored less marks, my landlord would always be there for me to talk,” remembered Divyansh Jaiswal, who studied at Kota in 2021-2023 for JEE preparation.

Not all students, however, are thus lucky. Tamanna Saraogi, who lived in Kota in 2018, remembers how the stress gave her a mental breakdown and she eventually changed her stream. “Though the teachers and mentors were really good, I was unable to perform and score well. Plus there was homesickness too. I took a drop year in 2017 after my Class 12 but still couldn’t clear the exam. It hit me hard and I had a mental breakdown and slipped into depression. It was then that my parents, teachers and doctors told me to change the field as there is a lot of mental pressure,” she said.
She is currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Management from ISBR Business School, Bengaluru.

Stopping tests, but for whom?
Keeping in mind the increasing stress among students, the authorities asked the coaching institutes to stop conducting routine tests for the next two months. But some students argue that these tests help them assess their preparation and give them a helpful reality check.
Naitik, an 18-year-old preparing for JEE Main 2025, said the tests help him and his classmates revise the portion of the JEE syllabus they have covered, and “gives us an accurate picture of how much we have understood, and what are the areas we need to work on”.
He added that these tests help them prepare for the JEE exam environment, with the tests usually conducted in a pattern similar to the one followed by the National Testing Agency.
NEET student Ansaari concurred with the view. He said that even though the government had halted the tests, he had “downloaded previous year exams from my institute’s resources and I have been practising with that in my own room. I put a timer on, switch off my phone and create the environment of an exam hall while attempting these tests”.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked why he was keen to score good marks in these tests, Ansaari said, “Without these exams, I won’t be able to assess my performance, and that will actually give me more stress.”
Another student, who has been in Kota for the past two years, believes that if coaching centres had to conduct internal tests, they could do it without having the word come out of the classrooms. “If a teacher decides to conduct a small mock test in class, who will get to know? They can start quizzes etc which are not tests in the literal form but can still have the same impact. The problem is not these tests, but the way students are embarrassed by teachers about how much they score,” said *Radha (name changed on request).
Some of the teachers have also agreed with the need to conduct tests, which they believe have more benefits than harm.
A mental health expert, Dr Rachna Mishra, agreed with the students’ requests and said that while “internal assessment can provide valuable feedback and help students in their progress, excessive pressure or competition is what leads to stress”. She added that coaching centres should periodically assess the impact of these assessments and be willing to adjust their assessment strategies accordingly.

Topper and dropper in same class—recipe for a disaster
The Kota authorities have urged coaching centres not to segregate students into batches on the basis of their academic performance. They believe that centres privileging “elite” batches is a demotivating factor for other students, who often get a feeling of defeat.
However, students who are a part of the “Kota factory” believe segregating batches has actually helped them not feel burdened to match the speed of the toppers or be embarrassed about their performance.

“The reason toppers and low-scoring students are not put in the same section is that it helps teachers decide the pace and method of teaching. A student who is scoring less cannot be taught at the same pace as a topper. Tutors take time to explain topics to students who are unable to understand topics quickly. If the sections are mixed, it will turn out to be a waste of time for the toppers and an embarrassment for the low-scoring students. This will only increase the tension between the students. Right now, we all get along very nicely,” Ansaari explained.
Agreeing with this, Jaiswal, who was in Kota in 2021-2023, said the students who are at the top of their game need better competition, and thus not segregating sections by their academic performance will hamper the performance of those who are doing well.
ADVERTISEMENT
How to untangle the web?
One of the biggest changes that students are demanding is proper breaks in the 7-day study week. “Till before the new rule of pausing tests for a while, we used to have classes from Monday to Saturday and then a test on Sunday. This causes a lot of stress as we are constantly preparing for the Sunday verdict. We don’t get time to pursue our hobbies, relax, de-stress, interact with friends or family or study other subjects,” a 20-year-old NEET aspirant, Somdutt, said.
Shubhi Srivastava, a JEE aspirant in Kota, also believes that coaching centres should give students a one-day break before the tests, not after them. Coaching centres in Kota conduct tests every three weeks or in a month and give students a break after the tests. “Giving a break before the exam would reduce some of the stress and give us time to revise and prepare. Students get disheartened if they don’t perform well in these tests,” said Shubhi.
Teachers also think the way classes are scheduled can get “very hectic and stressful” for students. “I have cleared JEE too, and back in my time it used to be three days of classes and three days of rest, with one day for tests. That gave us a lot of time to relax and self-study. It was possible back then, so it is possible now too,” said a JEE teacher on condition of anonymity.

Another important aspect flagged by students and teachers is the importance of career counselling and communication. “Students need to be reminded that not clearing these competitive exams is not the end of the world. Be it your dream or your parents’, this is not the end. A lot of students in Kota forget that and think they will be termed as a ‘loser’ by the society if they don’t clear the exam,” Somdutt said.

Another student, Naitik, said that students tend to cut off communication with their families due to lack of time. Sometimes they stop talking to their friends also, as they are considered competitors.
“Communication is the key, even if you are in direct competition with them. It is important to not isolate yourself because once the loneliness starts getting to you, the downfall begins. And there is no bigger solution than human interaction, love and care,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/none-of-this-helps-jee-neet-aspirants-complaint-even-as-govt-tries-to-help-kota-students-8930324/,education

On September 1, 21-year-old Anil Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Banda district, was found dead in his hostel room at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. Back home, sitting on a plastic chair in the uneven, kuccha courtyard of her two-room house, Devi points to the guava tree to which a few goats are tied.
It was on August 31, two days after the family last had a conversation with Anil, that Amit Kumar, 31, the eldest of Devi’s four children, got the call from IIT-Delhi.
“It was not a conversation I had imagined even in my worst nightmare. I did not know whether to believe the caller or not. I was sure that my brother would not do something like that,” says Amit, an Arts graduate who drives a tempo in Banda and is the family’s sole earning member. Since his father Suresh Kumar, a bus conductor, passed away in September 2020, the family had been struggling financially.

‘Why humanities courses are integral – not supplementary – for engineering students’
Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) courses have been mandatory and integral components of the BTech programmes across IITs ever since the inception of the IIT system in the 1950s. HSS subjects comprise at least 10 per cent or more of the total credits that a BTech student completes in order to earn the degree. These courses, dependant on the faculty strength and focus areas in each of the 23 IITs, are wide-ranging: Communication skills, Economics, History, Language and Literature, Management, Philosophy, Psychology, Public Policy, Sociology, among others.
HSS courses in the IITs equip tomorrow’s engineers and scientists with a portable tool-kit that enables them to understand their place – as professionals, as citizens and as human beings – in a rapidly evolving world.

"Banda village to IIT Delhi, and an abrupt end to the dream journey of a 21 year old","Shy and brilliant at Maths, Anil Kumar, the son of a bus conductor from Banda, made a journey unusual for these parts: a selection to the Navodaya Vidyalaya for meritorious students, followed by a JEE coaching programme under scholarship, and finally a seat in IIT Delhi. But then, something snapped. On September 1, Anil was found dead in his hostel room. His story","Sitting in the ambulance that took her son’s shrouded body back to their home in Banda, Vidya Devi, 45, realised that her days spent sitting under the guava tree in her courtyard, waiting for her “Lalla” to come home, were now over.
On September 1, 21-year-old Anil Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Banda district, was found dead in his hostel room at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.
Back home, sitting on a plastic chair in the uneven, kuccha courtyard of her two-room house, Devi points to the guava tree to which a few goats are tied. “Anil would pluck guavas from this tree and play cricket by hitting the ball against that wall there… Virat Kohli, he would say, was his favourite… Lalla would pet the goats and feed them too, but could never manage to tie them to the trunk. My son couldn’t even tie a couple of goats and now they say he hung himself? How do I believe this?” she says, tears streaming down her sunken cheeks.
Having failed some classes in his second and third years, Anil, who joined the premier institute in 2019 to pursue a BTech in Mathematics and Computing, did not have enough credits to graduate with his batchmates, IIT officials had said. Anil, who belonged to the SC community, had been given an extension by the college.
THE CALL, JOURNEY TO DELHI
It was on August 31, two days after the family last had a conversation with Anil, that Amit Kumar, 31, the eldest of Devi’s four children, got the call from IIT-Delhi.
“It was not a conversation I had imagined even in my worst nightmare. I did not know whether to believe the caller or not. I was sure that my brother would not do something like that,” says Amit, an Arts graduate who drives a tempo in Banda and is the family’s sole earning member. Since his father Suresh Kumar, a bus conductor, passed away in September 2020, the family had been struggling financially.

Amit borrowed Rs 20,000 from a relative to hire an ambulance to take them nearly 700 km away to Delhi. “My wife, mother and I left immediately. When we reached the campus, we saw Anil’s room locked from outside. When I peeked through a window, I saw blood on the floor. I think he was murdered,” he says.

A senior Delhi Police officer had earlier said, “Though we have not yet recovered a suicide note, there is no indication of foul play…It has come to light that the student was not performing well, due to which he was suffering from mental trauma…Further probe is on.”

Devi, however, says she did not sense anything amiss during her last conversation with Anil on August 29. “As always, I asked him, ‘Lalla, did you eat on time? And how long before you get your degree?’ He told me that it was his last year in college. I was happy to learn that he would start earning soon. We tried calling him the next day, but he never answered.”
On whether the family was aware that Anil was on extension at IIT-Delhi, Amit says, “He told us that he had to spend an extra year on campus because he was home for a year during the lockdown. Anil had come home for his birthday this July. We couldn’t celebrate it since we have been struggling financially. We didn’t know then that it would be his last birthday with us. He left for Delhi after that and didn’t come home for Rakshabandhan.”
Pulling out a dusty brown trunk, Devi opens it to reveal Anil’s books, drawings, summer projects and some poetry that he had written. “Lalla had beautiful handwriting,” she says, caressing the notebook.

Wedged between equations and sketches, Anil wrote in one of his notebooks before he joined IIT-Delhi: “Since my childhood, my aim was to become a scientist. I didn’t know then that scientists are not made, they are born…”
Anil’s death was reported nearly two months after another IIT-Delhi student, Ayush Ashna, died by suicide in his hostel room. Like Anil, Ayush, who belonged to Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, was from the SC community.
MATHS, CRICKET AND IIT COACHING
Shy and lean, dressed usually in tees, and “loved keeping his hair long” — this was how Anil’s family and friends described him as a child.
Anil did his primary schooling in Anousa, his village in Baberu tehsil that’s about 31 km from Banda. “From the time he started writing, we knew he was brilliant… He was always great in Maths… It was his favourite subject,” says Amit, adding that the family moved out of their village to Banda’s Rajeev Nagar about 15 years ago, when his father was posted there.

Anil, by then, would go on to clear the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) selection test, an entrance exam that picks meritorious students from rural areas, and join the JNV at Durendi in his Class 6.

Durendi, about 10 km from Rajeev Nagar and on the banks of the river Ken, and the JNV hostel would be his home for the next five years.
His family says that throughout his stay in the JNV hostel, Anil would visit them regularly.

While in school, it was his passion for cricket that helped him make friends. “Although he was shy and never really played cricket, he would always keep track of the score in his notebook when the school teams played. That scorekeeping made him famous, but it still took him time to open up. And once he did, we realised he was, in fact, quite funny,” says one of Anil’s closest friends from the Durendi JNV, who would later make a similar journey to IIT Delhi.

“While in school, Anil and I were the only two who were selected by the Dakshana Foundation (an NGO that selects Class 10 students from JNVs for a two-year JEE and NEET coaching programme). From Durendi, we went to Rangareddy near Hyderabad (for JEE coaching) and then to Bundi (in Rajasthan),” the friend adds.

K P Agarwal, 56, Anil’s Math teacher in Class 10, says, “He was a very quiet child and very bright in Math. He scored A1 (between 90-100) in Maths in his Class 10 Board exams.”
Agarwal, who was in 2016 posted to the Mahoba JNV, adds, “Although Anil was a very good student, I don’t remember him participating in the extracurricular activities (debates, speeches, quizzes, etc) that we held on the campus on Saturdays. It saddens me to know that such a bright student is no more.”
Anil’s friend at JNV says, “I remember the day we got into IIT. He called me to discuss what branch we should opt for. It was such a proud day for his family.”

The friend and Anil, both from Banda, left for Hyderabad in 2017. Hyderabad was Anil’s first trip outside his home state. “Though Anil remained shy, he opened up somewhat in Hyderabad. None of our childhood friends would believe it, but once both of us bunked classes and scaled the boundary wall of our coaching centre in Gachibowli (near Hyderabad) to eat kathi rolls and chowmein at his favourite cafe,” he says.
The following year, the entire coaching batch was shifted to Bundi, where Anil finished his Class 12. Around the same time, his father broke his spinal cord in an accident on his way to work. One of Anil’s Class 12 batchmates recalls, “We had not gone home for two years by then and were always stressed. In the end, 15 students from Dakshana made it to IIT-Delhi, including Anil and me. While he was excellent in Maths, he was comparatively weaker in Physics and Chemistry.”

ONLINE CLASSES, A LOCKDOWN AND A DEATH
The first year at IIT, says Govind and Peeyush, Anil’s batchmates from Bundi who made it to IIT Delhi, was “fun” — watching shows, surfing the Internet and attending campus events. Anil was very active on social media then and would routinely post memes on his Instagram account. “He had a good sense of humour,” says Peeyush, adding “He was known at the Bundi centre for his aptitude in Maths. He would score more than the centre’s toppers in the subject.”

Govind adds, “We were together in Bundi and then in the same hostel at IIT-Delhi. So we became quite close.”
Sketching was another of Anil’s passions, they recall, adding that he would sketch characters from anime, TV series and fiction, and share them on social media. Like many others in first year, Anil spent a lot of time on his phone but “he wasn’t one to talk to people much”. “He would talk to you if you spoke to him. He never initiated a conversation on his own,” says Govind.
Peeyush says Anil’s cumulative grade point average (CGPA) at the end of his first year was 6.50, higher than the others in their group.
In 2020, as the country went into the Covid-19 lockdown and his college shifted to online classes, Anil, by then in his third semester, went back to Banda. His father succumbed to a heart attack in September 2020, just months after Anil’s birthday.

Swiping through her phone’s gallery, Anil’s mother stops at photographs taken on Anil’s birthday in July 2020, his last with his father. Anil, his face covered in cake, wears a huge grin as he poses with his parents. “We went big on his birthday that year. Since Anil hated green vegetables, I made poori and paneer,” she recalls.
The pandemic, says Peeyush, first interrupted their channel of communication. “He wouldn’t pick our calls,” he says.
One of Anil’s IIT batchmates says, “He distanced himself from us after his father’s death. I was in Banda during the lockdown. I visited his house a few times and tried to initiate conversations with him on cricket, something he loved, but he hardly spoke. All he said was that he felt low since his father’s demise and that he did not want to talk about his academic performance at all.”
Another of his IIT batchmates says, “In the first year, Anil’s performance was above average. His problems started after the lockdown. After he went back home — he lost his father and his family started suffering financially.”
The batchmate adds, “Students like us, who have studied in government schools all our lives, find it difficult to cope with the demands of IIT’s curriculum. Most of us don’t have the luxury of space or resources like Wi-Fi to study at home. Even if we get a room to study at home, it’s extremely difficult to focus. For an IITian, it is imperative to study for at least 5-6 hours daily after lectures. The pandemic made that almost impossible.”
It’s evident from Anil’s academic records, accessed by The Indian Express, that his performance started dipping in his second year, around the time of the pandemic and his father’s death.
On whether IIT-Delhi had a mechanism to keep track of students’ progress, especially Anil’s, during the lockdown, an official told The Indian Express, “During the pandemic, many relaxations were given to students as a one-time exception. We learnt about his father’s death when he came back after the lockdown. That was when our caretaker spoke to him about his performance. He was given an extension to complete his degree.”
Another batchmate from IIT-Delhi says, “When we came back to college after Covid, we assumed that he would not return because of his backlog.”
But Anil did return to campus in 2021. But by then, he seemed “deflated”. He also arrived much later than his friends, all of whom had no clue about his whereabouts till he called one of them from the railway station in New Delhi.
A friend who was with Anil in both Bundi and IIT-Delhi says the call from the railway station was probably the first sign of distress. “He told me that he had spent the past 2-3 days at the railway station, contemplating whether or not to return. I told him not to worry and asked our friends at Vindhyachal (hostel) to help him settle there. I knew he had failed his classes and that his family wasn’t doing well financially, but he didn’t want to talk about it.”
Having fallen far behind his 2019 batchmates, Anil had to take classes with his juniors and saw fewer and fewer of his batchmates on campus. “He got cut-off from us academically due to his backlog. Our classes ended up being completely different. I don’t know if he ever made friends with his juniors.”
Both Peeyush and Govind say Anil seemed and sounded low since his return. His social media activity too dropped drastically.
Peeyush says, “Anil and I went for a haircut. I tried to broach the subject of his father’s death, but he seemed hesitant to share anything.”
The friend who was with Anil in both Bundi and IIT-Delhi says, “He didn’t reach out to anyone for help. I was myself reeling under academic and financial pressures, so I didn’t think his problems would be any different. I used to give him a pep talk whenever possible.”
The dining hall in IIT-Delhi’s Vindhyachal hostel mess. Anil was often spotted there dining alone following his return post-Covid. (Special arrangement)
But friends and acquaintances say Anil would usually be found seated at the same spot at the dining table in the hostel mess — on the edge and almost always alone. “The conversation with him was almost always one-sided,” says a former hostel resident.
However, several Dakshana students at IIT-Delhi say theirs is a close-knit community and it is unusual for them to feel lonely on campus. “Most people in IIT feel lonely because they don’t have a support group in place, but a student from JNV and Dakshana is always surrounded by known faces after the years spent together coaching for JEE. Even if one is not confident in the first year, we develop confidence by the fourth year. That’s why Anil’s suicide was unexpected. We would’ve helped him out but he never gave the slightest hint of his troubles,” says one of his friends from IIT-Delhi.
His friends said Anil seemed “absolutely fine” during the convocation ceremony for the 2019 batch last month. In fact, Anil had contacted a childhood friend a few days before his demise for recommendations on a new phone.
Stating that Anil’s “disinterest” in his classes was apparent, the MP friend says, “How and why did no one notice that Anil had not come to the mess for two whole days? Someone should have noticed.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/banda-village-iit-delhi-anil-kumar-suicide-8931910/,education

Korukonda Babji, vice-chancellor of the university, said the university has never in 30 years verified any letter that it has received in the name of the NMC.
He said this in wake of an enquiry started against three medical colleges in the state for enhancing the number of medical seats in their institutions based on a fake approval letter from NMC.
“In 30 years, we have never verified. Never happened. We get so many letters from NMC, we can’t check every letter and it is very difficult to reach them (NMC). They don’t answer,” Babji told PTI.
Rajamahendravaram-based GSL Medical College, Maharajah Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS), Vizianagaram and Shantiram Medical College, Nandyala, is said to have fraudulently increased the number of medical seats available to students.

On September 1, the NMC issued a public notice that its Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) found that six forged letters were produced by GSL Medical College to increase MD General Medicine and MS General Surgery seats from 14 to 40 each and MS Obstetrics and Gynecology seats from eight to 25 on June 6, 2023.
It also said the same college claimed to have received another (forged) letter on July 7, 2023 granting it permission to increase post graduate dermatology seats from four to 15, MD Anaesthesiology seats from eight to 15 and MD Radiation Oncology seats from two to five.

MARB clarified that its original letter issued on May 19, 2023 was only for the increase of MD General Medicine seats from 14 to 24, MS Obstetrics and Gynecology from eight to 15 and MS General Surgery from 14 to 24.
“Moreover, no applications were received from GSL Medical College for increase of seats in MD DVL (dermatology), MD Anaesthesiology and MD Radio Oncology for the academic year 2023-24 and hence, no communication was sent to the college in this regard,” said the public notice.
Similarly, NMC observed that two fake letters were issued to MIMS to raise MD Radio Diagnosis seats from 15 to 24 and MD Anaesthesiology from four to 18 but flagged that actually no application was received from this college in this regard for 2023-24.
With respect to Shantiram Medical College, NMC said the college had produced eight fake letters that it puportedly received, to raise several seats in various branches, but no permission was actually given.

Babji said as things were proceeding well, the varsity had believed that all those letters were coming genuinely from NMC but was later cautioned that they were fake.
Further, he said, nobody knows who is the whistleblower in the case yet.
Meanwhile, GSL Medical College principal VS Gurunadh claimed it did not make up the letters and that the fake letters were issued to the college.
“It is not that the college has come up with a fake and forged letter, the college has been issued a fake and forged letter,” said Gurunadh, but failed to elaborate as to whose work it was.

3 private medical colleges in Andhra Pradesh probed for fraudulently increasing seats: Medical varsity VC,"Following the enquiry, the vice-chancellor said, the varsity will submit its findings to the government and also post updates on its website.","Dr YSR University of Health Sciences, the supervising authority for medical education in Andhra Pradesh, has opened an enquiry against three private medical colleges for allegedly producing fake permission letters from the National Medical Council to raise the number of seats, an official said on Thursday.
Vice-chancellor of the university Korukonda Babji said that three colleges, GSL Medical College, Rajamahendravaram; Maharajah Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS), Vizianagaram; and Shantiram Medical College, Nandyala, had indulged in this fraudulent practice.
“We called the principals of the three colleges and asked them to give their explanations. And we started the enquiry,” Babji told PTI.
Read | NEET PG likely in March 2024
According to Babji, the university initially accepted the Letters of Permission (LoP), mistaking them to be genuinely issued by the Council and allotted the enhanced seats, but had to annul them on receiving directions from the medical council that they were fake.
Due to this, the university has to redo the process of counselling (allotting seats to students in colleges, based on their preference and rank).
He highlighted the case of GSL Medical College which claimed to have obtained permission to the number of raise MD radio diagnosis seats from 10 to 24.
“We have received an LoP for 24 (seats). We have accepted and now the NMC says that it is fake. ‘Instead of 10, you are taking 24; we have not enhanced.’ We received a letter from NMC (saying) that the letter is fake,” he said, and added that he did not have the specifics on the number of seats fraudulently increased by the other two colleges.

Following the enquiry, the vice-chancellor said, the varsity would submit its findings to the government and also post updates on its website. He promised that nothing will be hidden.
Though the varsity is yet to take any action on the three colleges, Babji said that the Commission has booked an FIR. He said the university is more worried about completing the admissions process on time.

“We are worried and hurrying to do the counselling first because we have to follow NMC timelines. So, we don’t have much time for legal actions and all. We are worried about the students’ problem. We have to restart the counselling,” he said.
However, he assured that whatever action needs to be taken will be taken after completing the admissions. The unexpected development has disrupted the usual flow of activities in the varsity and also alerted aspiring students to be wary of these colleges.

‘Why humanities courses are integral – not supplementary – for engineering students’ | writes IIT Mandi professor,"""Whereas engineers are taught to think in terms of solutions, HSS courses enable them to ‘problematise’ the world around them. This involves appreciating the complexity of the world around us, and within us,"" writes Sethi.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Devika Sethi 
Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) courses have been mandatory and integral components of the BTech programmes across IITs ever since the inception of the IIT system in the 1950s. HSS subjects comprise at least 10% or more of the total credits that a BTech student completes in order to earn the degree. These courses, dependant on the faculty strength and focus areas in each of the 23 IITs, are wide-ranging: Communication skills, Economics, History, Language and Literature, Management, Philosophy, Psychology, Public Policy, Sociology, among others.
These courses are graded in very much the same way as STEM courses, and their titles appear on students’ transcripts. Faculty who teach these courses to BTech students also teach MA students and research scholars pursuing PhDs in these disciplines in the IITs. This makes for vibrant classrooms with participation of students pursuing different degrees in terms of levels and disciplines.
The champion of the IIT system, Jawaharlal Nehru, envisaged HSS subjects as integral – and not ancillary – to the education of engineers in modern India. I will focus here more on the increasingly relevant rationale for mandating engineering and science students to engage with HSS disciplines. Three terms that I feel encapsulate the rationale of complementing STEM education with HSS grounding are described below.
Inquiry
The process of knowledge transmission in HSS disciplines is intimately connected to the process of knowledge generation. These courses do not transfer data or information parcels to students in the classroom in a mechanical way. In any case, ‘information’ is more than easily available online. Instead, the teacher acts as a facilitator who trains students to investigate competing truth claims. Facts and models are held to be important but so are interpretations and outcomes.
Read | IIT-Madras Director, V Kamakoti on his journey from scoring poorly in his entrance test to becoming JEE chairperson
These courses train students to question, rather than to blindly accept, statements even when they sound authoritative. This is not to say that students are told that all claims are equally valid, but that they are sensitised to techniques through which they can evaluate the merit of claims, whether in a newspaper, a TV channel or by a figure of authority. It helps that HSS disciplines operate on a terrain characterised less by laws and more by human agency, contingency and the interplay of diverse social forces.
For instance, a history of science course may be less invested in explaining the mechanics of human evolution and more in familiarising students about the debates that happened (and continue to happen today) over Darwinian theories. Why do people disagree over something so fundamental? What are their assumptions and what are the implications of the denial of evolution? Once students learn how to ask the right questions and resist the temptation of easy answers, this skill is applied by them in facets of their daily life.
ADVERTISEMENT
Inter-connectedness
Engineering and Science operate in a multi-layered context. The engineer or scientist is a creation of various historical and sociological forces and identities, which have resulted from a fascinating inter-play of national/class/caste/gender/race and other forms of identification. Similarly, the recipients of technology are themselves not an undifferentiated mass. Technology’s impact too is not binary (good/bad), as we know from our everyday experience of using the internet, or the mobile phone.
Understanding the forces that have shaped oneself, the recipients of technology and the context of technology transfer or application becomes essential.
The recent super-hit film Oppenheimer was much more than a biopic of the architect of the atomic bomb. It demonstrated with startling clarity the perils of divorcing ethics and empathy – the foundations of philosophy and literature – from the processes of technological development.
We have seen debates over the ethics of cloning and search algorithms. Technology has both intended and unintended effects, engineers and scientists trained in HSS disciplines are better oriented towards both perceiving this truth and ideally also grounding technological innovations in a bedrock of non-negotiable ethics.
Read | Behind IITians opting for non-core jobs are structural issues of JEE Advanced, rigid curriculum
HSS courses typically do not fetishise the origins of knowledge in terms of flat, undifferentiated categories (‘Indian’/ ‘Western’) but instead focus on the context in which knowledge has been/is produced, as well as the process by which opinions or anecdotes become verified knowledge, evaluated by professional and not ideological standards.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ideation
Creative thinking and problem-solving are allied in their methods. Whereas engineers are taught to think in terms of solutions, for which they ideally should apply creative thinking, HSS courses enable them to ‘problematise’ the world around them. This involves thinking of social and other phenomena not in terms of black/white or good/evil, but understanding and appreciating the complexity of the world around us, and within us. If creativity is defined as making new and numerous connections across seemingly unconnected mental or physical objects, then HSS courses certainly facilitate creative thinking that is not confined to any one discipline. Communication skills, which are essential to communicate one’s ideas and one’s self to the world, further help BTech students in real-world situations.

HSS courses in the IITs equip tomorrow’s engineers and scientists with a portable tool-kit that enables them to understand their place – as professionals, as citizens and as human beings – in a rapidly evolving world. This kind of knowledge and these skills are not necessarily to be valued for instrumental (or applied) uses alone, though they may well help in navigating the real-world. Students learn that there is both pleasure and profit to be had from trying to understand how people lived and thought in the past, what forces shape individuals and societies today, how the human mind thinks and functions, what drives people, organisations and social phenomena, and how embedded technology is in real-world contexts.

"‘Star or repeater, stop segregating batches’: Experts warn coaching institutes in Kota",The year 2023 saw the highest number of student suicides -- 22 so far -- with two ending their lives in a gap of a few hours on August 27.,"Star, Leader, Dropper, Achiever, Repeater or Enthusiast — experts have warned coaching centres in Rajasthan’s Kota not to segregate batches on these criteria as increasing students’ suicides have become a cause for worry.
The so-called “Kota Factory” has become an epicentre of debate about various factors causing stress among students, prompting them to take the extreme step.
According to the district administration and psychological experts, the practice of dividing students into these batches and giving an obvious push to the “elite” batches, is a demotivating factor for other students and often gives them a feeling of defeat.
District Collector OP Bunkar said that the coaching institutes are being advised against this “batch segregation”.
“The students are not apples and oranges that we can segregate them accordingly. Every student has different requirements and segregating them in batches is like stereotyping and leaves less scope of benefiting from each other,” he said.

“Star batch” is considered as the best batch in all coaching institutes here which caters to the top performers. Best teachers, extra attention and focus, motivational classes, solving tricks sessions — are especially arranged for this batch and ultimately some of the students make it to the banners splashed across the country when results are out. For coaching institutes, star batch is their best bet and also the key for further business.
“Repeater” and “Dropper” batches are for students who have made previous attempts at the exam and have taken a gap year in their study plan. “Achiever” batch is for students who have potential of doing better but are currently not performing well and “Enthusiast” batch is for students who aspire to do well but have to improve a lot to achieve the feat.

Over 2.5 lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.
The year 2023 saw the highest number of student suicides — 22 so far — with two ending their lives in a gap of a few hours on August 27. Last year, the figure was 15. Packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness are some of the common struggles of the students here.
Apart from the major coaching centres, students also enrol at individual teachers to concentrate on sole subjects, like the one at P Joys Chemistry classes which is very popular in Kota, Rajasthan. (Representative image. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)
While coaching institutes argue that the division of batches helps them to offer different kind of teachers and adopt strategies according to requirements of the group, psychologists have a different view on this and say the categorisation of low scorers and top scorers makes it even worse for struggling students.
“The moment you shift one student to a different batch on basis of his or her deteriorating performance, you are already telling the student that it is a lost battle. The confidence of the student takes a hit and at times they do not recover. The whole battle becomes about moving to the ‘elite’ batches and not the main exam. Sometimes when parents get to know about the ‘downgrade’ they put pressure on the student and the cycle never ends,” said Neena Vijayvargia, pyschiatrist at Health Mind Clinic.

Vijayvargia, who is herself a product of a top coaching institute in Kota, said, “Sometimes in the star batch also the students start feeling demotivated, because so far he or she has been a top performer and the moment he enters that batch, the rank goes down. Similarly, if you repetitively tell a student he or she is a gap-year candidate, a fact that is already being reminded of at home, and they are bound to feel depressed.”
From asking hostels, flat owners and all paying guest accommodations to mandatorily install spring-loaded ceiling fans, anti-suicide nets in buildings and allowing a weekly off to better monitoring of student activities by hostel wardens, the district administration has been issuing orders, many of which have been deemed cosmetic and controversial.
Dinesh Sharma, head of psychology department at Government Nursing College, Kota said the ranking system is already a demotivating push for the students and the race for the ‘star’ batch makes it a stressful journey.
“We agree the exams like JEE and NEET are extremely competitive but the idea is to prepare students holistically. In an exam where every two marks deducted makes a students’ rank slip by several hundred positions, giving this kind of mental conditioning to students is not a good idea. A very sharp student and a little less sharp student can study together as they can get motivation from each other,” he said.

“You are not alone in the city. I am here (main hoon na), doors of my office and home are always open for every student. Don’t hesitate. Learn to share the stress.

Over 2.5 lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.
The year 2023 has seen the highest number of student suicides — 22 so far — with two ending their lives in a gap of a few hours on August 27. Last year, the figure was 15.
A packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness are the common struggles of the students here.
In his letter, the Kota collector expressed concern over the suicide incidents and urged students not to get disheartened over failures.

Referring to the students who recently allegedly died by suicide here, Bunkar wrote, “You have gone, but before going, you should have thought what would happen to your parents who were committed to fulfilling your dreams by willingly sacrificing whatever they had.”
“You all became members of my family on the very first day you reached this city to fulfil your dreams and I am constantly in an effort to care for you and to provide you a happy environment here,” the collector wrote to the students Bunkar, in his letter, also recollected the joyous time he spent during interaction with some students.
“All of you work very hard to attain your target,” the collector said, adding, “If one road is closed, several other roads are open and waiting for you.” “With a little fall in ranking in a test, you take yourself broken down, sink into tension and pack yourself in a room and continue to think that nothing could happen now,” Bunkar pointed out to the students, while adding that “failure is the first step to success” and none of their failures was a parameter to decide their personality.

The collector exhorted the students to explore the city and visit the nature parks and recreation centres for relaxation.

“Just once come out and see what is not there in my city, the beautiful riverfront, rising waves of River Chambal, fascinating gardens and groves; every circle is eager to welcome you,” the collector urged the students.
He also advised students to take some time out to meet friends and for other fun activities so that they feel refreshed.
Bunkar also mentioned in the letter the initiatives taken for the students to release them from stress and to address their concerns. He also called upon students to explore their potential as there were several avenues to a bright future.
Concluding his letter to students with an inspirational note, the Kota DC said, “Dear students, you are strong, have got a lot to live life. You have the courage to move on ahead surmounting every weakness and difficulty. Believe it, nobody can defeat you until you yourself succumb to defeat.” After a rise in student suicides here in 2016, the then collector of Kota Ravi Kumar Surpur wrote an emotional letter to parents of coaching students asking them not to burden their wards with their expectations and dreams.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/you-are-not-alone-here-main-hoon-na-kota-dc-tells-jee-neet-aspirants-suicide-cases-8924170/,education

While the wardens are being encouraged to participate actively in the ‘Darwaze pe dastak’ (knock on door) campaign, the city police has urged the mess workers and tiffin providers to report if a student is repetitively absent from the mess and skipping meals or anyone’s tiffin is found unconsumed.
“We have launched a campaign called ‘Darwaze pe dastak’ where we are encouraging wardens to make it a routine to knock on each students’ door at around 11 pm, ask them if they are okay, notice their activities, and keep a vigil just to ensure that there are no signs of stress, depression or abnormal activity.
“After coaching, the students spend maximum time in hostels, and hence wardens should be the first one to notice the signs,” Chandrasheel Thakur, ASP, Kota.

Psychologists have been warning that there are always signs that go undetected before any child takes the extreme step.
“The idea is to detect these early signs. If any student is repetitively missing classes or skipping meals, there has to be something.

We have launched a dedicated number on which wardens, mess workers and tiffin providers can give us this information,” he added.

I check their mess logbooks too. If someone has not eaten meals in the mess, I ask if he or she did not like the food or is it because of some stress,” she said.

"Delhi HC seeks replies from Centre, UGC on DU admission in law courses solely via CLAT",The court passed the order on August 25 after the Centre's counsel said CUET was not mandatory for central universities as they enjoy autonomy in matters of admission while the UGC's lawyer took a contrary stand.,"The Delhi High Court has sought detailed replies from the Centre and the University Grants Commission (UGC) over a plea against the Delhi University’s decision to admit students to five-year integrated law courses solely based on the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT-UG), 2023, and not the Common University Entrance Test (CUET).
The court passed the order on August 25 after the Centre’s counsel said CUET was not mandatory for central universities as they enjoy autonomy in matters of admission while the UGC’s lawyer took a contrary stand.
“(Centre’s lawyer) has categorically stated that, the Common University Entrance Test is not mandatory for central universities and that they enjoy autonomy in the matter of admission… University Grants Commission (lawyer) categorically states that it is mandatory for all central universities to adhere to the CUET for admission to UG/ PG programmes,” noted a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Narula.
“UGC as well as Union of India are granted one week’s time to file a detailed counter-affidavit,” the bench said.
Petitioner Prince Singh, a law student at Campus Law Centre in Delhi University, argued in his petition that the university while issuing the impugned notification, imposed a “wholly unreasonable and arbitrary condition” that the admission to five-year integrated law courses shall be solely based upon merit in the CLAT-UG result, which is violative of the Right to Equality under Article 14 and Right to Education under Article 21.
The plea stated that the condition lacks any intelligible differentia and has no rational nexus with the object of admission to the five-year integrated law courses at the Faculty of Law. It sought that admission to the five-year integrated law courses be done through the CUET-UG, 2023.
In his petition, Singh said that CUET-UG 2023 was for admission to all undergraduate programmes in central universities for the academic session 2023-24.
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier this month, the high court questioned Delhi University’s decision to admit students to five-year integrated law courses solely based on CLAT-UG, 2023.
The court had said that when other central universities were taking admissions for the course based on CUET UG 2023 introduced by the Ministry of Education, Delhi University was “not special”.
The matter would be heard next on September 12.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/delhi-hc-seeks-replies-from-centre-ugc-on-du-admission-in-law-courses-through-clat-8916052/,education

‘I want him to crack JEE but don’t want to lose him in the process’: Worried parents shift to Kota to support ward’s education,"Packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents' expectations and homesickness, are among the common struggles of the students here.","From mothers on sabbatical to grandparents and homemakers, many people are choosing to shift to the coaching hub Kota with their children to ensure they are not stressed while preparing for entrance exams and do not take any extreme step.
Neeru Devi from Bihar’s Sitamarhi has shifted to Kota, the country’s coaching hub, at the age of 80 to be with her grandson who is preparing for the IIT entrance exam at an institute here.
“We would not have been at peace back home,” she said, shedding light on the mounting pressure faced by students preparing for medical and engineering entrance exams here.

The year 2023 saw the highest number of student suicides — 22 so far — with two ending their lives in a gap of a few hours on August 27. Last year, the figure was 15.
Packed schedule, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, the burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness, are among the common struggles of the students here.
Many parents are now averse to putting their children in hostels. Instead, they are renting accommodation in Kota and staying with their children by even taking sabbaticals.
Sandhya Dwivedi from Madhya Pradesh’s Satna is staying with her son here while her husband manages other responsibilities back home.

“Now I worry less. My son studies at night… I give him tea or coffee. He knows I am here to talk to him and comfort him. He was ill twice this month and I was here to take care of him. I want him to crack JEE but I don’t want to lose him in the process… we have been hearing about student suicides and we cannot take that risk,” she said.
Over two-and-half lakh students move to Kota annually to prepare for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges.
Neeru Devi said, “We have been hearing all kinds of news. So we decided to not keep him in a hostel but to stay with him… Now I am staying with him and if he doesn’t perform well or doesn’t feel comfortable, his mother will come here.”

“At times children hesitate to call home and talk about their stress. But since I am here, I will be able to notice any changes in her behaviour and comfort her. My husband is in Chandigarh with our son who is in class five,” she said.
Kumari Shimpi from Bihar’s Jahanabad is living in Kota with her two children. “My son is preparing for JEE and my daughter for NEET. With me here, at least they won’t feel homesick. Bogged down by studies, if they do not get good food or have to do their own laundry, they won’t be comfortable and I will be worried if they take some extreme step in pressure.
“I tell them that if you don’t crack the exam, we will go back but I will be here as long as you are here,” she said. Battling to keep a check on student suicides, Kota Police say it is very important that parents acclimatise their children to the struggles of the city so they do not feel lost here.

In a bid to spread awareness, the initiative included a theatrical performance and role-play showcasing myths and facts related to organ donation. These events were held in nearby villages, gardens, and malls. Furthermore, poster and slogan competitions centered around the same theme were organized, including a poster competition in schools to enlighten the upcoming generation about this noble cause. Going the extra mile, the University extended gratitude to the families of organ donors, acknowledging the life-saving commitment made by their loved ones. Over the years, these awareness initiatives have yielded a rising number of individuals pledging organ donation and committing to the cause. Embracing advancing technologies, the institution introduced a mobile application to ensure more frequent organ donation awareness. This app not only disseminates information and insights but also provides an avenue for taking the pledge.
“Organ and tissue donation holds more significance than many realize, impacting society and directly transforming lives. Numerous individuals await organ transplants to attain healthier, more productive lives. Organ donation empowers recipients to lead extended, higher-quality lives. Transplants have the potential to either save lives or significantly enhance their quality. Raising awareness about organ donation is the remedy to this distressing situation. A greater number of potential donors translates to increased availability of organs, poised to save lives. Unfortunately, few in India possess adequate knowledge about organ donation or how they can contribute posthumously. At its core, organ and tissue donation is about aiding people and extending a helping hand. It is our moral duty. Let us pledge that no life in India shall be lost due to a dearth of organs,” remarked Dr. Komal Patel, Vice President of Parul University and Medical Director at Parul Sevashram Hospital. She also unveiled plans for a special marathon, “Run for Organ Donation,” scheduled for December 2023. Dr. Patel highlighted the state-of-the-art Kidney Transplant Unit at Parul Sevashram Hospital, which has successfully conducted five live-donor-related transplants under the guidance of an adept team of medical professionals and hospital staff.

"‘Constantly preparing for board exams’: Students, teachers react to NCF","Twice the stress or a relief? Teachers, students react on govt's decision to conduct board exams twice in a year","The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), released by the Centre this week, has brought a change in the way board exams will be conducted from the next academic year. The new guidelines mandate teaching of three languages, including two Indian languages, in classes 9-10, and two languages, including one Indian language, in class 11-12.
Additionally, board exams of class 12 will be offered at least twice a year. Students can then appear for a board exam in subjects they have completed and feel ready for, and they will also be allowed to retain the best score. The government claims that this is to ensure students have enough time and opportunity to perform well.

Parul University’s excellent program outcome for B.Pharm: The importance of solid academics and strategic industrial ties,"Further progress in the sector beckons universities to set up their game towards research-oriented B.Pharm programs, a feat that Parul University has been successful at since its inception.","The advent of modern pharmaceutical science has been the bedrock of the quality of life we enjoy today. Already India for long has been known as a global leader in the supply of pharmaceuticals, a legacy which was further bolstered during the pandemic by the domestic production of COVID vaccines. However, anyone from the medical fraternity will attest that there is still much advancement to be made in pharmaceutical research to cope with the health challenges we continue to face. This is where the role of the education sector comes in.  Further progress in the sector beckons universities to set up their game towards research-oriented B.Pharm programs, a feat that Parul University has been successful at since its inception.
Considering that the pharmaceutical industry demands professionals who are adept at both practical research and academic knowledge of the domain, the Vadodara-based university ensures that learning research skills is an inseparable part of its B.Pharm program, which also has a lateral entry option. Apart from top educators from IITs, NITs, and IISc, Parul University has 45+ world-class laboratories dedicated to pharmaceutical research, ensuring a research-focused program outcome. The facilities include the Chemistry and Pharmaceutics Lab, the Central Research Lab, the Quality Assurance Lab, the Skill & Simulation Lab, and access to work in a 750-bedded hospital. But most importantly, what makes the university program so unique as compared to its counterparts is the strategic alliances that Parul University has forged over the years. These partnerships not just include industry players but also experts, who can guide and nurture talent.
To elaborate, via various platforms, the institute offers the enviable opportunity to launch one’s research career under the guidance of eminent experts in the discipline, whose presence further accentuates the mettle of Parul University. The domain leaders include Dr. Gordhan Patel, President of JP Laboratories Inc, Padmashree Prof. Dr. Dipankar Chaterjee, who was the former President and Secretary, IASC, Fellow INSA, Padmashree Prof. Dr. Sujoy Guha, associated with the Centre for Biomedical Engg. IIT and AIIMS, New Delhi, and Dr Pravin Ingole, Scientist, CSIR – NEIST, Assam. Similarly, in terms of industry collaborations, the university has over 700+ tie-ups that provide a window for the students to be part of cutting-edge research undertakings, giving them a head start to a rewarding career in R&D.
Attesting to the success of the research-focused thrust of the program, Parul University has garnered an impressive amount of research funding, adding to around 15 crores.  Some of the top projects headed by the university were in association with the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK, ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), European Union-funded CABCIN project, and Gujarat Council of Science Technology, amounting to 179 lakhs, 298 lakhs, 63 lakhs and 82 lakhs, respectively. Further, the NAAC A++-ranked university has also been the driving force behind 320+ filed and granted patents, leading the institute to be ranked 7th across the country by the Indian Patent Office. Also, adding to its list of achievements in terms of research, Parul University is DSIR( Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India)-recognised and accredited by the prestigious NABL (National Accreditation Board for Test and Calibration of Laboratories).
About the program and tie-ups, Dr. Parul Patel, Vice President, Parul University said, “Education at Parul University has always been about what our cohorts can do to contribute to the industry and the society at large. This is why for a medical science-oriented program such as B.Pharm we spared no effort in blending practical and academic learning seamlessly so that both aspects of the discipline get their due attention, leading to an ideal program outcome. We reckon that while top educators can foster a solid theoretical foundation, industry-based training is imperative to strengthen the practical aspects of the subject. This is why we have painstakingly forged industry connections. Moreover, as students participate in industry projects they also develop the ability to collaborate, an essential quality for a good researcher.”
Additionally, Parul University’s education has always been about giving back to society. The research collaboration with the prestigious IAMA ( Indian American Medical Association) aimed at exploring medicine and pharmaceutical-centric welfare projects, would be one such example where a strategic partnership of the university has been about helping society. 
The conjoined project with IAMA is also a fine example of international exposure, which again is important for budding scientists, given the fact that the more they are in touch with a synergy of ideas, the more they are likely to flourish. On the global exposure front as well Parul University has left no stone unturned. The university currently enjoys over 75 Global Partnerships.

The column appears every Friday)
— MR Ravi, Sangeeta Kohli & Kushal Shah
IIT Madras Director V Kamakoti seems to have stirred a hornet’s nest by expressing concern over engineering students largely choosing non-engineering careers.
In a response to Professsor Kamakoti, IIT Bombay’s Prof. Milind Sohoni has suggested that the primary responsibility for this situation lies with IIT faculty members who have not been able to establish any connect with the society or industry, and the IIT administrators who have not been able to design a suitable admission process that values actual engineering interest.
While these points are partially valid, they do not address the root of a complex problem.
To address the concerns raised by Professor Kamakoti, we need to first acknowledge that students in India choose IITs primarily due to peer or parental or societal pressure.
Kota Factory | City of NEET, IIT JEE coaching fails to teach friendship; aspirants say 'there are only competitors'
IITs usually attract students who are interested in its brand value and the potential pay package it can lead to. So, is it that students who are genuinely interested in engineering are unable to crack the IIT-JEE? Is the IIT-JEE not designed to test actual engineering talent and interest?
Engineering is a complex field with many different branches. It requires at least a couple of years of serious study for any student to know whether s/he is interested in it. Clearly, this is not possible at the +2 level.
ADVERTISEMENT
Expecting students to rationally choose their branch of engineering just after Class 12 and stick to it for the rest of their lives is not practical. At the school level, we can surely organise a few engineering workshops, but that is far from being adequate to enable school students to make a rational career decision.
Additionally, IITs are one of the very few Indian institutions that have a global prestige value. In general, bright students would not want to miss out on this rare opportunity of being associated with the IIT tag.
Although this rat race has benefited India by putting Indian students on the forefront of the software revolution, it is now hurting Indian interests by preventing other important engineering domains from growing.
Of course, software jobs pay much better than core engineering jobs, but that scenario is slowly changing. This is mainly due to the government emphasis on manufacturing and developing global engineering products from India.

We already have some successful examples in Ola and boAt. Many more are likely to emerge in the future. This problem needs to be solved by bringing about much needed reforms in our engineering education system, as well as creating awareness among students and parents.
Regarding the engineering education system, the most important change required is to avoid forcing students to make a choice of engineering branch right after their school or Class 12.
As mentioned above, it is impractical to expect students to make a rational choice at this stage. Most students who are good at science in school tend to have a bipolar view. They are not well aware of opportunities outside of engineering and medical fields.
The ideal solution may be to have a short Bachelor’s degree exploring a variety of science related courses, after which students will be in a better position to decide their professional career path. This is similar to the education model that was followed earlier by IISc Bangalore and Madras Institute of Technology (Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam’s alma mater).
ADVERTISEMENT
For example, in the 1980s, students could get admission into the B.E. programme of IISc Bangalore only after completing B.Sc. However, this model has fallen out of favour over the years since it took longer for students to get prepared for jobs. It may be good to reconsider this format of education in view of the serious problems created by forcing students to choose a professional path just after completing their Class 12.
A stepping stone towards this approach could perhaps be to make our existing engineering curriculum less restricted by the various branches.
In the first two years of engineering education, students should ideally do some common courses, and then be allowed to take any combination of courses to get an exposure into the basic concepts of various branches that may be of interest to them.
After this initial exposure in the first two years, a student will be in a much better position to decide his/her branch. Some people may think that all students will end up taking only computer science courses, but this is unlikely to happen since a student needs only a few computer science courses to get a software job.
ADVERTISEMENT
With this model aimed at familiarising students with different branches of engineering, we will most likely see a good distribution of students in various courses. This can be facilitated through close engagement between faculty members and students at IITs. Even the courses with seemingly low popularity among students may see a renewed interest.
In terms of admissions, IITs could downplay the unhealthy obsession with competitive exams like JEE by also exploring non-JEE avenues for taking in students. For example, students who have excelled in one of the international olympiads could be given admission without having to clear JEE.
In line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommendations, IITs could also consider lateral entry into higher semesters for students who have done two to three years of undergraduate studies in other science disciplines. This will help in promoting a culture of pursuing excellence in one’s own field of interest. This is a very important cultural shift needed in India where for most people, life is all about chasing the goals set by the society, family or their peers.
While these systemic changes can make a huge difference, implementation is very hard. We should surely keep pushing for them, but it is also important to see if we can facilitate a change in other ways. And this change has to begin by sensitising students in schools and their parents all across India.
ADVERTISEMENT
There is also hardly any discussion at the school level on the contributions of various professions to the society that could enable students to start thinking rationally about their lives beyond the usual societal norms.
Open conversations can be a great change agent. IITs could take the lead in this regard and start organising regular discussions sessions between IIT faculty and students and parents at various schools.
The goal of these discussions should not reinforce the already bloated image of IITs. It should instead discuss the fundamentals of engineering.

"Kota Factory: City of NEET, IIT JEE coaching fails to teach friendship; aspirants say ‘there are only competitors’",Experts warn that parents also see friendships as potential distractions for their wards and discourage them to make friends when they are here for coaching.,"There are no friends but only competitors in the country’s coaching capital popularly known as “Kota factory”, say students and experts as the government struggles to keep a check on the spate of suicides among engineering and medical aspirants.
Authorities say 20 students preparing for competitive exams in Kota have ended their lives so far in 2023 — highest for any year. Last year, the figure was 15.
Also Read | In wake of suicide cases, authorities in Kota ask coaching institutes to stop conducting routine tests for NEET, JEE aspirants
Battling with packed schedules, cut-throat competition, constant pressure to do better, burden of parents’ expectations and homesickness, students say they often find themselves alone with no one to talk to and share their feelings with.
Experts warn that parents also see friendships as potential distractions for their wards and discourage them to make friends when they are here for coaching.
“There is no concept of friendship here…there are only competitors. Every student sitting next to you is seen as an additional burden to fight with. Unlike schools and colleges, nobody shares notes among peers here because everybody is seen as a threat who might take one’s seat away in the college of his or her choice,” said Ridhima Swamy, a NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) aspirant from Madhya Pradesh in kota.
Mansi Singh, a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) aspirant from Odisha, who has been here for the last two years said life in Kota feels like one is on a “treadmill”.
“It is like running on a treadmill. You only have two options either to get down or keep running. You cannot take a break, cannot slow down but only keep running,” she added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Another student, who did not wish to be identified, said every moment not spent on studying is considered “wasted” which triggers a cycle of guilt and ultimately impacts the performance causing further stress.
Sharing an incident, the student from Maharashtra in Kota said, “One day I received a call from the mother of one of the boys here who lives in the same hostel. She was worried that she was not able to reach her son and wanted me to check on him as he had not been attending classes for a week. I assured her that I will go to his room, once back to hostel. I went back and got busy studying. While his mom kept calling me, I was busy preparing for a test the next day that I was restless that I would lose time and will not be able to prepare well”.

“His mom figured out someone else and the issue was sorted but later I felt guilty that what if he was unwell, what if he had taken the extreme step and all I could think was that I will get less time to prepare for a test…such is the pressure here…I couldn’t sleep for days when the realisation hit me,” he said.
Dinesh Sharma, Head of Psychology Department, Government Nursing College, said students neither open up nor develop empathy for their peers here.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The first instructions from the parents when they drop their kids here is…do not waste time in friendships, you are here to study. When parents see it negatively, students feel that it is something wrong and should not be done.
“Every coaching has counsellors now but these students are apprehensive about opening up with them thinking their parents might be informed…so friends can be really helpful but here those who make friends are not seen in good light,” he said.
His thoughts were echoed by Kota Additional SP Chandrasheel Thakur, who said every student shows some symptoms when he/she is stressed and since parents are far away, his or her friends will be the first to know.
“There are no joint exercises in coaching, it is an individual journey and these students often end up feeling lonely. There have been times when some hostel mates have informed us about someone locking their door from inside and we have intervened timely. Majority of the students here are living away from the family for the first time… having friends can be very helpful, it should be encouraged,” he said.

For a student preparing for competitive exams in Kota, the academic schedule would typically include classes for seven or eight hours from Monday to Saturday with a brief interval for refreshment, sometimes doubt sessions and remedial classes on Sundays, at least three internal tests during a week and one major test on the last Sunday of a month.
Often bogged down with the fast paced curriculum and the programme structure, Kota students say they are always racing against time and even a day’s break can push them behind thousands of other students.
However, the recent cases of student suicides has rekindled the debate about whether enough measures are being taken to ensure healthy competition among students.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot last week directed officials to form a committee to provide suggestions on preventing suicides. The committee will comprise all stakeholders, including representatives from coaching institutes, parents and doctors, and it will submit its report in 15 days.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/kota-factory-city-of-iit-jee-neet-coaching-fails-to-teach-friendship-aspirants-say-there-are-only-competitors-8906820/,education

However, what sets PU’s Faculty of Management’s approach to business education apart from the host of B-schools that mushroom on the educational landscape every now and then, is the thrust on being abreast with industry trends.
Elaborating on the industry-specific pedagogy of the MBA programmes, Dr. Devanshu Patel, President, Parul University “We at Parul University understand that the business landscape is constantly changing and for that new subjects need to be explored. But a few basics always remain constant. Apart from emphasising the development of capabilities such as analytical and interpersonal skills, we leave no stone unturned to offer a good hands-on feel of the industry. After all, business education, especially MBA, is more than core academics.”
Committed to superlative pedagogic outcomes, the PU has brought together industry experts as well as leading academics to teach and mentor the candidates. With 150+ top educators from IITs, NITs, IISc, and other premier institutions, who boast an extensive research-centric background, Parul University strives to inculcate sought-after qualities such as critical thinking and research skills. Needless to say, these academic abilities, associated with success at the workplace, gear candidates towards rewarding careers.
Moreover, to ensure that students are ready to take up challenging roles right when they graduate, the university collaborates with industry experts to incorporate updated materials and course structures. As a result, the courses offered by the Faculty of Management endeavour to create a synergy between real-time problem-solving as well as academic foundation. At the same time, the 700+ strategic industry partnerships that PU has established over the years, offer a unique window for candidates to participate in various real-world projects, helping them gain expert-supervised practical experience.

Similarly, an impressive investment of over 10 crores received for the institute-led start-ups and 125 entrepreneurial projects validate the industry-specific learning at Parul University. In this regard as well, the one-on-one mentorship that the candidates receive from both industry leaders and academics contributes towards the phenomenal professional success of the candidates. The guidance from experts helps candidates master the current best industry practices.
Finally, one of the most enviable aspects of an MBA at PU is the international exposure that one gets. In this globalising world, international exposure has become the key to success. As a result, the university has forged over 75 international partnerships as well as a robust presence of international students, totalling a jaw-dropping 2000 candidates.

"Parul University’s investment in infrastructure, alliance and Talent: The research-centric framework for Master’s programs in STEM","Towards the advancement of society, STEM research plays a crucial role. In other words, the more the universities or other institutions for academic pursuits push research, especially cutting-edge probing related to science, the more they contribute towards the betterment of the world.","Towards the advancement of society, STEM research plays a crucial role. In other words, the more the universities or other institutions for academic pursuits push research, especially cutting-edge probing related to science, the more they contribute towards the betterment of the world. Upholding this noble purpose, Parul University, a Vadodara-based institute of higher education, which is well-known across India, has dedicated a major share of its efforts to gearing its Faculty of Applied Sciences on being research-oriented. As a result, the Faculty of Applied Science has been, since its inception, handholding its Master’s cohorts towards R&D and fundamental research, and more importantly, has created a massive framework, both in terms of physical infrastructure and human capital.
Elaborating the research-centric mindset of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Dr. Devanshu Patel, President, Parul University said, “Parul University’s Faculty of Applied Sciences understands that if as a society we aspire to acquiring improved ease of life, improving access to resources and well-being of people, and for the sheer joy of learning, better understand the world, research is the way forward. While at the bachelor’s level, we focus mainly on building the required foundation and skills that train the scientific mind- although the thrust on research is still there- the Master’s programs come with a special emphasis on furthering our ambit of scientific knowledge. Consequently, we have left no stone unturned to invest in state-of-the-art facilities as well as brilliant minds that would enable cutting-edge research.”
Currently, the faculty offers Master’s programs in Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Physics,  Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Genetics, Forensic Science, Environmental Science, Food Technology, Microbiology, Nutrition and Dietetics, Applied Mathematics, and Geology. What makes these programs so special is that beyond the scope of the discipline itself, the university strives to promote multidisciplinary research. To enable such advanced scientific undertakings, Parul University has established 60+ comprehensive science laboratories, complemented by a world-class library and other resources. 
Further, the 700+ industry collaborations, which to a great extent revolve around R&D, help Parul University offer a steady platform to its students and faculty to be involved in in-demand undertakings that not just have a great scientific bearing but also industry-centric relevance. Similarly, the institute participates in joint ventures with reputed bodies such as the IAMA (Indian American Medical Association) and Royal Academy of Engineering and major industry players and large-scale research projects such as Larsen and Toubro and the CABCIN project, respectively. 
Further speaking for the massive effort Parul University puts in the direction of promoting academic endeavours, either independently or via conjoined efforts, Parul University has presented 5000+ papers and filed for 128 patents and copyrights. Additionally, the university’s 75+ Global Partnerships with major educational institutes play a pivotal role in creating a synergy of ideas. Apart from being the confluence of ideas, these projects serve as a platform for aspiring scientists to learn to collaborate, an essential skill for anyone who, given the nature of the domain, wants to make a splash in the STEM fields.
Finally, to promote the advancement of scientific research, Parul University invests in human capital as Name, Designation said, “The university recognises that beyond all the facilities, world-class or not, it’s the people that truly make the institution. This is why we bring together faculty members and alumni of IITs, NITs, IISc, and other leading educational centres, creating Parul University a congregation of bright minds.”
Today, given how research-oriented the industry has become, the placement figures also hold a mirror to the impressive research abilities of the Parul University cohorts. The average package stands at 8 LPA, while the highest-grossed package is 30 LPA, while major companies including DMart, Flipkart, Godrej, ICICI Bank, BYJU’S, IndusInd Bank, Adani Gas, Patanjali, Aditya Birla Group, Colgate, Asian Paints, Amul, and  Amazon, among others, visit the campus placement drive.

In conclusion, it is clear that be it in academic output, collaboration or placements, Parul University today endeavours to top the chart in terms of every possible outcome for a robust research-centric education. In the coming years as well, the institute will continue to strive on that path of excellence.

UGC finds Jadavpur’s second report on alleged ragging ‘unsatisfactory’,The West Bengal government has also formed a four-member committee to probe into the administrative lapses in the case.,"The University Grants Commission (UGC) is learned to have found Jadavpur University’s second reply on the alleged ragging and sexual harassment of a first-year student leading to his death also “unsatisfactory”, the higher education regulator’s chairman M Jagadesh Kumar told The Indian Express. The UGC, he said, will write to the varsity again “for a detailed explanation and action.”
The UGC chairman’s statement comes a day after the Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters that the state government cannot evade responsibility for what happened.
This is the second report sent the university to the UGC. The first one too, sent last week, was found to be unsatisfactory by the Commissions as it was too “generic” in nature and didn’t list any proactive measures taken by the administration. The regulator had sought a factual and action-taken report on death of a 17-year-old student who was allegedly a victim ragging and sexual harassment.
The UGC had asked JU if an affidavit is signed by an applicant regarding clear knowledge of the anti-ragging provisions of the regulations and punishment, and whether the joint counselling is conducted for freshers and seniors within the first two weeks of the beginning of the session.
“UGC has found that the second reply sent by Jadavpur University is unsatisfactory. The Commission will soon be writing again to JU for a detailed explanation and action. Ragging is a serious issue, and JU must follow UGC regulations in letter and spirit to provide a safe environment for our students,” M Jagadesh Kumar said.
The West Bengal government has also formed a four-member committee to probe into the administrative lapses in the case. The committee is expected to turn in its report in two weeks. A total of nine students of JU, including both the current and the former, have been booked by the police in relation to the incident.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/ugc-finds-jadavpurs-second-report-on-alleged-ragging-unsatisfactory-8902249/,education

"Anand Kumar of Super 30: ‘Keep moving forward, never change your path’","Anand Kumar was awarded the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Shiksha Puraskar in November 2010, the highest award given by the government of Bihar in the field of education.","Super 30, an Indian educational centre that was started in 2002 in Patna by Anand Kumar is a programme that enrols 30 talented candidates each year from economically underprivileged sections of the country and trains them for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
With over 20 years of existence, the founder, Anand Kumar, Thursday tweeted an old photo (see below) from the early days of Super 30.
“Today after a long time I was searching for something in the old box that I found a picture of the early period. It’s been a while while teaching. In the meantime, there were plenty of people who would trap you in the trap of temptation. #super30 From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, those who earned crores of rupees were found by laying a network of franchisees. Even those with online classes keep coming with big offers,” he tweeted on X.
In his tweet, he also talked about how he has learnt to always keep moving forward and set his eyes solely on target. “But I have learned only this from life that despite all the difficulties, keep moving, keep moving forward slowly and never change your path even by mistake. That’s why I kept reading and kept teaching,” he said.
From teaching students in a small room to delivering lectures at Cambridge University, Kumar has won several awards and recognitions. Time Magazine included Super 30 in its list of The Best of Asia 2010. Newsweek Magazine included Super 30 in its list of ‘Four Most Innovative Schools in the World’. Moreover, Anand Kumar was awarded the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Shiksha Puraskar in November 2010, the highest award given by the Bihar state government in the field of education.
Bollywood also recognised his efforts by making a movie on his life and the institute, with Hrithik Roshan in the lead and Vikas Bahl as the Director.

"No proper boundary wall, lack of functional toilets — state of most Bihar govt schools","During the month-long (July) inspection of schools by the district magistrates, the Education department found that the majority of the primary and middle schools do not meet the basic requirements expected in an educational institution.","Discoloured chalkboards, no proper boundary wall and acute shortage of functional toilets— this is the state of majority of primary and middle schools of Bihar government as per the inspection reports of District Magistrates (DMs) submitted to the Education Department.
During the month-long (July) inspection of schools by the district magistrates, the Education department found that the majority of the primary and middle schools do not meet the basic requirements expected in an educational institution.
The DMs in their inspection reports had mentioned about discoloured chalkboards, lack of proper boundary walls, and shortage of functional toilets in government schools.

Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Education Department, K K Pathak in a missive dated August 16 to district magistrates has asked the latter to ensure fresh quote of black paint on all discoloured chalkboards of schools at the earliest and also maintenance of non-functional toilets under the cleanliness head of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme.
The ACS has also asked DMs to ensure the construction of boundary walls of schools (that don’t have one) as early as possible. He has also suggested steps for procuring the necessary funds for the purpose of these mandatory works.
Enthused by the outcome of regular inspection of government schools by the DMs in the state, the department recently requested all DMs to make the ‘monitoring system’ of schools in their respective areas a regular exercise now.
Pathak in his latest letter further said that even though an adequate number of toilets have been constructed in schools, only a few of them are functional.

“Those toilets which are functional are not cleaned. There are several schools which have six to eight units of toilets but only one unit is functional….there are more than 300 students in such schools”, he said, adding the department has already empanelled some private agencies at the central level for maintaining cleanliness in school campus”, the ACS said.
“These agencies would make available the services of sweeper and cleaning materials for cleaning the toilets and also cleaning the classrooms and furniture regularly. Required funds for this arrangement may be procured from the mining cess received by the districts from the state Mines and Geology department for education. Last year, different districts had got a sum of Rs 126 crore as cess, of which Rs 77 crore is still lying unutilised. This amount can be utilised in ensuring cleanliness of toilets. The cleanliness funds under the MNREGA should also be studied carefully for the purpose,” Pathak said.
Pathak also requested the DMs of 13 aspirational districts, including Araria, Aurangabad, Banka, Begusarai, Gaya, Jamui, Katihar, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, Nawada, Purnia, Sheikhpura, and Sitamarhi, to consider whether the daily cleaning of toilets can be arranged from their funds.
He asked the DMs to calculate the amount of funds likely to be raised from different sources by August 31 so that the department may sanction the remaining amount for ensuring proper cleanliness of schools and their toilets.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/no-proper-boundary-wall-shortage-of-functional-toilets-state-of-majority-of-bihar-govt-schools-8897943/,education

"While software & MBA are common routes after BTech, a super choice is innovative engineering: Former IIT Mandi Director writes","'Innovative engineers identify problems in everyday life and use technology to deliver solutions. Their power lies in thinking out-of-the-box,' writes Gonsalves.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Timothy A Gonsalves
From the phone you hold in your hand to the historic Chandrayaan 3 that blasted off from Sriharikota last month — much of our life is a feat of engineering.
Engineering brings great value to society and makes our lives easier. We cannot imagine life without electricity, the Internet, and smartphones. Soon, electric vehicles will supplant petrol and diesel vehicles, becoming a part of our lives. All of these examples use technology in innovative and creative ways.
As a young student, you can also become a part of the next technological revolution that transforms society by becoming innovative engineers.
Read | Beyond the rare Rs 1 crore package, IITs help students contribute to nation building
Innovative engineers identify problems in everyday life and use technology to deliver solutions. Their power lies in thinking out-of-the-box. The majority of students who graduate with a Bachelor of Technology or Bachelor of Engineering (BE or BTech) degree in India are not trained to be innovative engineers. Many of them take up routine jobs or leave engineering altogether.
The lucky few get jobs in companies that build products. They end up learning innovation and real-world skills through several years on the job.
In a nutshell, engineering consists of four steps.
First, identify a need of society. Second, design a solution using technology. Third, implement the solution. Finally, deliver it to customers and ensure their satisfaction.
Let us take some examples.
ADVERTISEMENT
Third year engineering students at the Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu decided to tackle the unpleasantness of wearing a bike in summer.
Also read | 'There’s more to engineering than IT jobs that offer the promise of a golden ticket', writes IIT Madras professor
They designed a helmet with a Peltier module that uses electricity to cool the inside of the helmet. As the first customers, they used the helmet while riding their bikes. All of these students are innovative engineers in their own right.
Four final year students at IIT Mandi identified that a solar panel installation in a house required tedious and costly manual inspection of the roof.
They went on to design a novel automated process using image processing of satellite images. When they graduated, they started their own company called The Solar Labs. Four years later, their startup was bought by a leading solar panel manufacturer for a large sum.

Now, the important question: How do you become an innovative engineer?
The good news is that you can also become an innovative engineer during your BTech. In BTech, you will study many science and technology subjects that are an important part of good engineering.
Equally important is to gain technical common sense through practical experience. In countries that lead in producing technology products, such as the US and Germany, young boys and girls tinker with gadgets from a young age.
However, most Indians grow up without this experience. You can make up for this during your BTech.
ADVERTISEMENT
Your college may have technical clubs where you work with technology in a practical manner. These include programming clubs, automotive clubs, among others.
When you participate in these clubs, be sure that your gadget is useful to some customers. They should use it and give you feedback.
Programmes such as LEAP from IIT Madras provide students the opportunity to conceive, design and implement useful products during BTech. A team of LEAP students from the Government Engineering College from Idukki in Kerala decided to make a robotic feeder for persons with disability. They designed a sleek robotic arm that scoops up a spoonful of food from a bowl and raises it to the lips of the user. It has proximity sensors to control its movement.
To become a good innovative engineer, start practising today. The core mantra: Identify, Design, Implement, Deliver.
ADVERTISEMENT
You might ask why some subjects like Chemistry exist in your BTech curriculum. You might say they are irrelevant to your aspirations. Technology changes rapidly. Until 2000, for example, only a few academic geeks were interested in Machine Learning (ML). No one could get a job in that field.
However, today ML is the hot field. In five or 10 or 20 years, it might not be. Chemistry may well be the most lucrative field!
ML utilises advanced statistical models on large amounts of data to gain intelligence about problems ranging from global warming to sports. Good ML is 10 per cent statistics, modeling and coding – which many people learn. The missing 90 per cent is domain expertise. Most ML “experts” know the 10% but are ignorant of the 90 per cent.
So, by learning core domains during your BTech, you can become sought after as an ML expert who knows the full 100 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
The next big question: Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robots make engineering redundant?
AI/ML learns by experience. It looks for patterns in a large amount of training data collected from the real-world. Given a new situation, it matches this with some learnt pattern. Thus, AI/ML is well suited to problems for which a large amounts of data is already available.
So, when it comes to cutting-edge research, there are many areas that are not amenable to AI/ML. One example is Chandrayaan 3 where there is no training data. The success of the project is critically dependent on innovative human engineers.

"IISc Bengaluru stops Teesta Setalvad’s entry for communal harmony talk, allows event post intervention","Students from other colleges who were invited for the discussion were turned away by the institution. Later around 45 attendees including faculty members and students of IISc, participated in the discussion.","The Indian Institute of Science (IISc ), Bangalore stopped civil rights activist and journalist Teesta Setalvad from entering the institution ahead of her talk on Communal Harmony and Justice, scheduled on Wednesday at 5 pm.
The discussion was organised by ‘Break The Silence’, a student group in IISc. According to members of Break The Silence, permission was sought from the registrar of IISc for the event to be held at the CCS Seminar Hall. However, on the day of the event, with no intimation or notice, the institution directed the security personnel to stop Setalvad from entering the campus, minutes before the event, alleged the student group.
Later, faculty members of IISc intervened, challenging the denial of entry to Setalvad. Only after their intervention was Setalvad allowed to enter the institution.

However, the discussion did not take place as planned in the seminal hall. The venue was moved to Sarvam Complex near the cafeteria and the discussion began at around 5:45 pm and went on till 8 pm.
In fact, students from other colleges who were invited to the discussion were turned away by the institution. Later around 45 attendees including faculty members and students of IISc, participated in the discussion.
The discussions revolved around topics such as evolving riot patterns, the challenges harmony, scientific rationality pose to certain ideologies, and the utilisation of social media for spreading hate. Setalvad is the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an organisation formed to advocate for the victims of 2002 Gujarat riots. In June 2022, she was arrested by the Anti Terrorism Squad of Gujarat Police for allegedly conspiring to implicate the Gujarat government functionaries in the 2002 Gujarat Riots. However, the Supreme Court granted her interim bail on the ground that she was a woman, leaving the decision of regular bail to the Gujarat High Court after which she was released from jail.

Tamil Nadu CM appeals to NEET aspirants to not harbour suicidal tendencies,"Stalin claimed that in a few months, when the political change takes place, then the NEET barriers will come crashing down.","Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has appealed to the students appearing for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test to face life with self-confidence and not harbour suicidal tendencies. The CM’s statement came after a medical aspirant allegedly ended his life.
Stalin claimed that in a few months, when the political change takes place, then the NEET barriers will come crashing down.
“Then, all those who say ‘I will not sign’ will disappear,” the Chief Minister said apparently referring to Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi’s remarks against the state’s anti-NEET bill.

“I offer my deepest condolences on the demise of student Jagatheeswaran and his father Selvasekhar (who also allegedly died by suicide). Let their deaths be the last on the altar of NEET,” Stalin said in a statement here.
Expressing shock over the recent demise of the medical aspirant Jagatheeswaran, a student from Chromepet in the city who unsuccessfully attempted to clear the entrance test, the Chief Minister said he was at a loss to console his family.
“Jagatheeswaran’s father Selvasekhar also committed suicide the next day. I am at a loss on how to console his family and friends,” the Chief Minister said.
His parents wanted to see their son, who studied well, as a medical doctor. But Jagadeeswaran “has joined the list of victims on the altar of NEET exam, which is the most gruesome incident,” he said. A spate of alleged NEET-related suicides have been reported in the state in the past few years.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I appeal that no student should ever make a decision to take away their own lives under any circumstances. The NEET, which is a hurdle for your growth, will be scrapped. The state government is actively working on the legal initiative in this direction,” Stalin said in the statement.
Recalling the Assembly resolutions demanding NEET exemption for TN, he said the Governor returned the first resolution and sent the second one to the President for assent.
“It appears that Governor Ravi wants the bill to be shelved. NEET exam has become expensive and can be afforded only by the rich,” the Chief Minister said.

Those who cannot afford to study by spending huge sums of money failed in the test, he claimed and said a situation has arisen wherein those who qualify NEET alone can join a medical college if they have money and that medical education is only for those who have money. “In spite of this, the state government brought 7.5 percent reservation for the poor students of government schools in medical colleges. But, the Governor refuses to understand. There is a doubt that he is acting like a puppet of the coaching centers,” Stalin alleged.
ADVERTISEMENT
Accusing Ravi of “conducting classes” at the Raj Bhavan by inviting students, the Chief Minister claimed the Governor “displayed his ignorance” when he had remarked that he would not sign the NEET exemption bill, an issue raised by a student’s father from Salem during an interaction on Saturday.
“The bill does not await his signature. It rests with the President. Governor has no authority as far as this is concerned, though he is giving the impression that he wields authority. No matter how many lives are lost like that of Jagadeeswaran, the heart of Governor R N Ravi will not melt. Human life has no value in the times of such stone-hearted people,” Stalin said offering his deepest condolences to bereaved family of Jagatheeswaran and his father Selvasekhar.
“Let their death be the final one on the altar of NEET. A bright future awaits you students. Be self-confident. Live and let others live. I urge you once again don’t harbour any suicidal tendencies,” the chief minister said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/tamil-nadu-cm-appeals-to-neet-aspirants-to-not-harbour-suicidal-tendencies-8891585/,education

We conducted an internal survey and based on feedback from all students and faculty, we have decided to drop one set of exams. So, now there will be two sets of exams besides routine evaluations,” Banerjee told PTI in an interview.
“We felt that the exam calendar was too packed and hence decided to reduce student burden and stress.
The decision has also been approved by the Senate and will be implemented from the ongoing semester. A maximum cap of 80 per cent weightage has been kept for the two examinations,” he added.
The IIT Council, in its meeting in April, decided that there is a need for a robust grievance redressal system; increasing psychological counselling services; reducing pressure, fear of failure and rejection among students.
The issue of student suicide, alleged discrimination, and ensuring the mental well-being of students was discussed at length during the meeting.

According to data shared in Parliament last month, IITs have reported the highest number of student suicide cases in the last five years.
From 2018 to 2023, at least 39 out of the total 98 deaths by suicide in top higher education institutions of India took place at IITs.
“In addition to existing mechanisms to deal with stress and ensure mental well-being among the students, IIT Delhi is pushing to strengthen some mentorship and interactive verticals, especially to encourage interactions with students outside the classrooms, preferably at an individual level,” Banerjee said.
“We are also increasing the frequency of ‘open house’ interactions with students besides the frequency of periodic informal dinners or meals between students and faculty in small groups through the existing Student-Teacher Interaction Council,” he added.

The institute is also facilitating faculty-student interactions via academic-domain-independent and academic-domain-dependent faculty mentorships.
Talking about student suicides Banerjee said, “Students in IITs come through an extremely competitive process, they have come into a classroom where there are so many people who are very intelligent…We have to be able to tell people how to cope with failure…this is something we are focusing on.
“We have expanded our counselling set up, we have students as well as professional counsellors in our hostels. We want to track students whose performance is deteriorating so they can be mentored accordingly,” he said.
Banerjee said, “Any suicide is tragic and it’s heartbreaking for everyone. We have to create an enabling ecosystem so that whenever a student is facing any difficulty emotionally or mentally, he or she should be able to approach someone and get the right counselling and mentorship at that stage”.

"UGC, EEC recommend against granting IoE tag to Jamia Hamdard, Jadavpur University","The Tamil Nadu government has withdrawn the proposal submitted earlier to confer the status of IoE on Anna University, they said.","An expert panel and the University Grants Commission (UGC) have recommended that Jadavpur University and Jamia Hamdard University, which were shortlisted by the Centre for granting Institutions of Eminence (IoE) status, should not be granted the tag, according to officials.
Also, the Tamil Nadu government has withdrawn the proposal submitted earlier to confer the status of IoE on Anna University, they said.
The Ministry of Education is yet to take call on the recommendations by the Empowered Expert Committee (EEC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC).
“Jadavpur University, a state public varsity had initially submitted a proposal with budget outlay of Rs 3,299 crore under the scheme. Subsequently, the Ministry had sought financial commitment from the West Bengal government for their share of funds since the scheme has a provision to fund up to Rs 1,000 crore of the proposed outlay only and to ensure continuity of funds for the implementation plans in case of any shortfall,” a top official privy to the development told PTI.
“However, the same was not agreed to by West Bengal government and it revised the proposal, first to Rs 1015 crore and then again revised steeply downward to Rs 606 crore with 25 per cent the amount to be generated by the university at its level. Noticing a significant decrease in the budget outlay, the matter was referred to UGC and EEC to examine the proposal afresh and both of them recommended the Ministry of Education to not consider the university for IoE status,” the official added.

"Beyond the rare Rs 1 crore package, IITs help students contribute to nation building: IIT Delhi professor writes","“More often than not, parents and students alike have to be reminded that a few IIT graduates getting a salary package over one crore is an exceptional outlier,” writes Prof Abhyankar.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Abhijit R. Abhyankar
Every June, people like me get a variety of questions from the parents of prospective IIT students. But the most common one is this — “Sir, what branch should we choose?”
This is a challenging question to answer — but also the simplest one at the same time.
Let me get to the simple answer first. The ever-evolving Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate (PG) academic ecosystem at IITs ensures that the academic programmes are always in tune with the changing industry landscape. So, no matter what branch a student chooses, if they are sincere throughout college, they will have a successful launch into the professional world.
But here’s when the answer becomes complex. Parents and students often look at branches – and even IITs — as a means of getting high salary packages. The fact is that they can achieve much more beyond the salary package.
I am not saying that prospective students are not passionate about their fields. However, more often than not, parents and students alike have to be reminded that few IIT graduates getting a salary package over one crore are exceptional outliers.

Hence, it is important to think of newer frameworks to introduce someone to the IIT system and its success. And my proposal is this: students joining the institutes can get an opportunity to contribute to nation-building.
ADVERTISEMENT
And this is no emotional argument. I would argue it’s a smart one, which creates a win-win situation. There is no denying the fact that every student contributes to nation-building, either directly or indirectly, and in different proportions.
However, the IIT ecosystem, in particular, is a great enabler that helps students connect to the frontier areas of immediate and future national interests and priorities. For some domains, national priorities also happen to be global priorities. Of course, the needs and the context of national and global causes change from time to time.
For example, climate change and sustainable energy are primary concerns that are bothering the entire world. A lot of focus resources will be channelled here for research, innovation, technology development, and policy.
Many of you are aware of India’s commitment to the world about going net-zero by 2070. In this direction, India has set an ambitious target of installing 500 GW of renewable energy resources by 2030.
ADVERTISEMENT
These are big commitments. To make them viable, the reliance on indigenous resources needs to go up. The entire value chain associated with these targets needs to have a dominant Indian stamp on it.
The same goes for the people who are going to drive these missions. The current and future generations of engineers graduating from top-class institutes including the IITs will have a key role to play in achieving these national targets. And with its academic programmes and research setup, IITs can be key to this project.
IITs conduct periodic curriculum review where the old programmes are revamped. New programmes are introduced to keep in tune with the recent and future trends.
For example, one of the programmes proposed by the recently announced IIT Delhi –Abu Dhabi campus is on Energy and Sustainability. This covers the entire spectrum in that space including the technology, analytics and policy aspects.

The research and consultancy projects carried out by faculty members in IITs are inextricably linked to the demands of the industry. Through these projects, the UG and PG students get an insight into real life problems.
Those getting exposure to power engineering, for example, would get a chance to get involved in designing and planning the electric transmission grid for the entire country. Those associated with chemical technology would get an opportunity to develop a disruptive technology for energy storage of the future. Those interested in communication engineering may get involved in development of a strong communication backbone for future smart networks. Add to this the many success stories of start-ups emerging out of these projects.
What can be more satisfying than working in a field of your interest and contributing to national and global causes while also getting handsomely paid for it?

The petitioner, in his PIL, has said CLAT (UG) examination “discriminates” and fails to provide a “level playing field” to students whose educational backgrounds are rooted in regional languages.
“Bar Council of India supports the issue raised by the petitioner for conducting the CLAT examination in languages other than English as the same will give opportunities to more citizens of the country to appear in the exam and pursue law as a career,” the affidavit by the BCI said.
The BCI, in its response, said according to the Legal Education Rules, English has to be the medium of instruction in both the integrated five-year and three-year law courses, but it is open to the institution to allow instruction in any language other than English.

If the medium of instruction of legal education is other than English, students have to take English as a compulsory paper, it added.
The BCI also informed that the All India Bar Examination is held in 23 languages, including English, Hindi and other regional languages.
The Consortium of National Law Universities earlier told the high court that preparedness of the upcoming CLAT-2024 is at an advanced stage and any judicial order compelling the introduction of additional language options this year without any deliberations and studies, would result in serious administrative and operational issues.
The consortium has said it has constituted an expert committee of vice chancellors of five member NLUs to study the issue of offering the CLAT exam in additional languages, besides English, and to prepare a comprehensive roadmap after reviewing stakeholders’ viewpoints and potential constraints.

The consortium, in its reply to the petition, said the report of the expert committee will enable it to make suitable advance preparation for conducting CLAT in additional languages in the coming years, after ironing out all anticipated difficulties.
The committee held its first meeting on June 25 and framed certain issues relating to the subject matter, it said.
The petitioner has contended that “in a hyper-competitive paper, they (students from non-English language background) are linguistically disempowered as they have to surpass the additional hurdle of learning and mastering a new language”. The petitioner was represented through senior advocate Jayant Mehta and lawyers Akash Vajpai and Sakshi Raghav.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/clat-2024-bci-supports-plea-for-conduction-of-exam-in-languages-other-than-english-8886077/,education

We believe that while we strive to provide superlative classroom learning, which is necessary for the theoretical foundation, what gives an extra edge to our cohort is our thrust on practical learning via opportunities such as internships and real-time projects. During these occasions, students also get the opportunity to seek mentorship from top architects and pick up the current best practices in the field from the leaders themselves. As a result of these sought-after core skills, our students stay ahead of the curve in today’s competitive job market. Plus, the soft skills and organizational behavior they acquire due to these stints, give them an additional advantage over their peers, which in other words means, a head start to their career.”
Attesting to the quality of education, especially to the emphasis on real-time project experience, it is worth mentioning that Parul University students have received lucrative offers of upto 30 LPA from leading companies such as the Reliance and Adani Group, and Larsen and Toubro. Also, aside from the core skills and soft skills, Parul University has more to offer to an aspiring architect. Given that as a subject Architecture is a fine blend of engineering and science and creativity on one hand and strong technical and academic knowledge and artistic skills on the other, Parul University’s multidisciplinary environment provides the right ambience for the students to internalize the discipline. 
Moreover, the university’s state-of-the-art infrastructure includes the Architecture Studio, Laser Cutting Laboratory, Structural Laboratory, Material Laboratory, 3D Printing Laboratory and CAB Design Laboratory. These world-class facilities help students hone their skills better as architects-to-be. Additionally, the students get the unique chance to be exposed to leading domain exhibitions, where not only can they better network but also watch the latest industry trends. Similarly, in terms of exposure, the university has forged connections with leading architects in the country. Some of the notable names are the renowned architect, Christopher Benninger, Chetan Vaidya, Director GIFT City, Ex. Director, SPA, Delhi & NIUA, Delhi, and Prof. Osamu Ishiyama, Japanese Architect and Professor of WASEDA University.
All in all, the Bachelor of Architecture program from Parul University does an excellent job of preparing students for a solid career path through engagements in real-time projects. Consequently, the cohort is adept at both domain and interpersonal skills, carrying with them and furthering Parul University’s proud legacy of excellence.

Parliamentary committee asks health ministry to check up on students who fail in exams,"""The committee is pained to observe that students and unemployed youth accounted for the highest number of suicides in India.","The health ministry has been recommended by a parliamentary committee to make a provision under 24×7 helpline to call up youths who fail competitive exams and counsel them against suicide.
The committee recommended the ministry to strengthen ways to track factors causing suicides through its National Suicide Prevention and bring their numbers down.
“The committee is pained to observe that students and unemployed youth accounted for the highest number of suicides in India.
“The Committee notes that while more students committed suicide than farmers, the latter’s suicides were termed a national crisis. However, suicides by students hardly caught anyone’s attention and were dealt with on a case-to-case basis,” it said.

The committee said the government should prioritise mental health awareness and education campaigns to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues.
“The committee recommends the ministry to make provision under its 24×7 helpline to telephonically connect with youths who fail to qualify for competitive exams like UPSC-CSE, NEET, SSC, JEE, etc, by few marks and counsel them against committing suicides,” the report said.
The committee also acknowledged the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (NSPS), which is a comprehensive plan that aims to reduce the number of suicides in the country by 10 per cent by 2030.

The committee asked the government to design mental health care services for children, adolescents, and young people, and rope in experts trained specifically to understand such people’s needs.
“There is also a lack of comparable data and evidence on the mental health problems affecting children, adolescents and young people.
“The Committee, therefore, recommends that in the NMHS-2, specific provisions should be made to generate evidence and data on mental health and psycho-social well-being of children, adolescents, youth and caregivers to understand the magnitude, trends, patterns and the prevalence of mental health and psycho-social problems among children, adolescents, youth and caregivers in India,” the report said.
The panel also recommended forming a dedicated cadre of counsellors in all schools under the ‘Manodarpan’ initiative.

School management committees should be encouraged to have inclusive learning spaces focusing on students’ social and emotional learning, it said.
The committee noted that most of the issues highlighted by the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 have remained almost the same even in 2023.
There is still a great scope to improve the treatment gap that results from the lack of mental health professionals, weak mental healthcare infrastructure, inadequate and inequitable access to mental health services, stigma and discrimination, the report said.
The committee also observed that NMHS-2015-16 was done only in 12 states out of 36 states and UTs in India, and covered only about 40,000 people – a tiny sample considering the population of the country.

It said the survey relied on self-reporting (and not clinical analysis) by the interviewees, which can be subject to recall biases and under-reporting due to the stigma associated with mental health.
The survey was limited to collecting data on certain specific mental disorders, potentially overlooking mild or moderate mental health issues like emotional breakdown, etc, that may still require support and intervention, it said.
The panel noted that the survey also failed to take into account vulnerable populations, such as homeless individuals, prisoners, and those living in institutions, which may have led to underestimating the prevalence of mental disorders.
The committee recommended the health ministry to address these issues in its next such survey and conduct a comprehensive study of mental healthcare landscape in India.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/parliamentary-committee-asks-health-ministry-to-call-up-youths-who-fail-in-exams-8877712/,education

Cambridge University launches first-ever visiting fellowship to study Indian indentured labour history,"Gaiutra Bahadur is the author of ‘Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture', a major study of the lives of Indian women who became indentured labourers to colonial plantations in the 19th century.","The University of Cambridge has created what is believed to be the first-ever visiting fellowship into the study of indentured labour, the controversial system involving millions of Indians that replaced slavery during British colonisation.
The university’s Selwyn College appointed Guyanese-American Professor Gaiutra Bahadur last week as the “Ramesh and Leela Narain visiting bye-fellow in Indentureship Studies”.
Bahadur is the author of ‘Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture’, a major study of the lives of Indian women who became indentured labourers to colonial plantations in the 19th century.

“I am honoured and delighted to be the inaugural visiting bye-fellow in indentureship studies,” said Bahadur.
“When I first began doing research in this area, the funding just wasn’t there, so it was in many ways a labour of love. That’s why I’m so happy to see there’s now visibility and funding like this to help future researchers,” she said.
Selwyn College and the Ameena Gafoor Institute, which studies indentureship and its legacy, collaborated closely in setting up the programme which allows a scholar to spend eight weeks at the university to conduct their research.
The programme will run for an initial five years.
“The study and documentation of indentureship is undoubtedly valuable, but it has barely been included in the history syllabi of British and European Universities – a staggering omission considering the millions of individuals, and indeed entire cultures, irrevocably shaped by indentureship and its legacies,” said Professor David Dabydeen, the Guyanese novelist, poet and academic who is the director of the Ameena Gafoor Institute.

“That is why this fellowship, and hopefully eventually establishing a Professorship, is so important. Cambridge has created an academic subject, bringing it from the margins to the very centre. I am immensely grateful to the Gafoor family in Guyana for helping to make all this possible,” he said.
According to the institute, in relation to the British colonial period and Empire, the largest and most concerted expression of indenture – a temporary contract between employer and labourer – occurred between 1834 and 1920, when 2 million Indians, and thousands of others from across Asia, Africa, and Oceania were exploited under a system intended to replace enslaved African labour in the Caribbean and Mauritius.
“Often recruited with false promises and misinformation, workers had little recourse to justice from a colonial project that was entirely dependent on their labour for its capital. Wherever it has occurred, indenture has almost universally included forms of abuse and exploitation,” it notes.
The study of indentureship and its legacies was one of the recommendations made in a university report on the ‘Legacies of Enslavement’ by Cambridge Advisory Group. The university said it is hoped that enough funding will eventually be raised to establish a permanent Professorship in the subject, based at Cambridge.

YEEP 2023: Parul University and Swiss Students Collaborate on Innovative Solutions,"The YEEP experience went beyond academics as the students were exposed to Indian culture through various cultural events, including festivals like Holi-Dhuleti and Diwali.","Parul University offers an exciting and immersive two-week experience for students from Switzerland during the 2023 YEEP Program. In a rapidly evolving world, innovation has become more critical than ever, and Parul University collaborates with universities worldwide to celebrate this essence of innovation.
This year’s YEEP program welcomed eight students from Switzerland to participate in a course on entrepreneurship and innovation culture in India. The students were divided into four groups, each tasked with designing solutions for specific problems related to law, travel guides, healthcare, and smart home automation technologies.
The program is a joint collaboration with the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland, aimed at providing comprehensive training in entrepreneurship and innovation. YEEP showcases the immense potential of young minds to create sustainable solutions for the future. This marks the fourth edition of YEEP, an ongoing partnership with Bern University since 2017, which includes other exchange programs, summer schools, and faculty visits, fostering strong relations between the two universities.
Throughout the program, the students were challenged with critical thinking problem statements, encouraging them to apply their knowledge and come up with innovative solutions. Notably, the students developed a wearable device for epilepsy patients that can detect seizures and alert emergency contacts. They also created LawsPlat, a platform to bridge the gap between law students and legal professionals, offering practical guidance and networking opportunities.
Additionally, the students designed Travel Guide, a platform connecting travelers with local guides to enhance their travel experience. Another breakthrough was Smart Home automation, providing convenience and remote control of appliances and devices.
The YEEP experience went beyond academics as the students were exposed to Indian culture through various cultural events, including festivals like Holi-Dhuleti and Diwali. They engaged in Indian classical dance and experienced cultural practices like the mehndi application. This cultural exchange enriched their perspective and understanding of diversity.
YEEP continues to be a platform that nurtures diversity and innovation among students from diverse backgrounds, shaping tomorrow’s inventors, creators, and entrepreneurs. Through this program, Parul University continues to foster a vibrant and inclusive campus atmosphere, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among students from different continents.

"A Lesson from IIT | Disciplined schedule and conceptual understanding are key for JEE preparation, IIT Kanpur prof writes","""The first thing that students should do is master the concepts. They should then proceed to solve problems from well-vetted books written by experts,” writes Harbola","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Manoj Harbola
I will start by recalling a conversation a few years ago I was having with students of IIT Kanpur’s Hall of Residence III, of which I was a warden at that time. During the discussion, I posed a question to the students: “How many of you still follow the daily routine you had in school?” I was very specific with that question – I wanted to know who were getting up in time to get ready to go to classes, attending them regularly, participating in extra-curricular activities, taking proper rest, doing the homework for the day, going out to play in the evening and finally finishing all the work for the day and then do whatever extra reading or work one wanted to do before going to bed.
Only two students raised their hands. I asked them what their Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) was. One said it is 9.8 and it was a little higher (maximum CPI at IIT, Kanpur is 10).
The story above is quite revealing. It tells about how effectively a disciplined life built around school education prepares students to grow well into responsible young adults ready for their university education. Evidently, performing well in competitive examinations is a byproduct of making an effort to grow into a young person whose final goal that of leading a well-rounded life. In this regard, it also helps to develop a sense of the kind of person would they like to see themselves as a few years later.

But here is a dilemma faced by a majority of students. With so much competition around, you tend to devote most of your time in preparing only for competitive examinations and do nothing else. This may sometimes also make you feel overwhelmed and give up. How do you then manage a rigorous schedule? The answer lies in taking a disciplined and efficient approach and that is the topic of discussion here.
While preparing for a competition, many students have an impression that they should be able to solve very complicated problems and therefore start by trying to do so. However, that makes your efforts inefficient. The first thing you should do is to master the concepts and solve problems from well-vetted books written by experts in consultation with school teachers, that also take into account the cognitive abilities of students at a certain level. NCERT textbooks in general fulfill these criteria well.
Consequently, it is recommended that students start their journey towards competition for admission to places of higher education with these books and then build up on that. Many JEE Main toppers of 2023, who have spoken to The Indian Express also give similar tips. The question arises: Since the number of problems in these books is limited, how does one go beyond the first step and get enough practice to solve complex problems? We address this next.
ADVERTISEMENT
While solving a problem, try to extend it to more complicated situations by asking further questions. Ask what would happen if the conditions given in the problem were altered, or if the assumptions made in the problem were different. By doing so you will be challenging yourself to see the problem from a broader perspective. In the process, newer problems are created and solved. Furthermore, doors to creating and understanding many more are opened. This allows you to set up a test paper for yourself. But do not stop here; with the kind of training that you would have given yourself, you are now ready to venture further. Therefore, you should move on to tackle more difficult problems and test papers from other resources. Along the way, take a short break from studies when you feel overburdened. You may still ask: How would I get the confidence that I have solved a sufficiently large number of problems and will not be in a disadvantageous position? I comment on this next.
During your schooling years, both the time available and the number of problems that can be solved in that time is limited. It is therefore impossible to learn about and remember ways in which all kinds of different problems are to be solved. Rather than solving an enormously large number of problems, a more effective strategy is to focus on understanding the basic principles and learning how to dissect a given problem. The former is like trying to learn a language well by reading all sentences written in it, which just cannot be done. However, having learnt the basics of a language properly, you understand and write in it well. And then you keep improving with time. Similarly, mastering a subject for a competition or otherwise is an ongoing process and is to be done in a systematic step-by-step manner. Since the speed for doing so varies for each person, it is important to pace oneself accordingly.
Following the strategies outlined in this column would hopefully make your preparations for any competition comfortable and enable you to negotiate through them with ease. My best wishes to all the young readers.

"To have a say in key IIM appointments, Centre set to appoint President as Visitor",Move likely to curb autonomy granted to 20 B-schools when IIM Act was implemented in Jan 2018; comes against backdrop of a series of flashpoints.,"In a move that could potentially curb the autonomy granted to 20 Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) in 2017, the Centre on Friday introduced an amendment to the IIM Act in the parliament, proposing to make the President the Visitor of all B-schools.
The amendment, if comes effect, will strip the IIM Board of the power to select and appoint chairpersons and directors to the institutes. Under the amendments, the Visitor will have the power to appoint the Chairperson to the Board of Governors of the institute, and nominate an individual to the search-cum-selection committee for the positions of Director, giving the government a say in these crucial calls.
The Visitor will also have the power to appoint the Chairperson to the Coordination Forum of the institute, as per the Bill.
The Visitor would also be empowered to set up an inquiry against the institute in case of suspected irregularities, and remove the institute’s director, besides allowing the Central Government to “constitute an interim Board in case of suspension or dissolution of the said Board of Governors.” While the central government does not have any power at present to order the IIMs on any matter, the amendments make it so that any directive from the Ministry of Education would have to be implemented by the institute.
This is the second attempt by the union government at curbing the autonomy granted to the 20 premier Business-schools. In December 2020, The Indian Express had reported on how the Education Ministry had a draft executive order with the Law Ministry with a proposal to empower the Government to initiate an inquiry against the Board of Governors of an institute if it’s ostensibly found to be acting in contravention of the Act. The proposal was eventually shot down by the Law Ministry as it went against the grain of the IIM Act.
These developments come five years after the IIM Act came into effect on January 31, 2018, giving sweeping powers to all 20 business schools, including appointment of directors, chairpersons and Board members. Earlier, the director was appointed by the board but with the prior approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister.
In September 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the autonomy granted to IIMs, had said, “Sarkar kahin nahi aayegi, koi babu aakar nahi baithega (Government will not interfere, no officer will have any role).”
ADVERTISEMENT
However, since then, the Government and the IIMs have been at odds on a range of issues, including the one-year MBA degree rolled out by the institutes.
In July 2020, the Education Ministry red-flagged the one-year executive MBA degree, saying it is “not in accordance with the UGC Regulations”. However, the IIMs defended their decision and continued to run the programme.
These included IIM Rohtak’s attempt at appointing its BoG chairperson by a circular resolution instead of approving the selection in a formal meeting attended by members.
In 2019, IIM Ahmedabad had appointed former Gujarat police officer, who had arrested a few police officers in 2007 in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, to its faculty. When the decision was questioned by the Home Ministry, the institute stuck to its guns citing its autonomy under the IIM Act.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, one the biggest points of the contention between the government and the IIM has been the reappointment of Dheeraj Sharma as the the director of IIM Rohtak. Sharma’s first term, it has now emerged, was illegal since he lacked the academic credentials for it. Although his reappointment was opposed by the ministry representative on the institute’s Board on this ground, the Board went ahead anyway.
Days after his reappointment, the government issued a showcause notice to Sharma asking him to explain why he had not submitted his first-class bachelor degree, which was a prerequisite for the post of IIM Rohtak director, despite being asked to.
The recent development is a departure from the stand earlier taken by the Prime Minister’s Office on the issue. In 2015, while the MoE had advocated retaining government control in the name of ensuring financial and administrative propriety, the PMO had wanted a hands-off approach. The draft law went back and forth for almost a year— from October 2015 to September 2016 — during which the Education Ministry stuck to its guns under Smriti Irani, but yielded after Prakash Javadekar took over in July 2016.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/to-have-say-in-key-iim-appointments-centre-set-to-appoint-president-as-visitor-8863377/,education

Master’s programs with Parul University’s Faculty of Applied Science: The endeavour to disseminate a keen knowledge of science,"The aim of the Vadodara-based institute of higher education, Parul University, has always been to foster in the cohort critical thinking and keen expertise in their discipline of choice.","The aim of the Vadodara-based institute of higher education, Parul University, has always been to foster in the cohort critical thinking and keen expertise in their discipline of choice. Following that vision, the Faculty of Applied Sciences has curated comprehensive STEM programs that would help the candidates bring about meaningful change to the industry and society at large, as well as contribute to the advancement of the field. Currently, the faculty offers master’s programs in Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Genetics, Forensic Science, Environmental Science, Food Technology, Microbiology, Nutrition and Dietetics, Applied Mathematics, and Geology.
Towards the cohort gaining an in-depth understanding and the ability to innovate in their domain, Parul University’s the Faculty of Science emphasizes research-based learning and comprehensive industrial exposure at the master’s level.  Taught by top educators from IITs, NITs, IISc, and other leading educational centers, this format of learning helps the student transition easily from their alma mater to the industry. The pedagogy also gears the future academic and research efforts of the candidates towards cutting-edge applications of science and technology. Further, to enable this application-focused education, the institute has established world-class laboratories equipped with modern appliances and research facilities necessary for actively pursuing the frontier areas of scientific studies. Moreover, the thrust on industrial applications in the science programs is complemented by the overall vision of the university: working to bring about positive social change.
Above all, what sets the science-related endeavors of the university apart from that of its peers is the focus on inculcating critical and analytical thinking in the candidates. Parul University reckons that much like other disciplines, science is dynamic. The methodologies and applications of the classical sciences are being increasingly questioned as more and more fundamental research is being conducted. So, while the disciplines undergo dynamic changes, reasoning, critical thinking, and analysis remain the underpinnings of scientific advancements. Thus, the mastery of critical and analytical thinking would hold the candidates in good stead amid the evolving disciplines, and hence comes the importance laid by the faculty in instilling the skills.
Delineating the vision behind the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Dr. Parul Patel, Vice President, Parul University said, “We founded the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Parul University with the aim of disseminating a keen scientific knowledge that would not just boost industry applications of core scientific concepts and push the knowledge frontier but also help the society at large. Therefore, our focus is threefold: bridging the industry-academic gap with industry-geared training, strengthening the understanding of core scientific knowledge, and helping candidates identify areas where science could play a crucial role in helping society. We are constantly working towards fulfilling these noble aims.”
With the institution’s commitment to providing global exposure to its cohort, pursuing the sciences at Parul University also opens up the coveted opportunity to imbibe diverse and international perspectives into one’s work. Also, given that scientific research is collaborative by nature, it is worth noting that the university has over 75 Global Partnerships. Finally, in terms of career development in academia, the university also helps candidates in securing positions in leading universities across the USA. Canada, Australia and Europe.
Moreover, the placement figures of the university validate the university’s robust efforts to inculcate industry-specific learning. The average package stands at 8 LPA, while the highest-grossed package is 30 LPA. The impressive placement figures are a culmination of the university’s initiatives towards practical learning with steps such as the 700+ industry collaborations. Additionally, major companies that visit the placement drive include DMart, Flipkart, Godrej, ICICI Bank, BYJU’S, IndusInd Bank, Adani Gas, Patanjali, Aditya Birla Group, Colgate, Asian Paints, Amul, and Amazon, among others. 
In conclusion, Parul University’s Faculty of Science represents the centre of education’s commitment to excellence in every way, be it in terms of benefit to the industry, society or the discipline in question. In the coming days as well, the faculty is poised to take the legacy of the institute ahead.

"From entrepreneurship to design, mechanical engineering provides multiple opportunities, writes IIT Delhi professor","“As a mechanical engineer seeking to enhance human ability, the first requirement is to have social skills such as interpersonal abilities and empathy,” writes Mukherjee.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Sudipto Mukherjee
The word “machine” comes from an ancient Greek term, meaning a system of connected parts designed to do specific tasks, especially those that challenge human abilities.
Machines are created with a specific sense of purpose. They can help us control energy and make different types of motion possible. Today, machines can handle heavy tasks from shaping car bodies to measuring small movements in the nano-meter range.
Throughout history, people have known about weaving machines and machines powered by wind and water. These machines have contributed to India’s prosperity until around 1400 AD.
A Lesson from IIT | A Lesson from IIT: Computer Science remains top choice, but research-oriented fields important, writes former IIT-Guwahati director
After 1400 AD, there were significant advancements in machine development. Crucial to this is the influence of the ideas of a philosopher named Rene Descartes.
His belief: “everybody is a machine”. He reasoned that there is no fundamental difference between machines created by humans and living bodies created by a divine force, when considering the body alone.
Due to this line of reasoning, good minds shifted their focus from studying celestial motions to creating tools that improve human life in terms of food, clothing, and housing by overcoming the unpredictability of nature and individual differences.

This then led to progress in physics and mathematics. Now, we understand equations like F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). But there are still many things we do not know. For example: we do not know why a piece of toast always falls with the buttered side down. From a distance, mechanical engineering conjures up images of fast motorcycles and sleek cars. The underlying symbolism of this is always financial rewards, intellectual stimulation, and long-term career satisfaction.
The field offers many opportunities for a successful career. One option is starting your own business. However, it is important to remember that if you choose to start a business, you will need to source work, bill, and collect payments. If you are not diligent in all these aspects, your business will not succeed. This is very different from working for a large company.

So, what does it take to become a good mechanical engineer? It is important to have a good relationship with computers early in your career. But as you seek to enhance human abilities and empower society, the first requirement is to have social skills such as interpersonal abilities and empathy.
Mechanical engineering is the right choice if you are passionate about solving physical challenges faced by humans in today’s world. The knowledge needed to provide solutions will come as you progress through a solid mechanical engineering curriculum, starting from identifying needs and ending with delivering the final product.

Many of us know how to tie our shoelaces, but we rarely understand the details of the knot itself. Are flat laces better than round ones?
These are the kind of questions that mechanical engineering can help you answer. The branch of mechanical engineering that encourages asking such questions about everyday activities and delving into the details of current solutions to evolve means that are more efficient is called design. In mechanical design, we focus on the function sought by the user or society rather than the personal expression of the creator. This need for empathy sets mechanical engineers apart from artists, even though both create new forms.
Through training in mechanical engineering, we understand that providing a quality service usually involves more than just one component. It requires assembling parts and coordinating different people and machines across space and time. Teams and coordination within them are needed to execute them. We teach structured methods to efficiently handle one-time activities like projects, or to plan processes for repeatedly delivering a single product. This aspect of mechanical engineering is classically called industrial engineering and is the precursor to programmes in management and business administration. The curriculum obviously includes team-building skills, which will benefit you whether you succeed or face challenges once out in the workforce.

The world of mechanical engineering is not deterministic, meaning it does not operate based on specific occurrences, It works with expected values, such as statistical means and variance.

Mechanical engineering is perhaps the only engineering discipline that sees designing with failure as an integral part of the design process and recognises that it is inevitable. We use terms like fatigue, wear, and pitting to describe the process of things degrading, and we have structured methods to estimate the useful life of components and plan for replacements.
Designs are rooted in data rather than personal opinions or individual experiences. Theory makes up about 40 per cent of the curriculum, with the rest being more focused on application. It is worth noting that sometimes mechanical components replace failing human joints and organs, although we haven’t yet figured out how to renew them over time like natural biological structures.
In addition to logical thinking, mechanical engineering also values visual thinking. It combines principles from physics and mathematics and allows you to use your mind and get your hands dirty. Computer tools play a big role in visualisation and digital representation, although the focus is often on using these tools rather than developing or maintaining them. Mechanical engineering is a good playing field for those who have empathy, an outward-looking mindset, resilience, and some mathematical skills.

Delhi HC permits St Stephen’s College to hold interviews for minority seat admissions,"Earlier this year, the St Stephen's College filed the present petition against DU's notification, contending that being a minority educational institution, its right to select students for admission and administer educational institution under the Constitution cannot be interfered with or taken away.","The Delhi High Court has permitted the St Stephen’s College to conduct interviews for granting admission to students under the minority quota besides taking into consideration their common university entrance test scores.
A bench headed by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma similarly permitted the Jesus and Mary College to hold interviews for the seats reserved for minority category students.
The court’s order came on applications by the two minority colleges to stay a December 8, 2022, decision of the executive council of the Delhi University (DU) insisting on 100 percent weightage for CUET 2023 score for admission to minority quota.
The applications were filed in petitions by the colleges challenging the notification.
Besides the pleas of the two colleges, the court order was also passed on a petition by a woman, Sharon Ann George, against the interviews for minority students at the St Stephen’s College in addition to the CUET.
The court, in its order, observed that in an earlier decision, it has already discussed the extent to which DU can regulate the admission of minority students and ruled that St Stephen’s has the right to conduct interviews with 15 per cent weightage for minority students, but not for non-minority students.
“Despite this observation made by this Court in the aforesaid judgment, the Executive Committee in its meeting dated 08.12.2022 has decided that for the academic session 2023-24, admission to the Undergraduate Programmes shall solely be on the basis of CUET for minority seats also,” said the bench, also comprising Justice Subramaniam Prasad.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As an interim measure, this Court directs that the admission policy as framed by this Court vide judgment dated 12.09.2022 shall be followed for the Academic Year 2023-24 and the St Stephen’s College will adopt the marks secured in the CUET with 85% weightage for CUET and the College’s interview for shortlisted candidates with a weightage of 15% for Christian minority candidates,” the court directed in its order dated July 21.
The court said there is prima face a complete lack of reasoning as to why its earlier ruling has been “given a go-by by the Respondents (DU) and indicates non-application of mind on their part while making the impugned decision”.
Admitting the petitions, the court opined that the colleges would suffer an irreparable loss if interim relief is not granted to them at this stage.
Senior advocate A Mariarputham and advocate Romy Chacko appeared for the petitioner colleges. Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj appeared for petitioner George.
Last year, the St Stephen’s College had filed another petition challenging the DU’s letter asking it to withdraw its prospectus which gave 85 per cent weightage to CUET and 15 per cent to college interview for admission to its unreserved seats in UG courses.
ADVERTISEMENT
Holding that the rights accorded to a minority institution under the Constitution cannot be extended to non-minorities, the high court had on September 12, 2022 directed the St Stephen’s College to give 100 per cent weightage to the CUET 2022 score while granting admission to non-minority students in its undergraduate courses.
It had, however, said the college has the authority to conduct interviews in addition to the common university entrance test for admitting students belonging to the minority community but it cannot force non-minority candidates to additionally undergo an interview.
Earlier this year, the St Stephen’s College filed the present petition against DU’s notification, contending that being a minority educational institution, its right to select students for admission and administer educational institution under the Constitution cannot be interfered with or taken away.
“The impugned decision of the university denying the petitioner college its right to conduct interviews for admission to undergraduate courses in the minority category is contrary to the judgment of this Hon’ble Court dated September 12, 2022 in W.P. (C) No. 8814/2022 in St Stephen’s College Vs University of Delhi which recognised the petitioner’s right to select students of minority category by conducting interviews,” the petition stated.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/delhi-hc-permits-st-stephens-college-to-hold-interviews-for-minority-seat-admissions-8863898/,education

How this Zomato delivery boy cracked NIACL exam,"For 26-year-old Vigneesh, clearing the NIACL AO exam meant earning social respect for him and his family. He believes with this, he will be able to provide a comfortable life to his aging parents.","Vigneesh DM was working in a private firm in 2019, when his father suffered from a heart attack. He turned to his company for help but they refused stating that to avail insurance benefits, employees have to be with the company for three years. That moment was etched in Vigneesh’s memory and led him to switch to the banking sector.
Today, he is an Administrative Officer (AO) at ‘The New India Assurance Company Limited.’ But his journey hasn’t been as smooth. Hailing from Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, he was born to parents who weren’t educated but encouraged him to study. He was able to secure a seat at Rajalakshmi Engineering College in Chennai. After graduating in 2017, he worked with a private company for two years till his father’s health deteriorated.

After quitting his job, he took care of his father and once everything fell back on track, Vigneesh decided to apply for a government job. Even as a child, his parents wanted him to pursue a government job as they had witnessed the kind of respect government officials got. He studied hard and joined Veranda Race coaching to prepare for banking exams.
Interestingly, Vigneesh and his parents had no bank account till 2015. His father used to travel from his village every month and give him money for his expenses. It was during his college years that Vigneesh got introduced to the banking system and understood its importance. This piqued interest in banking helped him decide which government exam he wanted to appear for. He began preparing in 2019 but then the Covid wave took over and everything got temporarily shut. The 26-year-old had to return to his hometown for some time.
In 2022, he came back to Chennai to appear for government tests for banking and insurance as his hometown doesn’t have any centres for exams. Since there were multiple exams, he chose to stay in Chennai for a couple of months. In the meantime, he picked up a job as a part-time Zomato delivery partner to manage his expenses. He earned somewhere between R 3,000 a week to Rs 10,000 a month depending upon the hours he worked for.
Sharing his Zomato experience he recalls how some people used to be really kind to him while there were times when he had to climb 12 floors to deliver an order as the elevator wasn’t functioning. He, however, ensures that he goes down to collect a Zomato order so that the delivery partner is spared some hassle.
Today, life has come to a full circle for him. Appointed as an AO in the fire and engineering department of New India Assurance Company Limited, his company asked for his parents’ details for insurance. He feels proud that he has earned social respect for his parents and himself.

"With several local languages, Nagaland urges Centre to allow teaching in English under NEP 2020","As per NEP 2020, the medium of instruction should be the mother tongue or local language until class 5, but preferably till class 8 and beyond.","The Nagaland government has urged the Centre to allow it to continue the use of English as the medium of teaching in schools instead of mother tongue as mandated by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 as the state has several tribal languages.
The implementation of NEP 2020 in the state is challenging as the state has over 20 different languages, said Kekhrielhoulie Yhome, the advisor for school education.
Nagaland has 17 recognised major Naga tribes speaking their own languages with no officially declared common dialect. English is the official language of the state, however, Nagamese — a lingua franca which is a mixture of different dialects — is used for daily conversations.
For a multi-diverse state like Nagaland, the implementation of NEP 2020 becomes difficult in the linguistic area, especially in the developing and urban areas, Yhome said, adding that mother tongue as a medium of instruction can be used in the rural areas and villages.
“We have 20-plus linguistic categories here while it is much more in the interior areas,” he said.
As per NEP 2020, the medium of instruction until class 5, but preferably till class 8 and beyond, is to be the mother tongue or local language.
Yhome said that faced with the challenge, the Department of School Education has requested the Ministry of Education to be “more flexible with Nagaland” on the medium of instruction.

“We have no option but to teach in English, especially in the urban areas,” he said while expressing optimism that the request would be considered by the Centre.
Yhome was speaking during the inaugural function of a four-day regional workshop on ‘a study of school assessments and examination practices and equivalence of boards’, organised by PARAKH in collaboration with the Nagaland Board of School Education (NBSE).
Representatives of boards from three states — Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura, besides officials of the Board of Open Schooling and Skill Education Sikkim, CISCE and NIOS are participating in the workshop, which will conclude on July 27.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/with-several-local-languages-nagaland-urges-centre-to-allow-teaching-in-english-under-nep-2020-8859199/,education

Centralised annual exams for Karnataka’s Classes 9 and 11 students soon,"Through this ‘centralised examination’ reform, the education department aims to bridge the learning gaps among high school students. However, similar to classes 5 and 8, the annual examination of 9 and 11, will have a ‘no detention policy’, if the student does not get the required passing mark.","If all goes as per plan, the Department of School Education and Literacy, Karnataka is likely to introduce a centralised annual examination for classes 9 and 11 for state board affiliated schools from this academic year, similar to the Gujarat and Kerala governments. If this is enforced, Karnataka will now have a centralised annual examination for classes 5, 8, 9 and 11, wherein the question paper will be set by Karnataka State Examination and Assessment Board (KSEAB) and the evaluation is set to happen at the school and taluk level. A proposal on the same will be submitted to school Education Minister Madhu Bangarappa and to the government for final approval.
The decision to introduce centralised annual examination for classes 9 and 11 comes in order to prepare the students to face the SSLC (10th) and second PUC (12th) board examinations, due next year. In addition, the school education department also wants to improve the learning outcomes in high school, which has taken a hit, as per many assessment reports.

The University of Strathclyde, Glasgow is offering scholarships for international students who will be joining postgraduate taught and postgraduate research courses in academic year 2023-24.

Scholarships helped displaced Afghan students find homes on university campuses across the US,"Just two days after the fall of Kabul, the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma announced it had created two scholarships for Afghans seeking refuge in the US.","As the Taliban swept back into power in Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, Fahima Sultani and her fellow university students tried for days to get into the Kabul airport, only to be turned away by gun-wielding extremists.
“No education, just go back home,” she recalled one shouting.
Nearly two years later, Sultani, now 21, is safely in the US and working toward her bachelor’s degree in data science at Arizona State University in Tempe on a scholarship. When she’s not studying, she likes to hike up nearby Tempe Butte, the kind of outing she enjoyed in her mountainous homeland.
Seeing students like Sultani rush to leave in August 2021 as the US withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years, colleges, universities and other groups across the US started piecing together the funding for hundreds of scholarships so they could continue their education outside of their home country.
Women of Sultani’s generation, born around the time the US ousted the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, grew up attending school and watching as women pursued careers. The Taliban’s return upended those freedoms.
“Within minutes of the collapse of the government in Kabul, US universities said, We’ll take one;’ We’ll take three;’ We’ll take a professor;’ We’ll take a student,’” said Allan Goodman, CEO of the Institute of International Education, a global not-for-profit that helps fund such scholarships.
The fears leading the students to quickly board flights were soon justified as the Taliban ushered in a harsh Islamic rule: Girls cannot attend school beyond the sixth grade and women, once again required to wear burqas, have been banned from universities, parks and gyms and are restricted from most employment.
Sultani is one of more than 60 Afghan women who arrived at ASU by December 2021 after fleeing Afghanistan, where she’d been studying online through Asian University for Women in Bangladesh during the pandemic.
ADVERTISEMENT
“These women came out of a crisis, a traumatic experience, boarded a plane not knowing where they were going, ended up in the US,” said Susan Edgington, executive director and head of operations of ASU’s Global Academic Initiatives.
After making their way to universities and colleges across the US over the last two years, many are nearing graduation and planning their futures.
Mashal Aziz, 22, was a few months from graduating from American University of Afghanistan when Kabul fell and she boarded a plane. After leaving, she began scouring the internet, researching which schools were offering scholarships and what organizations might be able to help.
“You’ve already left everything and you are thinking maybe there are barriers for your higher education,” Aziz said.
She and three other Afghan students arrived at Northeastern University in Boston in January 2022 after first being taken to Qatar and then a military base in New Jersey.
ADVERTISEMENT
Aziz graduated this spring with a bachelor’s degree in finance and accounting management. She plans to start working on her master’s degree in finance this fall at Northeastern.
The hurdles for students who left can include everything from needing help to overcome language barriers to getting credit for the courses they completed in their home country to affording tuition, Aziz said.
Just two days after the fall of Kabul, the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma announced it had created two scholarships for Afghans seeking refuge in the US.
Later, the university created five more scholarships that went to some of the young Afghans who settled in the area. Five more Afghans have received scholarships to study there this fall.
ADVERTISEMENT
Danielle Macdonald, an associate anthropology professor at the school, has organized a regular meetup between TU students and college-aged Afghans who have settled in the Tulsa area.
Around two dozen young people attend the events, where they talk about everything from US slang to finding jobs. Their outings have included visiting a museum and going to a basketball game, Macdonald said.
“It’s become a really lovely community,” she said.
For many young people leaving Afghanistan, familiarity with the US made the country a natural destination.
That was the case for Hamasa Zeerak, 24, and her 30-year-old husband, Hussain Saifnijat. In Kabul, Zeerak attended the American University of Afghanistan, while Saifnijat worked for a US-based technology company.
They both began studying at Rutgers University, in New Jersey, last fall. He may be able to graduate as early as this fall with a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering. She is studying to get her bachelor’s degree in business administration and graduates in 2025.
ADVERTISEMENT
“My worries were a lot at the beginning because I was thinking about how to continue our life in America; how can we find a job?” Zeerak said. “It was stressful at the beginning but everything goes smooth.” Sultani, like many others who left Afghanistan, often thinks about those who remained behind, including her sister, who had been studying at a university, but now must stay home.
“I can go to universities while millions of girls back in Afghanistan, they do not have this opportunity that I have,” Sultani said. “I can dress the way I want and millions of girls now in Afghanistan, they do not have this opportunity.”
There will be 20 Afghans studying this fall at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green. Atifa Kabuli, 46, had studied nursing there for the last two semesters but now is focused on studying for exams that will allow her to practice medicine in the US.
Older than most of the arriving students, Kabuli left behind her career as an a obstetrician and gynaecologist. During the Taliban’s first rule, from 1996 to 2001, she was only able to continue her education by studying in Pakistan.
ADVERTISEMENT
When the Taliban regained control, she knew she and her husband would have to leave so their daughters, now 15 and 10, would be able to continue going to school. Her time at WKU, she said, helped her find the confidence to pursue a medical license in the US.
Since the initial flurry of scholarships, efforts to assist Afghan students have continued, including the creation of the Qatar Scholarship for Afghans Project, which has helped fund 250 scholarships at dozens of US colleges and universities.
But there are still more young people in need of support to continue their educations in the US or even reach the US from Afghanistan or other countries, explained Jonah Kokodyniak, a senior vice president at the Institute of International Education.
Yasamin Sohrabi, 26, is among those still trying to find a way to the US Sohrabi, who had been studying law at American University of Afghanistan, realized as the withdrawal of US forces neared that she might need to go overseas to continue her studies. The day after the Taliban took Kabul, she learned of her admission to WKU but wasn’t able to get into the airport to leave Afghanistan.

A year later, she and her younger sister, who also has been accepted at the university, got visas to Pakistan. Now they are trying to find a way to get into the US Their brother, who accompanied them to Pakistan, is applying to the school, as well.
Sohrabi said she and her siblings try not to focus on what they have lost, but instead on how to get to the US to continue their studies.
“That’s one of the things in these days we think about,” she said. “It keeps us going.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/scholarships-have-helped-displaced-afghan-students-find-homes-on-university-campuses-across-the-us-8857711/,education

"Indian employers focus more on degrees, US prefers skills: Survey","However, the same trend has not been observed in the US, where employers are more interested in the skills, rather than the degrees.","Indian employers are more interested in hiring graduates from business schools, according to a survey of corporate recruiters recently released by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). The survey has revealed that communication, data analysis, and strategy are currently among the most important skills for business school graduates.
As per the survey, employers believe that business schools can offer an advantage over talent without a graduate management education. Employers from Asia and Fortune 500 companies hire majorly from “leading” business schools. This also revealed that even after Covid pandemic, employers tend to give preference to candidates who have attended in-person programmes over those with online degrees or micro-credentials only.
However, the same trend has not been observed in the US, where employers are more interested in the skills, rather than the degrees.
“Graduates of online business degrees should talk about their credentials differently depending on the employer — employers in Asia are more likely to value the degree itself, while US and consulting employers would rather hear about specific skills candidates attained,” suggested Andrew Walker, director of research analysis and communications at GMAC and the author of the report. “Micro-credentials in and of themselves are less likely to impress employers compared to graduate business degrees though the skills they bring are appreciated by some employers.”
Interestingly, despite reported recession concerns, 2023 hiring plans have come up on a positive note, with some anticipated growth in hiring among business master’s compared to actual 2022 results.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/indian-employers-concerned-about-degrees-us-prefers-skills-survey-8857344/,education

CUET UG common counselling platform for Central Universities likely to be launched next year: UGC Chief,"With this common counselling system, UGC is hoping to streamline the UG admission process the way IITs do it.","Several students have complained that since colleges/universities do not make their cut-offs public now, students are left blindsided in getting admissions to central universities (CU). However, the University Grants Commission (UGC) Chief, M Jagadesh Kumar, said a project for common counselling is in the pipeline.
“Next year, we may come up with common counselling for all the central universities,” M Jagadesh Kumar told indianexpress.com.
The CUET common counselling process will function almost in a similar manner to the way IITs conduct JEE (JoSAA) counselling for admission in IITs and NITs. “In that case, you (students) need to apply only on a single portal and give your choice of different universities for admission,” Kumar explained.

With this common counselling system, UGC is hoping to streamline the UG admission process. “Once that is launched, the admission process in the central universities will be much more streamlined and it will be easier for students to apply,” he said.
The portal is still under process and the UGC will announce the details soon. The counselling process will be led by a committee consisting of a few central universities.
“This will make the admission process much easier for students and there is a very little chance of seats going vacant, and students can appear for multiple universities,” Kumar added.
When asked about the current college allotment and the allegation of students being left blindsided in the process, UGC Chief assured that the authorities have tried to keep the process “completely transparent, and we try that students should know which college and course they have been allotted.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cuet-ug-2024-common-counselling-platform-likely-to-be-launched-next-year-8846727/,education

"With generative AI tools on the rise, what will the future of work look like? IIT-Bombay professor writes","'Future opportunities will lie in the creation of new knowledge either by engaging in work that is original or solving problems that have not been solved before. This means entrepreneurship,' writes professor Arya","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Kavi Arya
What is the outlook that we need in an increasingly uncertain future of work? This is a future with geo-political and economic uncertainty and global warming.
Add to this state of flux an environment in which jobs are increasingly being taken over by automation and machines, with it being clear that Artificial Intelligence-inspired technologies are here to stay and will dramatically change our lives.
Read | How AI is generating new kinds of jobs, explains IIT Ropar professor
This means that any low-skill jobs, be they in manufacturing, software development, and media are soon going to be taken over by machines. Newspaper reports already have stories of copywriters in America losing their jobs and ending up with alternative careers.
Television channels are testing out new anchors that are totally artificially generated. With new programming tools, programmers are becoming more productive, so we need fewer programmers to do the same work. The story goes on to other spheres.
Those who have used ChatGPT and other generative-AI models have discovered the science of “prompt engineering”. Designing better prompts will help us get the solution that we’re looking for. But ChatGPT still depends on human expertise to spot when it “hallucinates” and gives a wrong answer.
Even prompt engineering will eventually be replaced by the skill of articulating a problem to the system for it to solve itself. ChatGPT is still really a glorious search engine that responds based on the existing realms of knowledge that it’s been trained on. Through Google searches, for example, we get thrown many answers that we need to sift through to find the one we’re looking for. However, ChatGPT gives a measured and nuanced response.

AI systems will soon become intelligent to a degree that we need to develop less skills with prompts. So, future opportunities will lie in in the creation of new knowledge either by engaging in work that is original or solving problems that haven’t been solved before.
A Lesson from IIT | A Lesson from IIT: Computer Science remains top choice, but research-oriented fields important, writes former IIT-Guwahati director
In other words, engaging with life in a more entrepreneurial manner to create novel work is going to be crucial. This entrepreneurial spirit could help create products, services, intellectual property or even startups whose purpose is to fulfil as yet unmet market needs.
However, the market for creating new services is limited in the contracting advanced economies of the world. In India, however, there’s a certain optimism. This is because we are a fast-growing economy with a huge appetite for new products and services for an increasingly affluent and demanding population of over 1.4 billion people. Half this population is below the age of 29 years.
If we import future solutions from abroad, we pay 10x the amount required for us to make them locally. There are huge opportunities in building and delivering products and services for our own growing economy where every problem is an opportunity for a startup. The bigger the market, the bigger the opportunity.
ADVERTISEMENT
But where’s the trained human resource to build these new products and services? Our entire education system is geared towards rote learning and passing exams. Most students are still taught to believe that if they do well in exams, they’ll get a good job.
There is a risk-averse attitude in our society strongly biased against entrepreneurial pursuits. However, the job market today is demanding youngsters with state-of-the-art skills and a host of other abilities.
The school system and higher-education system is hard pressed to deliver young people with such skillsets and the “equipment” to “surf” modern life and its challenges.
Life after IIT | Life After IIT: Unemployed at 40 or employed till 80? IIT Delhi professor shares insights
For instance, a core quality demanded by entrepreneurship is empathy and a desire to engage with societal problems. Where do we train our students to be perceptive to their surroundings?
ADVERTISEMENT
Where do we train them with critical thinking abilities? And on the ability to actually solve problems and to do whatever required – self-learn, collaborate and work with teams – to get the job done?
Further, we need the knowledge of how to raise money and also specialised updated knowledge of technology to give us an edge in the market.
For the lucky ones who get to the IITs, NITs or top institutions and those able to go abroad, this aspect is more or less taken care of. But what about the others? The government is making a valiant effort to change the education system through policy initiatives such as the NEP 2020.
This makes a heavy demand on an educational system that has hitherto been rigid with human resources that still need to be trained in the new mold. Young people are impatient and cannot be kept waiting, so they address this by innovatively exploring the bounty of the internet.
ADVERTISEMENT
Students of all ages are going online to learn from Khan Academy, Coursera, among other ed tech resources, to prepare themselves for the future. This has boosted fortunes of a host of other companies making us believe that we have the answer.
But this is not enough. We need students taking lives in their own hands and building a portfolio of skills to help them discover their passion and to direct them to their destination – whether employment, a higher degree or a startup.
One good place to acquire these skills is the plethora of competitions that help one’s resume stand out from others. In India, we have various flavours, from “pure competitions” such as Smart India Hackathon (GoI) for small teams or Robocon for large teams representing colleges. Then there is e-Yantra Robotics Competition from IIT Bombay, that trains participants in futuristic technology stacks through “themes” or problem statements where both “hard” and “soft” skills are exercised in a six month long experience. The outcomes are top rate placements, the urge to higher degrees and even start-ups with the prize being a coveted six-week internship at IIT Bombay.
Finally, to reiterate: the world is looking for self-assured intelligent young people with the empathy to solve societal problems, the curiosity to ask questions and ability to solve these problems.

Student with AIR 99 in JEE-Advanced chooses MIT over IIT for ‘research opportunities…flexible curriculum’,"“Research appeals to me more than a tech job…My journey towards JEE was a result of the general mentality of an Indian household,” says Mohammed Sahil Akhtar from Kolkata, who is the only one out of the top 100 rankers this year to opt out the IIT counseling process.","Nurturing the IIT dream like many Indian students, Mohammad Sahil Akhtar from Kolkata has been preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) since class 10.
He did the rounds from school to coaching class, put in over 10 hours into studying every day, and his efforts paid off — he got the 99th rank in the All-India merit list for the JEE-Advanced 2023. But the 17-year-old has decided to drop out of the JEE admission process, the only one of the top 100 JEE-Advanced rankers to do so this year, to head to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) instead. His reason: more research opportunities and a flexible curriculum.
“Research appeals to me more than a tech job. In India, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was an option. But MIT offers more flexibility. Unlike in the Indian higher education system, I do not have to decide on my final major in the first year itself. There is yet so much that I have not seen,” says Sahil who is looking at pursuing a double major in computer sciences and physics. He is also interested in astronomy, astrophysics and data science.
JEE Advanced 2023 | AIR 1 | AIR 2 | AIR 3 | AIR 4 | Female topper | Overall analysis | Seat matrix | 
Sahil admitted the choice was not conventional, especially with the IIT brand being coveted by many. Explaining it to his parents would also have been difficult, he added. However, he said they could see his interest in research when he became the Gold medallist at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) in 2022.
“Generally, the most sought-after route is to join an IIT in Computer Science Engineering (CSE). My parents would have suggested considering IIT Bombay.”
It was also at the IOAA Olympiad, held in Georgia, that he realised the different options available in front of him, suited to his interests.

“The team from America had 10 members. Most of them were going to join MIT and shared some insights. A senior from my own team was also applying to Oxford University and spoke to me about the education system in these universities abroad. I was intrigued and started my process of applying to institutes abroad.”
He then went on to apply to Oxford University, Harvard University, Princeton University, Stanford University, and MIT. He received his MIT acceptance letter in March.
Sahil said, “There was no dependency on any entrance test or a rank for admission. I appeared for the Standard Admission Test (SAT). But more than the SAT score, admission to MIT was based on the institute’s admission committee’s assessment of my application which included my overall academic records, achievements in academics as well as in extra-curricular activities, essay and recommendation letters from my school teachers,” said Sahil, who studies at the Delhi Public School (DPS) in Kolkata’s Ruby Park.
Sahil appeared for the JEE in April.
“My journey toward JEE was a result of the general mentality of an Indian household. If you are good at studies and doing well in mathematics, JEE is one of the most important examinations.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sahil’s elder brother, currently a final year student of Engineering Physics at IIT Delhi, had provided tremendous mental support for him. “More than academics, it was about guiding me on where to focus more and how to approach the preparation,” he said, adding that he took his brother’s advice seriously given that he had appeared for JEE Advanced and knew the IIT system from within.
Sahil has recently started a YouTube channel to assist aspirants like himself in navigating the sea of expectations and advice. He said, “I have recently started a YouTube channel to help young individuals like me with topics such as advice on JEE, exploring other available options, and the process of applying to foreign universities.” Sahil emphasised how such videos had been beneficial to him. According to him, when suggestions and guidance come from someone relatable, “Their advice has a touch of realism to it,” he said.
At MIT, Sahil said he hopes to explore his interests in linguistics and philosophy. He has got a scholarship, which has “brought the cost to how much we would spend at IIT”.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/student-with-air-99-in-jee-advanced-drops-out-of-iit-admission-process-chooses-mit-for-research-opportunities-flexible-curriculum-8848589/,education

Life in a Foreign University: How I chose to study International Trade in South Korea’s Pusan National University,Delhi boy Arbaz Hussain got a fully funded scholarship to South Korea. He is currently pursuing MA in international trade from Pusan National University.,"(This letter is part of a series by The Indian Express where we bring to you the experiences of students at different foreign universities. From scholarships and loans to food and cultural experiences — students tell us how life is different in those countries and things they are learning other than academics)
—Arbaz Hussain
When it comes to higher education abroad, South Korea is quite an offbeat destination. However, over the years, the number of students and youth going there is rising. When my friend’s sister went there to pursue higher education on a fully paid scholarship, I was intrigued to look for more courses there. I always dreamt to study abroad and was already researching for a good foreign university.
Study in South Korea through fully funded scholarships
To encourage foreign students, South Korea provides various scholarships. I applied for the Global Korea Scholarship. It did not have an application fee and once you get the scholarship, everything including the airfare to South Korea is paid by the government.

Unlike many European countries where you have to get selected for a college in order to get a scholarship, here you can apply to both simultaneously. You can apply through two tracks — the embassy track and the university track. I applied through the former and the application process was fairly easy. You have to fill out the application form and choose three universities (two in group A and one in group B) along with the course you want to apply for. I don’t know much about the application process through the university track.
The three universities I chose were — Yonsei University (Type A), Seoul National University (Type A) and Pusan National University (Type B). The documents needed to apply for the universities and scholarship were Class 10 and 12 marksheet, university transcripts, two letters of recommendation (LoRs), study plan, Statement of Purpose, medical fitness and if you have extra certificates such as English and Korean languages proficiency then those as well.
Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
Since I applied through the embassy track, I had to submit the documents to the Ministry of Education. Then it goes to the Embassy of Korea for scrutiny. Once it is done, they call you for the interview. In my panel, there were two Korean representatives and one MoE representative.
I got the scholarship as well as admission to Pusan National University. I started with International Studies as my major but did not find it very interesting so I later switched to International Trade, since I graduated with a BCom (Bachelors of Commerce) from Jamia Millia Islamia. Once I came to Korea, I had to study the Korean language for one year before beginning my course. I studied at Kangwon National University from March 2021 to February 2022. I know Korean till TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) level 5, and the highest level is 6.
ADVERTISEMENT
I then joined my college in March 2022 and I will graduate in February 2024. My course is taught both in English and Korean, and we can opt for either language. As for future plans, I want to stay in Korea for some time after my PG and find a job here. While, I am open to working at other places as well, in the long run, I would like to return to India.
South Koreans– their lifestyle, food and culture
Busan and Seoul are the biggest cities in the country and are expensive as well. People here have good disposable money and the standard of living is high. South Korea is about to surpass Japan in terms of per capita income.
Though we are given a monthly allowance to bear our expenses, the government doesn’t provide us with accommodation. I live by myself in a one room kitchen apartment. Though a little expensive, it’s still spacious and comfortable.
Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
I generally cook my own food. Additionally, there are Indian stores from where you can order. However, though I am a non-vegetarian it is not very difficult for me. The only dietary restriction I have is pork. But people who are vegetarian will find it very difficult to sustain themselves as the food is mainly non-vegetarian. The food here is a little more expensive than in India, for example, milk is around Rs 200 per litre while something like red masoor dal is around Rs 350 per kilo.
Friends in a foreign land
ADVERTISEMENT
I have made friends here and my closest friends include people from Italy, Cambodia, USA, France, Uzbekistan and Korea. There are two Indians in my class.
The teachers here in Korea are very polite and helpful at all times. They would never disrespect or scold a student, especially in front of anyone. They are very cautious about how they are dealing with a student. Sometimes, the language might act as a bit of a barrier as teachers can have a certain accent or their grammar might be a bit off the place but they try their best. The teaching process, however, is not completely different since it is Asian, it is about memorising.

Whenever I feel homesick, I call up my parents or friends. If that doesn’t work, I go out with my friends here. I went home in January this year.
Travelling around South Korea
I often go out and explore the city and not just eat out or so, I go trekking, to beaches and more. Busan is quite a large city, in fact, the second largest city in South Korea. It is very beautiful and has a lot of things to explore — from beaches to mountains, so I go out twice a month. Other than that, I go out of the city once every two months or so. I have been to Jeju Island, Gangneung and even Pyeongchang, where the 2018 Winter Olympics were held.

Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
Research well before studying abroad
For students who want to study abroad, I would suggest they be clear with what they want to study, the course, the university and everything. They should sort out their finances and not fall prey to the agencies that claim to get them admission to foreign universities and if possible they should try for scholarships. For students wanting to study in Korea, please check the course and language requirements for it like in which language the classes will be held. The culture and food are different and if you have some specific dietary restrictions then it might be a problem, but overall it is a good experience.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-a-foreign-university-how-i-chose-to-study-in-south-koreas-pusan-national-university-study-abroad-8848576/,education

NEET UG 2023 Results: Why are there joint toppers again this year? Tweak in tie-breaking rules holds the answer,"Last year, four candidates with the exact same percentile score were not tied at the top spot, but instead given unique ranks. So why do we have joint toppers this year? We asked NTA this question and here's what they told us..","Following a year’s break, we once again have two candidates — Prabhanjan J, hailing from Villupuram, Tamil Nadu, and Bora Varun Chakravarthi from Andhra Pradesh — tied at the top spot in the NEET-UG results released Tuesday night. Interestingly, last year, despite four candidates achieving the same percentile score of 99.9997733, they were all awarded unique ranks. So, what could be the reason behind the National Testing Agency (NTA) announcing joint toppers this year?
Also Read | NEET 2023 Topper: AIR 1 Prabhanjan J attributes success to rigorous practice with NEET-pattern questions
The answer lies in the tie-breaking rule employed by the NTA. This year, the testing agency excluded two factors from last year’s formula. In 2022, it used the following nine factors to assign each candidate a unique rank in case two or more obtained equal marks/percentile scores:
a. Candidates achieving higher marks/percentiles in Biology (Botany and Zoology), followed by
b. The candidate with the highest mark/percentile in Chemistry, followed by
c. The candidate who achieved the highest marks/percentile score in Physics in the test, followed by
d. Candidates with fewer incorrect answers than correct answers in all subjects in the test, followed by
e. A candidate with the lowest proportion of incorrect responses to correct responses in Biology (Botany and Zoology) is the winner, followed by

In other words, a candidate’s age and application number were not factors in determining different ranks for candidates with equal or perfect scores. This meant that points (a) to (g) of the formula proved to be sufficient in breaking ties for all candidates, except two — Prabhanjan J and Bora Varun Chakravarthi.
“Since both have scored a perfect score of 720 marks and there were no incorrect answers, it was impossible to break the tie between them as points (a) to (g) of the formula did not yield any useful results,” said an NTA official. “Hence, only two candidates were tied in the entire rank list, and those happened to be Prabhanjan J and Bora Varun Chakravarthi, who had a perfect score,” he added.

When asked why the NTA did not include the candidate’s age and application number, like last year, in its tie-breaking mechanism, the officer said, “The formula we used ensured we could give a unique rank to everyone except two. That would not have led to problems in admission. So, the result committee (with representatives from the health ministry) felt we should let the two be joint toppers.

Last year, NTA introduced a 9-point tie-breaking formula, to avoid repeating what happened in 2021. That year, the top three candidates were still tied despite the following formula given below and hence all were given Rank 1.
1. Candidate obtaining higher marks/percentile score in Biology (Botany & Zoology) in the test, followed by,

2. Candidate obtaining higher marks/percentile score in Chemistry in the test, followed by,
3. Candidate with less proportion of a number of attempted incorrect answers and correct answers in all the subjects in the test
According to the NTA official, having joint rank holders is not an optimal scenario, particularly in the context of medical colleges where the number of available seats is limited. Hence, in 2022, the NTA replaced the above formula with the nine-point one. But this year, it dropped age and application number from the formula.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/neet-ug-2023-result-why-joint-toppers-again-this-year-tweak-in-tie-breaking-rules-8661618/,education

While celebrating with his friends and family members Tuesday night, Advani told The Indian Express that his passion for science, particularly Biology, blossomed in class 5. Alongside his preparations for admission to AIIMS, Delhi, Advani is also gearing up for the upcoming International Biology Olympiad 2023, set to take place from July 3. He proudly represents the Indian team in the prestigious event.
Advani explains that he was keen on pursuing a career in medicine because he has always wanted to help people. “I have always wanted to help people, which is why I chose medicine. Additionally, my parents and family members have been involved in service-oriented careers. My passion for science, especially Biology, began in class 5. Biology is my favorite subject. These factors motivated me to pursue medicine,” said Advani, a student of GR International School, Bengaluru, who secured 99.4 percent in the Class 12 CBSE examination.
In fact, Advani’s grandfather is a general specialist and a cardiac physician, while his aunt is a neurophysician. “Both of them are my role models in medicine. Right now my specialisation would be in neurology and that comes from my aunt,” he said.

As for preparations for NEET examination, Advani trained at a private coaching centre. However, he followed a personalized learning approach that was based on his needs, without adhering to fixed study schedules. “I used to study only when I felt like it or when there was a need. Fixed schedules never worked for me. If there was an upcoming examination, I would study accordingly. It was all based on my needs. If there was a specific concept I didn’t understand, I would study it. I typically invested around two to three hours per day,” shared Advani.

Committee to be formed for full textbook revision next year: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah,The chapters were introduced during the term of the previous BJP government with Rohith Chakarathirtha at the helm of the textbook revision committee.,"Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in a meeting with Jnanpith Awardee Chandrashekar Kambar Tuesday said the government will form a committee to undertake the full revision of school textbooks next year.
The statement comes at a time when the ruling Congress is making efforts to drop certain ‘controversial’ chapters in the school textbooks for Social Science and Kannada. The chapters were introduced during the term of the previous BJP government with Rohith Chakarathirtha at the helm of the textbook revision committee.
According to officials in the school education department, the controversial chapters would be dropped and replaced by old chapters which were recommended by the earlier Baraguru Ramachandrappa textbook revision committee. “Works are already underway to review and drop controversial lessons such as the chapter on RSS founder K B Hedgewar, works of Bannanje Govindacharya, and Chakravarthy Sulibele, among others,” said a source.

The government is likely to issue a government order in this regard soon and then distribute booklets including clarifications in connection to the dropping of the controversial chapters. The schools will be directed to not teach the dropped chapters and not consider them for examination purposes.
Ramachandrappa met with Siddaramaiah a week ago and advised him not to go for a full revision as it was not a practical and viable option. He also recommended that the government can refer to the works of previous textbook revision committees and include some chapters suggested by them.
Textbook revision is one of the many pre-poll promises of the Congress. Textbook revision has been in the news since the erstwhile BJP government appointed Chakrathirtha as the chairman of the textbook revision committee. Chakrathirtha, who was earlier booked for insulting the state anthem, was accused of ‘saffronising’ the textbooks by including works of right-wing ideologues and dropping the works of noted novelists and literary icons like P Lankesh, and Sara Aboobacker, among others.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/committee-full-textbook-revision-next-year-karnataka-cm-siddaramiah-8661242/,education

Karnataka records high drop out rates at secondary level in government schools: PAB meeting minutes,"The report also noted with 24,765 vacant posts of teachers in government elementary schools, the vacancies need to be filled on priority.","Karnataka is among the five states across India that recorded a high drop rate in government schools (14.6 per cent), higher than the national average 12.6 per cent. This information was recorded as part of the minutes of Planning Approval Board (PAB) meeting held with different states between April to May for the financial year 2023-24. The other states are Gujarat, Bihar, Assam and Punjab.
The minutes of the meeting stated that Karnataka’s drop out rate at the secondary level stood at 14.6 per cent for 2021-22 and the state needs to continue taking adequate measures to reduce the dropout rate and improve the retention rate. While the dropout rate has improved from 16.6 per cent recorded for 2020-21, the state has not yet identified drop-outs in the age group of 16-19 years.

Further, the net enrolment rate (NER) has also declined at primary, upper primary and secondary level from year 2020–21 to 2021-22. The state was advised to focus on improving the NER at these levels by bringing back children to the age appropriate classes.
The minutes also recorded that the transition rate from secondary to higher secondary also saw a decline with less than 60 per cent in five districts. The report also noted with 24,765 vacant posts of teachers in government elementary schools, the vacancies need to be filled on priority. In fact, the vacancy has increased from 13.4 per cent in 2022-23 to 13.71 per cent in 2023-24.
In terms of learning outcomes, Karnataka still needs to work on providing quality interventions to improve the learning outcomes of the students. However, the state has shown improvement under access outcomes (C-1, D-2), but needs to focus on the Adjusted Net Enrolment Rate at secondary level and take steps for identifying out of school children and their mainstreaming.

The state has also reportedly shown maximum improvement under infrastructure and facilities and was encouraged to take more measures to reach the top grade, with specific focus on areas where the performance is low.
Speaking to The Indian Express, a school education department official attributed the school dropout rates to various social factors. “In rural Karnataka, especially in the north, children are sent to work on fields at an early stage. In backward regions like Chitradurga, Yadgir and other districts, access to education for girls is a major challenge. Moreover, minority communities also stop sending their children to schools after some point of time,” said a government official.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/karnataka-records-high-drop-out-rates-at-secondary-level-in-government-schools-pab-meeting-minutes-8661061/,education

"DU Admissions 2023: UG courses can admit only 20% of supernumerary seats under ECA, sports quotas","""The number of seats under both categories was calculated college-wise but now will be done programme-wise,"" the official said.","The Delhi University has revised the norms for undergraduate admissions under the extracurricular activities (ECA) and sports quotas, capping the intake in a course to 20 per cent of total supernumerary seats in a college, an official said on Monday.
The move was approved by the DU’s Executive Council last week. However, council members rejected the university’s plan to give equal weightage of 2.5 per cent of supernumerary seats to the ECA and the sports quotas.
The members pointed out that there are several colleges, especially the all-women institutions, where the majority of admissions to supernumerary seats are done under the ECA category and not sports, the official said.
Supernumerary seats are those that are over and above the intake approved for a college. There are two categories under which admissions to supernumerary seats are done — ECA and sports quota. The maximum number of supernumerary seats in a college is capped at five per cent of its total intake.
“By introducing the 2.5 per cent clause, we wanted to bring parity. But some members pointed out that there are women’s colleges where the majority of supernumerary seats are filled under the ECA quota. So, we decided that the representation of at least 1 per cent under each category will be mandatory and the college can decide on the rest,” the official said.

The number of seats under the two categories will now be calculated programme-wise, and not college-wise as was the case earlier, he said.
“The number of seats under both categories was calculated college-wise but now will be done programme-wise,” the official said.

“Until now we used to ask the colleges how many students they would take in these two categories. Now, we will ask for a course break-up and we have put a rider that a course cannot take in more than 20 per cent of total supernumerary seats,” he added.
The number of supernumerary seats will not be impacted by the changes and candidates must appear in CUET (UG)-2023 to avail of the quota under the two categories, the official further said.
For the admissions, a weightage of 25 per cent will be given to CUET score and 75 per cent to certificates, trials and performances",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/du-admissions-2023-ug-courses-admit-only-20-percent-supernumerary-seats-eca-sports-quotas-cuet-ug-2023-8659934/,education

‘Pandemic contributed to student mental health issues’: IIT Madras director on suicides,"In an interview to The Indian Express, IIT Madras Director V Kamakoti discussed factors that give his institute an edge over renowned institutions like IISc in NIRF, plans for a branch campus in Zanzibar, efforts to address the underlying causes of campus suicides, and the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence.","Despite its consistent dominance in the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras continues to remain absent from the world’s top 200 rankings.

In an interview to The Indian Express, IIT Madras Director V Kamakoti discussed factors that give his institute an edge over renowned institutions like IISc in NIRF, plans for a branch campus in Zanzibar, the entry of foreign universities in India, efforts to address the underlying causes of campus suicides, and the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence. Professor Kamakoti is a cyber security expert and the man behind India’s first indigenous computer microprocessor, ‘Shakti’. Edited excerpts:
Q. As IIT Madras continues to beat IISc in the NIRF ‘overall’ category for the fifth consecutive year, what factors help your institute maintain an edge over an institution like IISc?
IIT Madras is a teaching and research institution, but we’re more of a teaching institution. We have a student body of 12,000 and a substantial online programmes. In contrast, IISc, which I personally visited and found to be exceptional, has a greater emphasis on research and a smaller student population. The NIRF rankings consider various parameters like teaching-learning effectiveness, student strength, graduation outcomes, diversity, and inclusivity. We do well in these areas. But research is also a significant factor where IISc outperforms us. Each institute has its unique character and DNA.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-madras-director-v-kamakoti-pandemic-has-contributed-to-student-mental-health-issues-8657716/,education
"‘Deeply concerned over engineering students pursuing non-core jobs, it’s a waste of resources,’ says IIT Madras director","The IIT Madras Director also said that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are still evident on campus, with remote learning significantly reducing students' attention span and the lack of socialisation among peers adversely affecting their mental health.","The director of the country’s top-ranking Indian Institute of Technology, IIT Madras, V Kamakoti, said more and more engineers opting for non-engineering career choices is a “waste of resources”.
In an interview to The Indian Express, Kamakoti, a cyber security expert and the man behind India’s first indigenous computer microprocessor ‘Shakti’, said, “I am deeply concerned about the current situation. With India’s increasing number of infrastructure and aviation projects, I worry about the availability of civil and aerospace engineers. Recently, during my travels, I have met alumni from IIT Madras who pursued careers in big four companies, such as marketing or high-frequency trading. When asked about their (engineering) background, it becomes apparent that their career choices are completely unrelated to what they have studied. It’s a waste of resources.”

"‘No thank you, we decline your generosity’: Yadav, Palshikar clap back at NCERT","In a continuing war of words between the NCERT and its two former chief advisors, Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar issued another statement Saturday reacting to the Council's rejection of their demand to have their names removed from political science textbooks. ""If the name of the Textbook Development Committee is there to acknowledge our contribution, as the NCERT claims, then we must be free to decline this generosity,"" their statement reads.","Expressing disappointment with NCERT‘s rejection of their request to remove their names from the rationalised political science textbooks, Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar issued a public statement on Saturday, stating that if NCERT had the legal authority to “distort and mutilate” educational material, then they should also be able to exercise their “moral and legal right” to disassociate themselves from books they do not endorse.
Their statement reads: “The continuation of our names inside the present version of the book creates a false impression of endorsement, and we have every right to dissociate with this insinuation. Besides, the two of us are clearly the “authors” of the signed letter that introduces each book. How can we be forced to introduce a textbook that we no longer recognise?” Yadav and Palshikar had served as chief advisors to NCERT for the political science books for classes 9 to 12 initially published in 2006-07.

Mushtaq lost her vision to pellet guns in the agitation post the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani.
The 22-year-old secured 319 marks out of 500 in the Jammu and Kashmir Board of School Education, the result for which were declared on Friday.
A resident of the Sedow area of Shopian in south Kashmir, Insha had cleared the Class 10 examination two years after losing her vision.
While everything around her seemed dark, she never lost hope. Her indomitable spirit and unwavering support system led her to achieve success, defying all odds.

“After Class 10, I joined Delhi Public School, Srinagar and took a three-year course in computers and English speaking. I qualified Class 11 in 2021 and have now qualified class 12,” Insha told PTI.
“My family was adamant that I study. They told me not to lose hope and courage, study and become independent,” she said.

Insha, who had become the face of pellet victims to lose their vision, also expressed gratitude to Jammu and Kashmir Centre For Peace And Justice (JKCPJ) – a non-governmental organisation (NGO) for their support.
“JKCPJ director Nadir Ali supported me. They rehabilitated me from 2018, providing me education,” she added.
Now Insha wants to pursue her bachelor’s degree and take coaching classes for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam.
“I want to become an IAS officer so that I can become an example for all the visually impaired persons. I want each one of them to become independent and move ahead in life,” she said.

Insha was hit by pellets on July 11, 2016, three days after Wani – the commander of a militant outfit – was killed in an encounter with the security forces. She was at her home and had opened a window to look outside when the tragedy struck.

NCERT refuses to remove names of ex-advisers; they stress ‘moral right’,"Reacting to objections from Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav, who criticized the recent rationalisation exercise and said they were embarrassed to be associated with the textbooks in their present form, the NCERT asserted that it owns the copyright to all educational material and that the ""withdrawal of association by any one member is out of the question,"" given that the textbooks are the product of a collective effort.","Reacting to objections from two former chief advisers who wanted their names removed from political science textbooks due to “irrational cuts and large deletions,” the NCERT has emphasised its right to make changes based on copyright ownership and stated that the “withdrawal of association by any one member is out of the question”, given that the textbooks are the product of a collective effort.
Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav, who were chief advisers for political science books for classes 9 to 12 initially published in 2006-07, on Saturday expressed disappointment with the development and, in a statement, said that if NCERT has legal authority to “distort and mutilate” educational material, they should also be able to exercise their “moral and legal right” to disassociate themselves from books they do not endorse.

Changing Trends in Civil Services Exams: How to Crack the UPSC Code!,"UPSC Exam is the test of your knowledge and determination. So, persevere in your efforts and study with a solid strategy in place.","Earlier this year in March, the news of ChatGPT failing the UPSC Prelims 2022 made rounds on the internet. People were amused but not surprised to know that even ChatGPT could not crack the IAS Exam; it is one of the toughest examinations in the world with more than 10 Lakh applicants on an average, and the success rate is only 1%.
Ensuring Difficulty Through Unpredictability
Year by year, UPSC sustains the difficulty level of the Civil Services Exams by altering question types, patterns, themes, subtopics, ratio of questions from different sections, and other aspects of Prelim & Main papers that no coaching or teacher can certainly predict. One may say that this unpredictability is a clever strategy adopted by UPSC to stay one step ahead of the candidates and coaching institutes.
For instance, in the Main Examination 2022, the essay paper surprised the candidates by introducing philosophical prompts in the entire paper. The tilt towards philosophical essays has put many aspirants in trouble as these kinds of questions need to be answered through a different approach than the essays based on current affairs.
New Trends in Prelim 2023
This year’s CSE Prelim paper substantially deviated from the past year trends and patterns. Nobody had expected that there would be 18 questions of Assertion and Reason (AR) type. “In 2022, no AR question was asked in the paper and there were less than five of them in the preceding years. These kinds of questions are quite time-consuming, and they used to be important about 10-15 years ago. UPSC seems to have brought back this trend now. It implies that there is a need to understand the subjective interpretation of topics,” says Satya Prakash (HOD, UPSC, Disha Publication).
According to the analysis done by Disha Experts, the UPSC has increased its focus on Geography, International Relations, and Polity. There were more map-based questions in the exam than ever. There is a shift from direct questions towards concept-based questions. There is also an increase in current as well as applied based questions. However, the most notable feature of Prelims 2023 is that about 46 questions have a “Unique Option Pattern” like Only One, Only Two, All Three, And None. As a result, it is impossible to use Elimination Techniques in these questions which were frequently applied by candidates earlier.
In the GS Paper 2 (CSAT), Quantitative Aptitude questions were found to be of moderate difficulty. However, the Reading Comprehension part was lengthy.
How to Deal with Changing CSE Trends?
If unpredictability is the rule of UPSC, deep conceptual understanding combined with practice is the key to gaining confidence and overcoming surprises in the exam.Core subject knowledge and an analytical bent of mind will help you score where techniques like elimination and guessing won’t work. You gain in-depth knowledge of a topic when you look at it from multiple perspectives. Such a vantage point can only be offered by previous year questions of all past years that you can attempt after finishing each topic, such as Disha’s 29 Years Civil Services IAS Prelims Topic-wise Solved Papers 1 & 2 by Mrunal Patel.

Another obvious but often ignored advice is that one should not leave an entire subject/topic to focus on others as many of the questions are actually amalgamation of one or more topics. This, in turn, means that you need a strong conceptual understanding, especially to deal with Unique Option type questions where elimination trick is impossible to use.
A mastery of NCERT concepts will also help, not only to build a strong foundation for advanced concepts but to make connections for Mains answer writing too.Study from resources that provide complete, integrated coverage of old and new NCERT concepts while presenting content in one-liner format to save your precious time. For instance, Disha’s NCERT Digest series will really get you sorted.
Furthermore, Disha’s unique TextGuides series have been designed to build strong conceptual base of aspirants along with providing ample practice. TextGuides are the only books in the market that come equipped with ‘Expert’s Advice’ – a unique feature that tells you what to study, which topics are important and how to frame answers. These exam oriented TextGuides can be trusted to qualify Mains papers in a single attempt!
In view of the latest exam trends, your grasp on Geography and Maps will substantially impact your overall score. You need more than just an Atlas to prepare this important section. Disha has recently introduced ‘Master Geography Through Maps’ with PYQs and Expert’s Advice which can definitely help you in this direction.

‘Embarrassed to be associated with these textbooks’: Advisors ask NCERT to drop their names from Pol Science books,"Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav, who were chief advisors for the political science books for classes 9 to 12 originally published in 2006-07, have in their letter to the NCERT have said that the rationalisation exercise has mutilated the school textbooks and rendered them academically dysfunctional.","Objecting to the recent “innumerable and irrational cuts and large deletions” made by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in school textbooks, Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav, who were chief advisors for the political science books for classes 9 to 12 originally published in 2006-07, have written to the Council disassociating themselves from the textbooks in their current form and requested that their names be dropped from them.
The NCERT school textbooks are at the centre of yet another controversy with academicians and politicians criticising the sweeping changes and deletions decided last year (and implemented this year) on the pretext of reducing curriculum to help students recover from learning disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. These changes include removing all references to the 2002 Gujarat riots, reducing content related to the Mughal era and the caste system, and dropping chapters on protests and social movements.

"How AI is generating new kinds of jobs, explains IIT Ropar professor","""We are living in exciting times. In the next few years, we will see new job descriptions and opportunities coming up,"" writes Dhall","— Abhinav Dhall
(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
A paradigm shift around the corner is typically met with both excitement and unease. We are witnessing one such shift in the world of computing, with the progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI)  in the form of Large Language Models (LLM).
With access to vast amounts of data and massive computing facilities, newly-generated LLMs such as ChatGPT have shown potential in assisting users with few tasks. For obvious reasons, this has raised concerns across sections of the society, a common refrain being job cuts.

The popular adage that the only thing persistent is change holds true here. The current possibilities of AI are going to generate opportunities and the workforce across different industries need not feel alarmed by it. We need to embrace AI  and upskill in order to learn the ways the new AI enabled-tools can enhance creativity, productivity and safety.
The adoption of these AI-enabled tools will automatically open up opportunities for AI skill-trainers. This AI skillset training is not just for software engineers but for other professions too such as human resources, office assistants, accountants, doctors and lawyers.

We are already witnessing a demand in AI up-skilling courses in the form of certifications and workshops being conducted by both academia and industry.

Moving forward, there will be demand for experts in the AI domain. These professionals will be advising small and large organisations regarding the areas in which they can deploy AI-enabled tools.
As a developing country, we have seen the adoption of digital technology in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). A popular example is MSME businesses using accounting software platforms such as Tally for accounts and inventory digitisation.
This has created jobs for Tally professionals who specialise in company specific customisation, deployment and supporting of the software platform. Drawing from this analogy, we will witness AI and AI enabled tools implementation and deployment professionals.

High quality audio-visual content generation has been limited to studios with sophisticated equipment. With the availability of AI-enabled content generation and editing apps, content creators in Tier 2 and 3 cities across the country can generate high quality content. It is now possible to generate content in multiple languages. Moving forward, content creators with access to AI enabled tools will be able to create high quality content fast and this will generate more jobs.
AI-enabled tools are deployed on a cloud platform or on a device. Currently, learning the LLMs requires massive amounts of energy. Demand in AI scientists and AI Ops engineers will increase for continuous progress in more accurate, energy efficient, fair and explainable AI systems.
The same will also see a push in higher education for training of graduate researchers in AI systems. As ChatGPT was launched, a new job title — “prompt engineer” — was posted on job portals. These professionals are experts in interacting with LLM systems to extract the most relevant information. This is just an example of a new category of jobs, which has been created in the past six months.
Remote medicine and diagnostics will see a major boost with AI-enabled tools. This may lead to jobs generated for professionals who can assist clinical experts. On similar lines, experts who can validate reports generated by AI-enabled imaging tools will be required. Drug discovery already is getting a massive push due to AI.

There are concerns too. For one, there is an immediate need for AI ethics, law and policy professionals. There are important questions about the ownership of the data used for training AI systems and the ownership of the AI systems trained on
data created by third parties. Furthermore, there are concerns about fairness – How well an AI- enabled tool work when presented with data of person(s)/situation(s) of a particular culture, gender which are relatively hard to collect during the training process is an important question to think about.

Scoring 6 IELTS bands in individual sections not compulsory for Canada’s SDS,"The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has made the changes to the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) requirement which will be effective from August 10.","IELTS test takers applying through the Student Direct Stream category for Canadian study permits will not be required to achieve a minimum score of 6.0 bands in all individual sections of the test from August, according to IDP Education, the co-owner of IELTS.
The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has made the changes to the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) requirement which will be effective from August 10.
“In light of the recent changes made by the IRCC, we are delighted by the decision that IELTS Academic test takers applying through the SDS programme will now require only an overall 6 band score. There is no longer any requirement to achieve a minimum score of 6 bands in each section,” said Piyush Kumar, Regional Director, South Asia and Mauritius, IDP Education.

“This update represents a positive shift towards recognising the comprehensive abilities of test takers rather than focusing solely on individual band scores. We believe this change will provide greater opportunities for talented students worldwide to pursue their educational goals in Canada and also reflects authorities’ confidence in IELTS,” he said.
IELTS is one of the most popular English language proficiency tests for study, migration or work. Over three million people take the test every year and is accepted by more than 11,000 employers, universities, schools and immigration bodies around the world.
The Student Direct Stream (SDS) is an expedited study permit processing programme for those applying to study in Canada at a post-secondary designated learning institution.
The SDS programme has consistently served as a streamlined and expedited pathway for eligible students to study in Canada. It offers faster visa processing time and a smoother transition for students to Canadian educational institutions.

“Now test takers would find it even more attractive for the SDS programme. IELTS has the biggest network of test centres. It provides the option of paper-based tests in more than 150 venues across over 80 cities in India and computer-delivered tests in 46 centres, making it very convenient for the candidates. We also plan to introduce IELTS One Skill Retake (OSR) in India soon to ensure the candidates have the flexibility to retake any one section of the test,” Kumar said.
“We encourage students interested in pursuing their education in Canada to take advantage of the new English test requirements under the SDS programme. The removal of the minimum score requirement in all individual bands of the IELTS Academic test presents a more inclusive and holistic approach to evaluating students’ language proficiency, supporting a wider range of talented individuals in their pursuit of higher education,” he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/study-abroad-scoring-minimum-6-ielts-bands-in-individual-sections-not-mandatory-for-canada-study-visa-8653714/,education

Karnataka: Full revision of school textbooks not on cards for now,An educationist says reversing the changes made to Kannada textbooks during BJP rule is easier than undoing the revisions in history textbooks.,"The Karnataka government is unlikely to go for a full revision of textbooks, with sources in the school education department saying only the controversial chapters introduced by the BJP government will be dropped for the current academic year.
In a meeting with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday, former textbook revision committee head Baraguru Ramachandrappa suggested that a full revision of textbooks, especially of the Kannada and social science subjects, was not a “practical and viable” option for now.
Ramachandrappa further suggested that only the controversial lessons be replaced with new ones. It was also suggested that a circular detailing clarifications and chapter replacements be distributed among schools for the current academic year.

Some educationists say the chapter on RSS founder K B Hedgewar and works of right-wing ideologues like Chakravarthy Sulibele, Bannanje Govindacharya and others can be dropped.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Ramachandrappa said, “I have suggested the government remove controversial chapters and not go for a full textbook revision at this point. Revising the full textbook is not viable and practical. It is a time-consuming process. Instead, the government can identify the controversial lessons and drop them from the academic year. Such lessons should not be considered for examination purposes.”
Ramachandrappa also suggested that the government can refer to the revisions done by previous textbook revision committees. “The government need not form any separate committee. They can replace the controversial chapters with chapters included by previous textbook revision committee heads. The dropped and replaced chapters can be specified in a circular and distributed across the schools. The teachers will thus know what to teach and what to drop,” he added.
There were speculations that Ramachandrappa would be appointed to head the textbook revision committee again. However, he said, “I was only consulted by the government on how to go about revising the textbooks. I have shared my views with the chief minister and he seemed to concur with my suggestions. Moreover, I don’t have any interest in taking up the role as the textbook revision committee head. Let other people also get a chance to take the responsibility.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Educationist Niranjanaradhya V P, who is working on giving recommendations to drop some of the controversial lessons, said, “It is slightly easy to review and drop lessons in Kannada because only chapters have been changed. However, with history, the previous government has changed sentences and words, which are difficult to identify and undo. We have to compare previous years’ textbooks with current textbooks to identify the changes.”
The academic year has already begun and students in government schools are being taught bridge courses. Textbook teaching is expected to start only after June 15, once the bridge courses are completed.
Textbook revision is one of the many poll promises made by the Congress during its election campaign. The matter has been in the news since the BJP government appointed right-wing ideologue Rohith Chakrathirtha as chairman of the textbook revision committee. Chakrathirtha, who was earlier booked on charge of insulting the state anthem, was accused of “saffronising” textbooks by including works of right-wing ideologues and dropping the works of noted writers such as P Lankesh and Sara Aboobacker.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/full-revision-of-school-textbooks-not-on-cards-for-now-in-karnataka-8651074/,education

Schools also have the liberty to use their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for meeting their share of the redevelopment cost. Money can also be arranged from MP’s and MLA’s funds for the ambitious project, he said.
A similar scheme was in last year as well, under which the government and the school management committee had to bear 50 per cent each of the renovation cost, the minister said.
However, as the old scheme saw lower participation from schools, amendments were made to increase the government’s share to 75 per cent, he added.
Under the latest redevelopment scheme, which is also applicable to private schools, the government will begin with schools that are over 50 years old, followed by schools that are 40 years and 30 years old, the government said in a statement.
Special attention will be paid to the construction of floors, roofs and separate toilets for girls, among other renovation works, the statement added.

It said a proposal has been submitted to the Union Ministry of Education for the construction of physical infrastructure for the Faculty of Technology which will take time on receipt of necessary financial and other statutory approvals.
The committee recommended that adequate arrangements for space be made for classrooms and laboratories for the BTech programmes till the exclusive building for the Faculty of Technology is built and made operational.

“The committee authorised the vice-chancellor to decide upon the space and other essential physical infrastructure for initiation of these B.Tech programmes,” the report read.
As far as student strength in the first year is concerned, the committee noted that each course will have 120 students. It means a total of 360 students will be admitted.

NCERT on rationalisation of textbooks: ‘Need-based exercise aimed at reducing content load’,"""The rationalised textbooks are part of this transitional phase, i.e., this academic year 2023-24 only, as NCERT is engaged in the process of finalising the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) based on NEP 2020,"" read NCERT statement.","The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has issued a statement regarding the ‘rationalisation of textbooks’ calling it a need-based exercise aimed at reducing the content load. The NCERT asserted that a new set of books will be used from next academic year and these books are not for a long time.
“The rationalised textbooks are part of this transitional phase, i.e., this academic year 2023-24 only, as NCERT is engaged in the process of finalising the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) based on NEP 2020. This will be followed by a new set of textbooks which will be used from next academic year. So, this should be very clear that these books are not for a long time,” read the statement.

Recently, it came to light that NCERT has removed the chapter on periodic table from Class 10 Science textbooks as a part of the rationalisation exercise. The rationalisation exercise which was carried out in June 2022 also deleted passages on ‘evolution.’

Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan released the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, which will replace the 2019 guidelines.
According to Pradhan, the new rules are built on the principle of a “light but tight” regulatory framework envisioned in the National Education Policy 2020.
“The new simplified guidelines will encourage universities to focus on quality and excellence, strengthen the research ecosystem and have a long-term impact in transforming our higher education landscape. The norms will facilitate creation of many more quality-focused deemed to be universities in an objective and transparent manner,” Pradhan said.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) Act provides for the central government to declare any institution other than a university the status of institution deemed to be university. The first set of regulations in this regard was notified in 2010 and these were subsequently revised in 2016 and 2019.
Under the 2019 guidelines, the higher education institutions having “existence for not less than 20 years” were eligible for applying for the status. However, the revised guidelines have now replaced it with multi-disciplinarity, NAAC grading, NIRF ranking and NBA grading.
ADVERTISEMENT
It means any multi-disciplinary institution having valid accreditation by NAAC with at least 3.01 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for three consecutive cycles, NBA accreditation for two-thirds of eligible programmes for three consecutive cycles or in the top 50 of any specific category of NIRF for the last three years continuously will be able to apply for the deemed status, the guidelines stated.

Besides, a cluster of institutions managed by more than one sponsoring body or a society can also apply for deemed to be university status, it added.
The new regulations also introduces the “Distinct Institution” category, where an existing institution or an institution starting from the beginning with the focus on teaching and research in unique disciplines and/or addressing the strategic needs of the country or engaged in the preservation of Indian cultural heritage or preservation of the environment or dedicated to skill development or dedicated to sports or languages or any other discipline, so determined by the Expert Committee of Commission, will be exempted from eligibility criteria.
UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said that the 2023 guidelines are in tune with NEP 2020 and they are light but tight.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We hope these regulations will encourage many more high-quality higher education institutions to be established in our country in emerging areas to meet the aspirations of our students. Since ‘deemed to be universities’ wording is part of the UGC Act, 1956, we cannot remove this term at this time. However, it will be removed once the Higher Education Commission of India is established through an act of Parliament,” he said.
There are around 170 deemed institutions in the country currently.
Among other criteria that have been changed are the faculty strength has been increased from 100 to 150, corpus fund for private institutions has been increased from Rs 10 crore to Rs 25 crore, and creation of an executive councils like central universities in these universities as well.
The revised guidelines have also made it mandatory for deemed universities to register on Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). “The institutions can offer twinning programmes, joint degree programmes, and dual degree programmes in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the regulations concerned,” the guidelines stated.
Besides, deemed universities with minimum ‘A’ grade and above or ranked from 1 to 100 in the “universities” category of NIRF rankings of the relevant year are eligible to set up off-campus centres.

"How Pritha Dasgupta, first recipient of Tricia Cohen Scholarship is adjusting to life at University of Dundee","Currently pursuing her PhD from the University of Dundee in a small Scotland town, Pritha Dasgupta shares how she has been adjusting to her new life, managing work and living abroad.","(This letter is part of a series by The Indian Express where we bring to you the experiences of students at different foreign universities. From scholarships and loans to food and cultural experiences — students tell us how life is different in those countries and things they are learning other than academics)
I decided that I wanted to do a PhD while I was pursuing graduation from St Xavier’s College, Kolkata. I completed my graduation in Microbiology and went on to study Biotechnology for master’s. I completed my master’s from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. It was during this time that I decided to move abroad for my PhD. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Biotechnology at the School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland.
One of the reasons for moving abroad was that there was great progress in my field of research in other countries and there is so much to learn and grow. A lot of people prefer working after pursuing a certain level of education, but my goal was always research. I would be the second person in my family to get a PhD, my paternal uncle being the first. He has always been my inspiration. I plan to pursue post-doctorate.
Why I couldn’t apply right after master’s
However, I couldn’t apply to a lot of places after completing my post-graduation as my master’s thesis was quite short due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is generally for one year, but due to Covid we were home for six months and the thesis period was then only four months. And, since I did not have much experience in the lab due to it, I decided not to apply that year.
In order to apply to places of my choice and gain more experience, I worked as a CSIR Junior Research Fellow at the National Centre for Biological Science in Bengaluru for nearly a year. And, then I applied to colleges abroad.
University of Dundee and Tricia Cohen Prize
I wanted to pursue my PhD in Europe so I applied to a lot of Max Planck programmes. Along with that, I applied here in Dundee, as it (the university) specialises in the field I was researching on while in Bengaluru.
I started my preparation in October and got my confirmation in January. I started my course in September 2022. I am also the first recipient of the Tricia Cohen Prize Studentship. I was awarded the scholarship from among hundreds of applicants. Tricia Cohen was the wife of Professor Sir Philip Cohen, one of the UK’s most distinguished biochemists. She passed away in 2020.
Documents needed for admission
ADVERTISEMENT
The university asks for an English language test and I already had my TOEFL score, which I am not sure if it is mandatory, and if you’re doing a doctorate study in UK, you need to get an APS certificate. The university sends all the required documents for APS and you have to send them back. Apart from that, you need your CV, marksheets, certificates and all.
This was my first time outside India and I did not know anyone in the UK, but I didn’t have to worry about it so much as the fellowship I am a part of took care of everything. They picked me up from Glasgow Airport to the hotel and everything was booked. In fact, Sir Philip Cohen personally oversaw the preparations. However, I was a bit anxious as I didn’t know anybody.
My life at Dundee
At Dundee, I stay in an apartment with another PhD student, I have my room and we share a kitchen, common area and washroom. PhD students for some reason do not get university accommodation. I generally don’t get the time to cook, but I ensure that I cook one meal a day, the other meal I generally eat out.
I booked the accommodation from India and then when arrived, I reported to the authorities and they helped me with the process. It is only after I came here that I realised how helpful people in Scotland are. It has been a great experience
Homesickness and what I do about it
ADVERTISEMENT
I did not take a loan as the grant I receive from PhD and the fellowship is enough for me to sustain myself. I haven’t been home since I came from India in September 2022, I miss it. There is nothing you can do when you feel homesick, so I try to engage myself in work as much as I can. I especially miss home during festivals. Hopefully I will go home this year.
Now, since I have spent a considerable amount of time here, I have made friends with both Indians and non-Indians. Not all my friends are of my age and generation. I have friends with people from different age groups with whom I share the same interests and we have great discussions.
Dundee is a small town and my place is pretty close to the city centre and university. Everything from supermarkets to all amenities are close by. We have Indian shops where we get all Indian groceries but they are a little expensive. I mostly cook Indian food but I don’t have to buy a lot of Indian groceries as I have a lot of spices from home. Being a Bengali, mustard oil is a must in our food, but since you are not allowed to carry a large amount of liquid, I got my mustard oil from here and I cook all my meals in it.
One thing I realised is that in order to travel in Scotland you need to have a car, though I don’t have one. I have been to several places including Edinburgh, Perth, Glasgow, St Andrews, and also did an island trip from Edinburgh.
Advice for students willing to pursue PhD abroad
ADVERTISEMENT
Students applying abroad should do their research well and understand that the places they are applying to have the necessary expertise. The second thing they need to consider is the city and if they are getting a fellowship or not and how much fellowship they are getting and how much they can save. Also, one thing I feel is important to consider is whether that place has an international community.

The exam is being held for the second time for student of the strife-torn Manipur
A vacation bench of Justices Manish Pitale and Neela Gokhale heard a plea filed by Dhanashree Jagatap seeking permission to reappear for the exam.

According to Jagatap, she arrived at the NEET-UG examination centre on May 7 but fell on the ground due to rush in the queue, resulting in dislocation of her right wrist joint.
She was taken to a nearby hospital and was later brought back to the centre where she was allotted a writer, Jagatap said in the plea.
However, while the time period for the exam was three hours and 20 minutes, she started the exam late but was not given extra time to finish her paper, due to which she could not attempt the last part pertaining to Physics subject, Jagatap’s plea said.
Seeking a direction to the National Testing Agency to permit her to reappear, Jagatap, in her plea, said although the NEET-UG examination is conducted only once every year, this year due to sudden outbreak of violence in Manipur, NEET-UG 2023 examination is being held separately for students of that state.

When the plea came up for hearing on Thursday, the Union government said it was willing to permit Jagatap to reappear for the exam on June 6 but on the condition that she shall not rely on the marks obtained by her in the May 7 examination.
Accepting this, the court said Jagatap shall be permitted to appear for NEET-UG 2023 examination along with the students from Manipur at a centre in Bengaluru, adding that concerned authorities shall take appropriate steps to facilitate her in appearing for the said examination.

What to expect from campus life at IIT? Former director of IIT Kanpur explains,"Life in a typical engineering UG program is extremely fast, demanding, competitive, and strenuous. This pressure brings the best out of an individual. In fact, the smart and focused ones never complain about load or difficulty.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
Indranil Manna
Engineering is one of the most popular disciplines among the youth in India. Largely, this inclination arises out of the attractive career prospects the field brings. The numbers attest to its popularity: nearly 10 lakh students took the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) to get admission in the top engineering institutions, which is about 60% of the students who appeared in CBSE Class 12 or Higher Secondary examination this year.
JEE Advanced 2023 Live Updates | Check analysis, result date, guidelines
Only 25% of these students cross over to the next, and more difficult hurdle of JEE Advanced. It is well-known that the JEE (Main and Advanced) exams are one of the toughest undergraduate admission tests.
While one has reasons to feel elated after securing admission to a BTech program in an IIT, it is not uncommon to see some students turning unhappy and frustrated very soon. This can happen for not getting a seat in computer science, grades plummeting at some point, or later, for not getting a job offer with the same CTC (pay package) as what another would have been offered.
But to avoid this, it is important for every student and concerned parent to shun any illusion, harbour no unrealistic expectation, and be clear about one’s inclination, aptitude, and future dream – what is that one aspires to be, what will please one the most, what is worth and what is not?

Can the CTC alone provide the ultimate satisfaction? Do we know enough about what it is like to successfully complete a 4-year BTech program in an IIT?
Life in a typical engineering UG program is extremely fast, demanding, competitive, and strenuous. This pressure brings the best out of an individual. In fact, the smart and focused ones never complain about load or difficulty.

The subject, teacher, context, delivery, style, and level of complexity may change every hour with every new lecture, tutorial or sessional.
Before one realises it, class tests, surprise quizzes, seminar presentations, assignment submissions and semester examinations start appearing at regular intervals.
Everyone who enters IIT is an extremely talented individual with practically equal measures of intellectual capability. It is very important that one performs well and constantly improves and improvises every day.
As everyone around is equally sharp and keen, any serious distraction or lack of attention or focus is bound to adversely affect grades and progress, which in turn, may badly hamper future career prospects including employment or higher studies. Thus, one cannot afford to be inattentive and faulter, lest one ruins the highly coveted opportunity that one has earned for oneself by qualifying through JEE.

But life in an IIT is not all work and no play. Every department has a student society on top of dozens of student activity clubs and contests, multiple annual festivals, hackathons, sports meets, and periodic seminars.
Most importantly, the hostel life with friends from all over the country with diverse linguistic, cultural, and socio-economic background makes life truly exciting, enjoyable, and educative.
In fact, one learns from friends more than from a lecturer or textbooks. The huge pool of successful and iconic IIT alumni spread all over the globe in academia, research organisations, government, and industry is another great source of inspiration, encouragement, ideas, and career growth. It always helps to cultivate relations with them.

IITs are famous not merely as teaching institutions but also for their contribution to research in the engineering domain. While at an IIT, it will benefit you if you indulge in some level of research activity either through a term paper, short project, or a UG/PG thesis. Since knowledge is ever expanding and advancing, it will also be a good idea for each young professional to either acquire a higher degree immediately after graduation or later after taking a break from the service.

Many IITs routinely pursue very attractive international collaborations covering student and scholar exchange, summer internships, joint degree programs, and visit opportunities. To avail all such provisions and opportunities, it is important that every student acquires proper skills of articulation, comprehension, and communication. These soft skills actually provide you an edge over another in an interview or group discussion.
All IITs have student activity groups promoting debate, extempore speech, reporting, web designing, programming, among others. Such possibilities are plenty, but time and scope are limited. No matter how hard one tries, the day will not stretch even by a minute from the usual length of 24 hours. Thus, it is absolutely important that students in an IIT also learn to prioritise and select the essentials. Engineering offers multiple solutions, nonunique, every other day brings a new challenge and opportunity, it is up to us how well we embrace them to our advantage.

"Students furious about ‘normalisation’ process after CUET UG 2023 result, say ‘is this a luck-based exam?’","As universities begin the admission process, students complain about the normalisation process, and demand for 'more fair analysis'.","The results of the Common University Entrance Test, Undergraduate (CUET UG) 2023 — announced on Saturday (July 15) — have left candidates disappointed as their scores came out to be lower than expected. Several students took to social media to complain about the ‘normalisation process’.
Rishita Singh, an 18-year-old from Varanasi, who is aiming to pursue BA (Hons) from Delhi University, claims that her CUET score decreased by 70 points due to the normalisation process. “The score that I calculated on the basis of the final answer key was way more. My raw score was 776 (out of 800) which has been reduced to 705 and this leaves me with little chance of getting into the desired colleges of Delhi University,” she told indianexpress.com.
The UGC chief, M Jagadesh Kumar, has defended the normalisation process by stating that it is important in order to offer a “level playing field” for all students.

“First, we must remember that in a given discipline, we were required to conduct CUET in multiple shifts in a subject due to the large number of students participating in the test. For example, if the exam is in economics, NTA experts prepare multiple economics papers for use in different shifts. Despite our best efforts, the difficulty level of each paper will slightly differ from the other. Therefore, one needs to use normalised scores instead of obtained scores by a student.
“For this purpose, we use a scientific method called the equi-percentile method for normalising the difficulty level across different shifts. In the process, the normalised scores for some students will be less than the obtained score; for others, it may increase,” he told indianexpress.com.
However, students are alleging that the National Testing Agency (NTA) has converted the CUET UG exam from a talent and intelligence based exam to ‘luck-based test’.
“I know several others like me who appeared for the CUET UG exam, and while some of us had difficult exams, there were others who appeared for shifts with moderate difficulty levels. But how is that our fault? My marks have been reduced by 40-50 points and that can cost me a seat at my desired institute in Delhi University. It is purely about who is lucky enough to get the rare chance to have his/her score increased, but others like me have suffered,” said Ashwina Asthana, who is aiming to pursue BA (Hons) Economics from Delhi University.
ADVERTISEMENT
Agreeing with Asthana, Singh added that the process feels ‘unfair’ to her. “It is utterly unfair, and a luck-based performance in the name of providing a level playing field. None of the people I know have benefitted from normalsation. People who score 50 points less than me are 5 points ahead of me, after this unfair process.”
Kumar, however, rubbishes these allegations and claims that “this method has been in vogue for decades globally and is a statistical procedure for establishing correspondence between scores on different tests. Therefore, there is no luck or unfairness. Students need not worry about it.”
Some students have also advised NTA to watch out for the margin with which the normalised score was calculated. ”
“In the General Test, my score decreased from 151 to 129, in Maths it decreased from 134 to 109. I agree with NTA about the normalisation process and I understand that it is needed for fairness, but the margin of normalisation is huge. So, NTA should find a solution for it and ensure that the students who are scoring well on the basis of their preparation and merit are not adversely affected,” Suhavni Pulani, a 17-year-old from Delhi, said.

"For initiative combating pandemic-induced learning disruption, MCD school on T4’s education’s shortlist for ‘world’s best school for community collaboration’",The programme was designed to equip family members to help and guide students; 64 dropouts enrolled back.,"— Ishita Roy
The Nagar Nigam Pratibha Baalika Vidyalaya in North East Delhi’s Dilshad Colony, run by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), has made it to UK-based T4 Education’s top 10 shortlist on the “World’s Best Schools in Community Collaboration”.
The news was announced by the organisation, which puts out a list every year on “schools that have made a difference”, in June.
The school, which was established in 1965, started a community engagement programme in April 2020, one month into the national lockdown imposed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Called the Family Champion Programme, the initiative aimed at ensuring that students stayed connected with the school, even as physical and in-person education took a hit during the pandemic.

The school worked with an NGO named Kshamtalaya Foundation for the same, which reached out to the students and their families through a door-to-door campaign. The aim: equipping family members to help and guide their children with classes by briefing them about the challenges of virtual education.
“We all know that kids from economically backward communities come to the MCD schools. So, it was our responsibility to give them quality education at all times. They should also know everything, education should reach everyone,” said Principal Sita Verma.
Verma said the school also started 25 community libraries and a dry ration distribution programme.

“The libraries were set up in very cramped and small spaces, where our volunteers would carry out educational activities. Despite the challenges, we made sure that they kept running. Some of these spaces were part of homes of volunteers and former students,” said Verma.
Due to the school’s continuous efforts in “community-based interventions”, 65 dropouts were enrolled in the school across its morning and evening schedules.
“We were determined to enrol students who dropped out of schools during Covid-19,” said Jyoti Yadav, Community Lead, Kshamtalaya Foundation.
“We never thought that our efforts would win us international recognition. We did this for our kids. I was a teacher before I became a principal. For me, it was always about making education accessible,” said Verma.
ADVERTISEMENT
She said that only 16 family members, who the programme called Family Champions, completed the training offered through the initiative in 2020. However, the number rose up of 20 and 25 in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Asked about the plans ahead, Verma said the school was looking at expanding the initiative further.
“We have seen many women who want to be part of the programme. They are doing this for the children but also for themselves. Our programme also helped these women, who have been in the household for so long, to get back their confidence. They not only taught but also trained other family champions,” said Verma.
Sangam Kumari, one of the mothers engaged in the programme, told The Indian Express, “Learning the art of teaching has changed my life. I am more confident now. Earlier, I did not dare to speak against my husband, but now I can also stand up for myself.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“We started this programme keeping in mind the guidelines of the NEP (National Education Policy), 2020. The goals of our programme are community education and women’s participation,” said Aggarwal.
“T4 Education is a UK-based organisation, very reputed in education. We got to know that they award schools for their efforts in making a difference in the education sector. When we were starting our programme, we realised that no other school has done anything like this. This motivated us to keep doing what we did,” added Aggarwal.
T4 Education told The Indian Express that 10 schools were selected out of the applications received from 108 countries.
The top three finalists will be declared by September, while the winner will be announced in October, informed T4 Education. The winner will receive a cash Prize of $50,000.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/for-initiative-combating-pandemic-induced-learning-disruption-mcd-school-on-t4s-educations-shortlist-for-worlds-best-school-for-community-collaboration-8844102/,education

Know the Common Ingredients in Every 2022 UPSC Topper’s Preparation Strategy,"The UPSC CSE is known to be one of the most challenging competitive exams in the world. Among the thousands of candidates, only a handful manage to achieve success.","The UPSC CSE is known to be one of the most challenging competitive exams in the world. Among the thousands of candidates, only a handful manage to achieve success.
This article is based on the insights drawn from the in-depth interviews conducted by Disha Publication of various UPSC top rankers. It explores the key ingredients that have contributed to the success of UPSC Civil Services2022 Toppers like Garima Lohia (AIR 2), Smriti Mishra (AIR 4), Dr Mayur Hazarika (AIR 5), Waseem Ahmad Bhat (AIR 7), Aniruddh Yadav (AIR 8), Swati Sharma (AIR 15), Sunil Phogat (AIR 77) and others. While their individual journeys may vary, there are certain common strategies that all these toppers adopted to score high in the Prelims and Mains.
Aspiring candidates can draw inspiration from these common success ingredients and tailor their preparation strategies accordingly.
Solve Topic-wise Previous Year Questions (PYQs):
Every topper swears by the importance of PYQs that cannot be stressed enough. For instance, Waseem Ahmad Bhat (AIR 7) recalls that he made it a part of his study routine to finish PYQs immediately after studying each topic. In this regard, Waseem says that Disha’s Topic-wise Previous Years Solved Papers helped him a great deal in understanding the UPSC exam pattern and keeping a track of his progress. Similarly, Garima Lohia (AIR 2) says that she did not skip a single PYQ given in Disha’s IAS Mains Year wise Solved Papers series of 4 books.
In-depth Study and Clearing Concepts:
All toppers reiterate that superficial study materials are no good to crack the UPSC CSE exam. The removal of elimination technique by UPSC and the increase in ‘Unique Option Pattern’ questions in Prelims further prove the significance of in-depth study. Toppers delve deep into each subject, thoroughly understanding the fundamental principles and their practical applications. For instance, Mayur Hazarika (AIR 5) says: “I aimed to develop a holistic understanding of the topics by studying from a comprehensive resource like Disha’s International Relations by Deepanshu Singh. The well-rounded coverage of topics presented in this book enabled me to tackle complex questions while making relevant connections.”
Mastering Maps:
Those who recognize the significance of maps and make it a priority to develop a strong grasp on them definitely score better than others. Garima Lohia explains: “By preparing maps properly, you not only answer the numerous map-based questions with precision, but also easily retain data/ facts and reproduce maps for Mains answer writing. Although exact replication is not necessary in maps, a reasonable level of accuracy is expected. “All toppers understand that maps are not only important in the written papers but also in the interview stage, where questions related to countries and regions are raised often.
While an Atlas can only give you a peripheral knowledge of maps, a unique book like Disha’s 4 colored Master Geography Through Maps with infographics, PYQs, charts and tables can give you a solid exam-oriented training for UPSC.

Learn Data from Authentic Sources:
Toppers make it a point to learn data and statistics from authentic sources only. For example: Disha’s Quarterly Current Affairs is one such resource that extracts data directly from government reports, factsheets, etc. “While slight variations are allowed, the numbers you provide should be close enough to the actual figures. It is important to use reliable data to support your arguments and provide a strong foundation for your answer or essay,” says Mayur Hazarika (AIR 5).
Note-making & Regular Revision
Revision and note-making are indispensable in UPSC preparation. “Make notes with only one thing in mind: you should be able to go over the whole gist of the topic with facts & data when you revise months later,” says Swati Sharma (AIR 15). Waseem Bhat (AIR 7) remarks: “Regular revision helps you consolidate your knowledge while staying updated with latest changes helps you gain an edge in the competition.”
Philosophical or Quote-based Essays:
According to UPSC toppers like Garima Lohia, Mayur Hazarika, Waseem A Bhat, Sunil Phogat and others, essays based on quotes or philosophical themes can be highly scoring if answered with creativity, unique perspectives, and factual knowledge. “You have to focus on connecting these themes with the areas of interest for UPSC, such as governance, law, foreign policy, politics, social equality, and the economy. By blending your understanding of these subjects with factual writing, you can present compelling essays that stand out,” says Garima. Check out Disha’s 51 Philosophical Essays if you want to gain a richer perspective on how to write quote-based essays.
In recent years, a growing number of toppers of various competitive exams have testified that they owe their success to various books published by Disha Publication. Recognizing the impact of Disha books on the success of toppers, Disha Publication has initiated a new campaign called “Toppers Read Disha Books.” The purpose of this campaign is to discover and showcase the stories of more toppers who have studied from Disha books to motivate the current exam aspirants and steer them in the right direction.

"A Lesson from IIT: Computer Science remains top choice, but research-oriented fields important, writes former IIT-Guwahati director","""There is a huge imbalance in terms of preferences. If about 2,000 students get admitted to the BTech in Computer Science at IITs, there are 150 students in an MSc for Earth Sciences""","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Gautam Biswas
IITs attract a fair bit of attention when JEE Advanced results are declared. Most IIT aspirants are good students who work hard and clear an intense and competitive exam.
However, many of them lack deep knowledge or understanding about the various disciplines the IITs have to offer. This can be attributed to the overarching influence of parents who try to push them towards a specific course that they think will ensure job security.
No surprises here: Computer Science and Engineering is the top preference. Mathematics and Computing come next in line. The course names are different in different institutes, but the link to “computing” essentially guides the choice.
IITs Go Global | IIT Delhi to set-up their first global campus in Abu Dhabi; courses to begin next year
The branches that appear next on the list are are usually Electrical/ Electronics (in some IITs, Electrical and Electronics are two different disciplines), followed by Mechanical Engineering. Other branches such as Chemical Engineering, Materials Engineering (earlier name was Metallurgy and Materials), Biological Science and Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Energy Engineering, Ocean Engineering/ Naval Architecture, Architecture, Design, Earth Sciences, Textile Engineering, Agricultural Engineering, are chosen based on the perceived reputation of these branches in a specific Institute.
Sometimes, students who end up in these branches feel like these are secondary fields, which have been allotted to them because they could not get Computer Science. But one thing is clear: There is a huge imbalance in terms of preferences. In the entire country, about 2000 post-secondary students get admitted in the Bachelor’s programme (BTech) in Computer science and engineering programs at IITs in contrast to an MSc in Earth Sciences, where the total number of students is around 150.

For the BTech programme in Mining engineering, the total number of students is less than 100. This raises some questions: How can we cope with the country’s need for exploration of minerals and noble metals?

Innovations improve several aspects of human life. A timely innovation can benefit the society in terms of material comforts, monetary affluence, better health care, safety, and security. Innovation requires out-of-the-box thinking, a favourable ecosystem, and a grip over relevant domain knowledge. We have to be innovative in order to meet the aspirations of the country.
Read | Why should undergraduate students care whether an institute is research-oriented or not? IIT Delhi professor explains
The Government of India has introduced a host of new programmes, including Digital India, Smart Cities, Unnat Bharat, Swachh Bharat, Make in India, Energy Security, Food Security, Skill Development, and E-mobility, among others. Through these, India is likely to see a profusion of emerging technologies. For the success of these programmes, we need trained and dedicated human resources in all branches of engineering and science.Take Biosciences and Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Sciences, for example.
Recently, nanotechnology is reported to have been deployed to deliver anti-cancer drugs impeccably to the primary tumour site. Taiwan has effectively driven the efforts this area – Taipei Medical University (TMU) and National Taiwan University (NTU) have developed an anti-cancer therapy drug that has been approved for trials by the USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration). The drug is set to inhibit histone deacetylase activity, effectively killing cancer cells, and causing fewer side effects.
Solar thermal devices and solar photovoltaic devices are ubiquitous solutions in the face of energy crises. A solar thermal device converts solar radiation into thermal energy that finds a myriad of applications. Solar drying systems can be put to effective use in industry and agriculture.

Nanoelectronics and its ubiquitous chip technology have already transformed many industries. We still categorise these devices as microelectronics, though the technology has gone beyond conventional microelectronics. The impact of electronic nanotechnology has been the key to microelectromechanical systems. Nanomechanical production technology is likewise based on arrays of nanoscale components that work together at high frequencies and handle small, discrete functions. The only difference is this: In nanomachines, things are not bits packaged in bytes, they are atoms packaged in molecules.
Advances in Organic Electronics or Flexible Electronics are definite game-changers. Flexible organic optoelectronic devices have promising implications for next-generation portable electronics. Microfluidics is another emerging area that deals with the control and manipulation of fluids, typically in the range of sub-millimetres. It is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of mechanical engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biotechnology, with practical implications for the design of advanced systems.
A Lesson from IIT | After JEE Advanced, how to choose between IITs and branches? Former IIT Guwahati director explains
These are some of the many possibilities of engineering research.
However, there is a problem: a lack of student engagement guided by perceptions that Computer Science is the prime field to take. Increasing student engagement is no mean task. It takes passion, commitment, and compassion to tap into the talents of each unique student.
ADVERTISEMENT
There are ways to initiate and immerse students more actively into the teaching-learning experience. By becoming active learners, one can hope that students will demonstrate a level of engagement not observed before.
We have to come up with ideas that keep students motivated and engaged. Eventually, we will progress towards a dynamic academia.

Highlighting the work done in the field of medical education and the healthcare sector, the chief minister said before 2017, there were only 12 medical colleges in the state. “After 2017, however, realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concept of ‘one district-one medical college’, medical colleges are being established in all districts of Uttar Pradesh. Today, government medical colleges are operational in 45 districts and under construction in other 16 districts,” the chief minister said.

The Chief Minister alleged that the previous governments neglected the paramedical and nursing institutions. The state medical faculty itself was ailing and there was no focus on quality education, said Adityanath, adding that the situation demanded something like ‘Mission Niramaya’ and the government delivered. “Under the mission, 12 good institutions were identified as mentors. As a result of the ongoing reform process with the mentor-mentee policy, today eight more institutes have been upgraded as mentors. This is the proof of the changing system,” said the chief minister.
Describing the Chief Minister’s vision as “inspiring” for an innovative effort like ‘Mission Niramaya’, Quality Council of India (QCI) Secretary General RP Singh said hailing the effort made by Uttar Pradesh, the NITI Aayog asked the Indian Nursing Council to implement a similar system across the country. Earlier, the QCI Secretary-General briefed the Chief Minister in detail about the process followed for deciding the ratings.
Singh said within 34 days, the QCI team went to every nursing and paramedical institute in the state to evaluate the quality of education based on the given parameters.
Emphasising the need for paramedical and nursing institutions, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Health and Medical Education Brajesh Pathak thanked the chief minister for bringing the policy of setting up nursing and paramedical institutions at every medical college and for making efforts to provide quality medical education in the state.

Adityanath said that the quality ranking of nursing and paramedical institutions conducted by the Quality Control of India with accuracy and transparency would inspire other institutions to do better. He said there could not be a compromise with the quality in educational institutions.
The Chief Minister said that the government decided to establish medical colleges on the PPP (Public Private Partnership) model in 16 unserved districts of the state.
In that sequence, private investors have been selected in Maharajganj and Sambhal in the past and construction of medical colleges was in progress at both places.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/up-government-to-establish-two-new-medical-colleges-in-mau-shamli-neet-ug-8829812/,education

AIIMS proposes to quash interview for PhD selection,"During AIIMS director Dr M Srinivas' interaction with the faculty, PhD students and scientists, it has been strongly suggested that there is an emergent requirement for reforming the selection process for PhD and award of Institute Fellowship at AIIMS New Delhi, an office memorandum issued on Tuesday said.","The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has proposed that it would do away with interviews at all stages of the PhD selection process and make it based on written exam with the aim to bring greater transparency. In order to enable high impact research at the institute, the administration further proposed to start 40-50 PhD Institute Fellowship at par with Prime Minister’s Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme and apportion a budget of Rs 200 crore for the same, subject to necessary approvals from statutory committees of AIIMS and Government of India.
These are a part of reforms suggested by the AIIMS administration on Tuesday for the selection process for PhD and award of Institute Fellowship.

During AIIMS director Dr M Srinivas’ interaction with the faculty, PhD students and scientists, it has been strongly suggested that there is an emergent requirement for reforming the selection process for PhD and award of Institute Fellowship at AIIMS New Delhi, an office memorandum issued on Tuesday said.
This is also essential to give a boost to high-quality research at the AIIMS and in turn enhance our NIRF rankings in research, it said.
Also, from the said discussion, it has emerged that there is a need to have an in-house funding mechanism to increase the intake of meritorious PhD students and award Institute Fellowship.
“The selection process should be completely objective, transparent and should be based on written examination (MCQs and OSCE/OSPE). There shall not be any interview at any stage,” the memorandum stated.
It also said that the PhD entrance examination should be conducted biannually along with DM/MCh entrance examination at various centres of the country.

“The academic section has been asked to examine the same and initiate appropriate agendas for further deliberations in the Staff Council, Academic Committee, Standing Finance Committee, to ensure an early implementation of these proposed reforms,” it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/aiims-proposes-to-quash-interview-for-phd-selection-8829283/,education

UAPA Event Cancellation: IISER Mohali issues notice to teachers critical of IISc Bangalore,"The institute has directed two of its faculty members, who were the only two from IISER Mohali to register ""dismay"" over IISc's cancellation of a talk on UAPA, to explain their actions by July 13","— Moin Shah
Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali has issued showcause notices to two of its faculty members for signing a recent letter addressed to the director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore to protest the last-minute cancellation of a discussion on the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) that was supposed to be led by student activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita.
The two faculty members, who were the only two teachers from the institute to sign the letter, have been directed to explain their participation without “obtaining the prior approval of the competent authority.” They have time till July 13 to respond, and the institute, meanwhile, has frozen “the notional allocation of funds” to the two teachers meant for research purposes. The administration has prima facie found them in violation of the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules, which are applicable to all employees of IISER Mohali.

The two teachers who have been asked to explain their actions and the institute’s director haven’t responded to The Indian Express‘ email seeking comment. This story will be updated once we get their response.
“I don’t think any rules within the CCS have been violated,” said an IISER Mohali faculty member. “This is reflective of what is happening in the larger country. ‘Protest is punishable’ is the kind of mentality which has been adopted over the years,” the faculty member added, pointing out that notices have been issued by the institute administration in the past as well, but it was “certainly not expected” in the case of the IISc letter.
The missive sent to the IISc Bangalore director on July 3 was signed by more than 500 scientists, academics, and students in which they expressed “dismay at the actions taken by the IISc administration to stop a discussion on the ‘Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Prisons and the Criminal Justice System’ that was to be led by Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita on June 28.” The letter, however, had stated clearly that the institutional affiliations provided against the name of each signatory was only for purposes of identification and that the signatures do not reflect the views of these institutes.

Narwal and Kalita were arrested in May 2020 for their alleged role in the Northeast Delhi riots conspiracy case and were later booked under the UAPA. The Delhi High Court had granted them bail a year later.

On June 27, the IISc Registrar, Sridhar Warrier, intervened and cancelled the event that was scheduled to be held at the Center for Continuing Education (CCE) for which student organizers had obtained permission from the CCE chair. This action was taken on the grounds that the organizers should have sought permission from the institute administration and not just the department.
“I think it is absurd that two academics at IISER cannot sign a perfectly reasonable letter to the director of another institution without being hauled up by their director. This violates basic tenets of academic freedom,” said Suvrat Raju, a faculty member at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS) of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and one of the signatories to the letter.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cant-sign-protest-letter-without-permission-iiser-mohali-issues-notice-to-teachers-critical-of-iisc-bangalore-8825531/,education

Every time we visited over here as the IIT Madras contingent, we noticed that the representation of women on their side is quite significant. So, it was important that we do this mindfully.”
Speaking to the media in Delhi, IIT Madras Director V Kamakoti said, “We will see many more encouraging things. We are following sustainable development goals and one of the important goals suggests that we need to bring in gender balance.”

Kamakoti announced that Prof Ligy Philip will be the in-charge of the infrastructure of the IIT Madras Zanzibar campus. She will be supervising the infrastructure of both the temporary as well as the permanent IIT Madras Zanzibar campus. The permanent campus will be spread across 200 acres on Zanzibar Island, with the master plan being developed by IIT Madras experts.
“We will be starting the campus on October 24, 2023, which is also the United Nations Day,” said V Kamakoti.
IIT Madras Zanzibar follows the motto of “IIT Madras open for all,” said V Kamakoti. Students, including Indians, will have to follow the IIT Madras Senate-approved admission process, followed by the screening test and an interview. The campus will offer a four-year bachelor of science degree in Data Science and AI (Artificial Intelligence) for $12,000 per annum and a two-year master of technology degree in the same for $4,000 per annum. Applications close by August 6. Prof Aghalayam said, “We will be offering a tuition break, the details are being worked out.”

IIT Madras Zanzibar also plans to offer joint-degree programmes as a part of their student exchange programme, mentioned V Kamakoti. “We are also enrolling students from Tanzania for PhD in IIT Madras so they can teach in Zanzibar and maintain a good flow of teachers.” Universities in Europe are also being reached out for exchange programmes.

IIT Madras Zanzibar campus plans to offer non-conventional courses in the next five years, including courses on Cyber-Physical Systems and courses based on “what the country needs.” “I am an organic farmer,” said V Kamakoti, commenting on planning to offer courses on regenerative agriculture implementing AI for agriculture.
V Kamakoti also mentioned that other IITs are also looking forward to launching international campuses, IIT Delhi being one of them that plans to establish a campus in Abu Dhabi. “We have pulled it through in six months. IIT Madras will be the knowledge partner, while the Zanzibar government will provide monetarily. It is a win-win situation,” said V Kamakoti.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-madras-zanzibar-to-be-the-first-ever-female-led-iit-jeemain-jeeadvanced-8823525/,education

I was in Class 8 back then and asked my father about it and got to know that IITs are the most prestigious engineering colleges in the country.

"CLAT 2024 preparations at advanced stage, introduction of additional language options will cause administrative, operational issues: NLUs to Delhi HC",The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is conducted in English at present. The exam for the 2024 academic year is scheduled for December.,"The Consortium of National Law Universities has told the Delhi High Court that any judicial order compelling the introduction of additional language options for CLAT 2024 this year, without discussions, will cause serious administrative and operation issues as the preparations are at an advanced stage right now.
The Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is conducted in English at present. The exam for the 2024 academic year is scheduled for December.
The consortium said it has constituted an expert committee of vice-chancellors of five member National Law Universities (NLUs) to study the issue of offering the exam in additional languages and to prepare a comprehensive roadmap after reviewing stakeholder viewpoints and potential constraints.
Also Read | CLAT 2024 registration begins; check steps to apply, deadline, syllabus changes
The submission was made in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the conduct of CLAT – 2024 in regional languages as well.
A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad directed the expert committee, constituted to consider the conduct of CLAT in multiple languages, to take a decision in their next meeting, scheduled for August.
The high court listed the matter for further hearing on September 1.
The PIL, filed by Delhi University law student Sudhanshu Pathak, contended that the CLAT (UG) examination “discriminates” and fails to provide a “level playing field” to students whose educational backgrounds are rooted in regional languages.
ADVERTISEMENT
The petitioner was represented through senior advocate Jayant Mehta and lawyers Akash Vajpai and Sakshi Raghav.
The consortium, in its reply, said the report of the expert committee will enable it to make suitable advance preparation for conducting the exam in additional languages in the coming years after ironing out all anticipated difficulties.
The committee held its first meeting on June 25 and framed certain issues relating to the subject matter, it said.
“Respondent No 1 (consortium) is thus already actively engaging with the question of holding CLAT in scheduled language options, but the process is one that requires considerable planning and preparation, to avoid any grievances amongst the student community as to disparity in preparatory materials, failure to ensure parity in testing, and other issues which can compromise the integrity of the CLAT examination,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The reply said the consortium does not dispute the need to examine the issue more closely. However, it will be highly premature for judicial intervention at this stage in the absence of any data to show that there is already a significant pool of students wanting to take the examination in the scheduled languages despite the medium of instruction at all NLUs being English.
“… given the advanced stage of preparedness already for the upcoming CLAT – 2024 examination, any judicial order compelling the introduction of additional language options this year itself, without the benefit of the studies and deliberations being undertaken internally and without allowing for any time for consequential preparation to be made by the respondent No 1 (consortium) on all the identified parameters, will cause grave prejudice to the respondent No 1,” it said.
It added that any sweeping direction, as prayed for in the writ petition, will result in serious administrative and operational issues that will not only adversely affect the conduct of this year’s examination but also the ongoing preparation of aspirants.
“Such changes to the examination pattern may end up being made in a knee-jerk manner which, in turn, will cause the student community — which is already preparing for the examination — grave hardship,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The high court had earlier asked the consortium if entrance examinations for medical and engineering courses can be held in regional languages, why not CLAT.

The petitioner said in the plea, “In a hyper-competitive paper, they (students from non-English language background) are linguistically disempowered as they have to surpass the additional hurdle of learning and mastering a new language.” “Naturally, aspirants belonging to English-medium schools have an advantage over their peers belonging to schools operating in Hindi or other vernacular languages. The underprivileged and disempowered aspirants can never view an exam solely based in English as ‘obvious’ unlike their privileged, English-speaking competitors,” the plea said.
The high court had earlier issued notices and sought responses of the Consortium of National Law Universities, Bar Council of India and the Centre through the Union Ministry of Education on the petition.
The plea said the National Education Policy 2020, and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, require mother tongue to be the medium of instruction in schools and higher education institutions.

It is unfortunate that English, as the only medium of CLAT (UG), is depriving a huge portion of the students, who have studied in their regional or native languages, of the opportunity to opt for a five-year LLB course, it said.
“Through this petition, the petitioner is seeking issuance of an appropriate writ or direction to respondent No 1 to conduct CLAT – 2024 not only in English language but all other regional languages of the Eighth schedule of the Constitution of India as practice of taking CLAT (UG) only in English has an element of arbitrariness and discrimination and hence violative of Article 14 and 29 (2) of the Constitution,” it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/clat-2024-preparations-at-advanced-stage-introduction-of-additional-options-will-cause-administrative-operational-issues-nlus-to-delhi-hc-8815960/,education

"Performance Grade Index Report 2021-22: Chandigarh, Punjab top performers in school education","Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu at 7th level","Chandigarh and Punjab emerged as the best performers in school education across indicators such as learning outcomes, equity and infrastructure in the Union Ministry of Education’s Performance Grade Index (PGI) for the year 2021-22 report released Friday.
Punjab and Chandigarh have been placed in the sixth grade of the index. The PGI grades states and UTs in 10 categories. No state or UT could make it to the top five grades. Chandigarh and Punjab are on ‘Prachesta -2’ level for which a state should score between 641-700 out of total 1,000 points.
Following them, there are six states and UTs at the level below. Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Puducherry, and Tamil Nadu have been placed at the 7th level — Prachesta-3 — with a score between 581-640 points. Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram are placed at the bottom of the pile with a score between 401-460 (Akanshi–3) .
Last year, the top-performing states — Kerala, Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh — had scored between 901 and 950 points out of 1,000.
The government attributed the drop in scores to a change in the assessment parameters. This year, the ministry reassigned weightage to the existing parameters and introduced a new one, acknowledging that the PGI assessment was “heavily tilted towards indicators related to governance processes rather than the quality indicator.”
Hence, for the ‘Learning Outcomes and Quality’ indicator, the ministry has assigned 240 points, compared to 180 last year, and for infrastructure, 190 points, up from 150 last year. Emphasis on the equity criterion has increased from 230 to 260 points. To accommodate the increased importance of these three parameters, the government has reduced the emphasis on governance processes from 360 to 130 points. Additionally, a new parameter of teacher training (with a weightage of 100 points) has been introduced this year.
“The new PGI structure covers 73 indicators, with more focus on qualitative assessment, including digital initiatives and teacher education. The grades/levels obtained by States/UTs in the previous edition of the PGIs are thus not comparable to the grades/levels obtained in this new edition,” the ministry said on Friday.

"Infra boost to expansion of eggs and scrapping NEP 2020, Karnataka education department sees new reforms","To prevent the menace of fake marks sheets, the government will make it mandatory for all the higher education students to get registered in Academic Bank of Credits and to access marks cards and certificates from NAD/Digilocker.","In one of the major policy reforms, the Siddaramiah led Congress government in its state budget for FY 2023-24 has announced the scrapping of the centre’s National Education Policy 2020 and formulating state’s own education policy, in tune with local, social, cultural and economic milieu of the state. The new policy aims to elevate the higher education standards in the state to the global level and empower youth to compete globally and gain employment opportunities.
The Congress government has allocated a total of Rs 37,587 crore (11%) for the education sector out of the total budget expenditure.

"After JEE Advanced, how to choose between IITs and branches? Former IIT Guwahati director explains","Gautam Barua writes: “Computing technology is now well integrated into every science and engineering field. Almost all disciplines are using AI techniques to solve difficult problems in their field. So, you will be 'CSE savvy' if you join an IIT, no matter what branch you get into.”","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
— Gautam Barua
The seat allotment process for admission to the Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) is underway as we speak. All of you have already given your choices with priorities, so we cannot talk of what your choices should be. However, once you get a seat, you will have to decide whether to accept the seat or not.
If you do not get into an IIT, your other choices could be a seat in an NIT or an IIIT.
Read | 'The timeline is aggressive but we are hopeful': Director of IIT Madras Zanzibar
But the IIT brand, which has immense value at the workplace, attracts most students. But why are IITs so highly valued?
A main reason is the success of some IIT graduates in the global arena. This begs a natural question: is the IIT teaching programme better than other institutes that graduates from the institute end up being better than others?
Indeed, the academic environment in IITs is very good; the faculty of high quality. However, the main reason why IIT graduates do so well is this: the best students join the IIT system.
This ensures the quality of the graduates, even if a particular IIT is not doing very well in its teaching programme. The second reason is that the best faculty candidates are also “lured” to IITs because of the branding.
ADVERTISEMENT
These reasons lead the government to provide more funds per capita to IITs than to other Institutes under it (the NITs and IIITs). This reinforces the strength of the IITs. It is a win-win situation all the way!
Besides this, it is also important to consider the question of which IIT to join. This decision is almost entirely made by the previous year’s opening and closing ranks of an IIT.
Usually, students make choices based on the rank they obtain and the opening and closing rank inputs. They follow the herd, with their first three choices usually being Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in the three metro IITs.
Also read | IIT-Bombay director defends engineers’ non-core career choices
But if your rank is well above the closing rank of CSE in these IITs, even if you keep these as your top choices, you will make the next choices based on closing ranks. So, if the “best” of the best go CSE in these IITs, won’t the outcome also be the “best”?
ADVERTISEMENT
There are two issues to consider here. First of all, if you barely made it to CSE in one of the metro IITs, and if the academic outcomes closely follow the JEE outcome, you will at best be in the bottom half of the class.
On the other hand, if you break ranks and give CSE at another IIT as a higher choice than for CSE at the metro IITs, you will surely get admitted into the IIT you chose, and you are most likely to be in the top 5% of the class there.
Additionally, it is also important to note that the IIT ranking does not put students in an absolute order of merit. You know that the two marks you got less in the JEE Mathematics paper because of a “mistake” which might have lowered your rank by at least 500, if not more. So, it is difficult to distinguish among students within, say, the top 25,000 ranks. Some with lower ranks may also have done very well in their school and they might even end up doing better in the BTech programme than someone with a much higher rank.
So, it does not matter which IIT you join. All of them will have “brilliant” students like you as colleagues, and you will have a really good environment for studying.
ADVERTISEMENT
Finally, let me mention the choice of branches. Students’ choices are almost entirely based on the job market. CSE rules supreme here.
If you read what I wrote in the above paragraphs, I have basically said that IITs are well above the level of NITs and IIITs, and all IITs are similar. I do not have time to analyse the issues here, but my advice is this — if you do not have strong preferences, and you are following what “everyone” is telling you to do, then you should join an IIT over any other institute. You can change your field after you complete your programme, do an MBA to get into the corporate world, do a master’s in CSE somewhere and switch over to CSE if that is what you wish after four years. The options are endless.
You should also remember that computing technology is now well integrated into every science and engineering field. The recent buzz is of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. Almost all disciplines are using AI techniques to solve difficult problems in their field. So, you will be “CSE savvy” if you join an IIT, no matter what branch you get into. Also, please remember, CSE is not everything.
Its algorithms and techniques are only tools to be used to tackle and crack the really fascinating and challenging problems of today, be they be in energy, climate, food, health, transportation, communication.

"Specify steps taken for providing non-discriminatory, enabling environment to ST, SC category students: Supreme Court to UGC","The petitioners also sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to ensure that all universities, including deemed universities and higher educational institutions, comply with UGC equity regulations in ""letter and in spirit"".","University Grants Commissions (UGC) has been asked by the Supreme Court to specify the steps it has taken and has proposed to take to provide non-discriminatory and enabling environment for students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes categories in institutions of higher learning. The apex court termed it as a “very serious issue.”
A bench of Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh asked the UGC to furnish the details of steps taken on a plea by the mothers of Rohith Vemula and Payal Tadvi, who had allegedly died by suicide following alleged caste-based discrimination in their educational institutions.
While Vemula, a dalit PhD scholar at Hyderabad Central University, had ended his life on January 17, 2016, Tadvi, a tribal student at TN Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai, took the extreme step on May 22, 2019 due to alleged caste-based discrimination by three doctors of her institution.
“This is a very serious issue. Whatever concerns are raised… how do you propose to deal with it and what steps have you taken to address these grievances? This issue is non-adversarial and the UGC needs to take some concrete action. It is for the benefit of students and their parents. Steps taken would ensure that these types of incidents don’t happen in future,” the bench told the counsel appearing for the UGC.
Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the mothers of Vemula and Tadvi, said they have lost their son and daughter respectively, and in the past one year three more students studying at a National Law School, a medical college and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay have taken their lives.

“Therefore, there is a sense of urgency about this petition. It would be appropriate that UGC formulates binding guidelines which can be followed by institutes of higher learning.
“It is unfortunate that the existing guidelines do not have a binding effect as they do not have any sanction for violation of the norms. There should be some regulations like Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) at Workplace Act and the anti-ragging law, which provides for punitive action in case of violation”, Jaising said.
ADVERTISEMENT
She said equity regulations framed by the UGC in 2012 to address the complaints of caste discrimination on campuses are proving to be inadequate.
The counsel for UGC said the Commission is aware of the situation and has written to vice-chancellors of universities and college principals.
Justice Sundresh told the counsel that efforts needed to be made so the students from SC/ST communities are main-streamed.
“You need to ensure that there is no discrimination as some of them may drop out of the college/universities, if they don’t get along with other students. For this, some out of the box solutions are needed,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bench then asked the UGC counsel to elicit suggestions from the petitioners and file a reply specifying the steps it has taken and proposed to take to create a non-discriminatory environment on campuses within four weeks.
On September 20, 2019, the top court had issued notice on the plea by the mothers of Vemula and Tadvi, seeking to end caste bias in universities and other higher education institutions across the country. It had sought responses from the Centre and the UGC on the petition.
The petitioners have sought enforcement of fundamental rights, particularly the right to equality, right to prohibition of discrimination against caste, and the right to life.
The petition has claimed rampant prevalence of caste-based discrimination in higher educational institutions throughout the country and said it reflects flagrant non-compliance with existing norms and regulations.
ADVERTISEMENT
It hasfurther said these incidents are violative of the fundamental rights to equality, equal opportunity, right against discrimination, abolition of untouchability, and right to life guaranteed under Article 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21 of the Constitution.
The petitioners have sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to strictly ensure enforcement of and compliance with the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012, popularly called ‘UGC equity regulations’. They have also sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to ensure that all universities, including deemed universities and higher educational institutions, comply with UGC equity regulations in “letter and in spirit”.
The plea has sought court’s direction to ensure that all universities and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) establish Equal Opportunity Cells and such other anti-discrimination internal complaint mechanisms, and to include members from SC/ST communities and independent representatives from NGOs or social activists to ensure objectivity and impartiality in the process.
It has also sought direction to all universities to take strong disciplinary action against victimisation of students or staff who file complaints alleging caste-based discrimination, and to take necessary steps in the nature of interim reliefs that restrain the HEI from creating a hostile environment against students who file such complaints.
ADVERTISEMENT
Besides these directions, the petition has sought various steps to ensure an end to caste-based discrimination on campuses.
“Since 2004, there have been over 20 documented instances of students committing suicides across the universities in the country. Various committees set up to look into these deaths have concluded that SC, ST students have faced systematic discrimination in matters of allotting supervisors, caste-based abuses, problems in matters of scholarships, and more,” the plea has said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/specify-steps-taken-for-providing-non-discriminatory-enabling-environment-to-sc-st-category-students-sc-to-ugc-8788926/,education

Persons with benchmark disabilities will not have to pay any fee to appear in the examination.
AIIMS, Delhi has been entrusted with the job of conducting the mock test. It will be a computer-based examination consisting of multiple-choice questions, sources said.
The aim of conducting the mock test is to familiarise the prospective candidates with the computer-based test, software interface and process flow at the examination centres.
The NMC issued the NExT (National Exit Test) Regulations, 2023 on Friday, stating that the exam will be held in two phases, with the NExT Step 1 and NExT Step 2 exams being held twice a year.

In a gazette notification, the NMC said the NExT shall form the basis of certifying the eligibility of a medical graduate to register to practise the modern system of medicine in India and therefore, serve as a licentiate examination.
It will also form the basis for determining the eligibility and ranking for the purpose of admission of those desirous of pursuing further postgraduate medical education in the country in broad medical specialities and therefore, serve as an entrance examination for admission to courses of PG medical education.
After clearing NExT Step 1, they will be doing an internship for a year and their NExT Step 1 score will be considered for admission into postgraduate courses.
After the internship, the medical students will have to clear NExT Step 2 to become eligible for getting the licence and registration to practise modern medicine in India.

Foreign medical graduates who want to practise in India will have to appear in NExT Step 1, do the internship and then, clear NExT Step 2 to become eligible for the same.
The sample questions in the mock or practice test will only exemplify the pattern and format of NExT Step 1.
NExT Step 1 will have six subject papers with respective weightage in items and time allocation.

Periodic table chapter dropped from Class 10 NCERT science textbook in ‘rationalisation’ exercise,"The Class 11 chapter in the Chemistry textbook on the same topic, however, has been retained","“The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept in chemistry, both in principle and in practice….An awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements.”
The chapter on ‘Classification in Elements and Periodicity in Properties’ in NCERT’s Class 11 Chemistry textbook begins with these words of American chemist Glenn T Seaborg. Yet, a full chapter, which introduces students to the topic, has been removed from NCERT’s Class 10 Science textbook as part of the council’s “rationalisation” exercise. The Class 11 chapter on the topic, however, remains part of the syllabus.
The deletion from the Class 10 textbooks was made by the NCERT in June 2022, saying, “In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.” Among other deletions, made last year, from the class 10 Science textbook include passages on ‘Evolution’. The new textbooks with deletions and changes made last year have now hit the market.
‘Evolution’, including the Darwininian theory on natural selection, remains a part of the school curriculum though as NCERT’s Class 12 Biology textbook has a full chapter on the subject. Among other topics which have been spiked from Science textbooks include chapters on Fibre and Fabrics in Classes 6, 7 and 8.
The Class 6 chapter on the topic had a reference on Mahatma Gandhi in the context of charkha. “Another hand operated device for spinning is charkha. Use of charkha was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi as part of the Independence movement. He encouraged people to wear clothes made of homespun yarn and shun imported cloth made in the mills of Britain,” it said.
Read | NCERT deletions show ‘non-academic, partisan agenda’: Historians
Another deletion that stands out is of the chapter “Why do we fall ill” from Class 9 Science textbook. Ironically, the chapter introduces students to viruses and air-borne diseases such as Covid-19, citing which the rationalisation exercise was carried out by the NCERT.
“Such disease-causing microbes can spread through the air. This occurs through the little droplets thrown out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs. Someone standing close by can breathe in these droplets, and the microbes get a chance to start a new infection. Examples of such diseases spread through the air are the common cold, coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pneumonia and tuberculosis,” read a paragraph in the chapter which was updated after the pandemic broke out.

But the entire chapter was axed citing the need to reduce content load due to disruptions in learning caused by Covid-19. Apart from its in-house experts, the NCERT had roped in 25 external experts, drawn from the faculty of Delhi University, ICHR, various Kendriya Vidyalayas and private schools for carrying out the rationalisation.
The factors cited by the NCERT behind the deletions include content which are “overlapping”, “not relevant or outdated in the present context”, “difficult”, “easily accessible to children and can be learned through self-learning or peer-learning”.

‘Can’t change Govt order on Hijab just like that’: Karnataka Minister Madhu Bangarappa,"The Supreme Court delivered a split judgment in October 2022, the matter has now been referred to a three-judge bench.","Amidst an ongoing legal battle regarding the validity of wearing hijab in educational institutions in Karnataka, the newly appointed School Education Minister, Madhu Bangarappa, has stated that the Congress government cannot immediately change the government order that bans hijab in classes. The Congress government had promised to lift restrictions on hijab as part of its electoral campaign in Karnataka.
In February 2022, the BJP government in Karnataka issued an order mandating uniforms prescribed by the government or private institution managements for students in schools and pre-university colleges across the state, following the hijab controversy. In March 2022, the Karnataka High Court dismissed petitions filed by a group of Muslim students who sought permission to wear hijab inside classrooms.

In an interview to The Indian Express, Bangarappa remarked, “We cannot change the government order on hijab just like that. We have to abide by the law. The law department will handle the matter and make a decision. For years, everything was functioning smoothly. Imposing a sudden ban on hijab was unnecessary. The BJP politicised the issue, creating complications. Since the matter is sub judice, I prefer not to comment further.”
Earlier, speaking to this newspaper, Priyank Kharge, Bangarappa’s colleague in the cabinet, had also said that the Congress government will have to study the “legal aspects” before committing to overturn the hijab order since the matter is subjudice. “We will look into the legal aspect of it (hijab issue) and take a call. There is data to show that nearly 18,000 students are left out of schools because of a certain order. If the judiciary gets into legislation, what should legislators do then? If our legislation is bad, let the courts intervene. Any executive order, bill or ordinance that is regressive will be reviewed to get Karnataka back on track,” Kharge has said.

The Karnataka High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, Justice Krishna S Dixit, and Justice J M Khazi, upheld the government order, stating that prescribing school uniforms is a reasonable restriction and constitutionally permissible, to which students cannot object. However, the petitioners approached the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court’s decision and seeking the dismissal of the Karnataka government order banning hijab in classrooms.

The Supreme Court delivered a split judgment in October 2022. Justice Hemant Gupta upheld the Karnataka High Court order, validating the ban and stating that it promotes uniformity and encourages a secular environment in classrooms. On the other hand, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia set aside the state and High Court orders, emphasizing that the right to wear hijab in classrooms is a matter of choice and a fundamental right linked to the girl’s dignity and privacy, even within school premises.
Following the Supreme Court’s split verdict, the matter has now been referred to a three-judge bench.

The hijab controversy emerged in December 2021 when six female students from Government PU College in Udupi claimed they were not permitted to attend classes while wearing hijabs. This sparked protests that spread to other districts, resulting in the state issuing an order for students to adhere to prescribed uniforms in PUC (Class 11 and 12) and degree colleges.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cant-change-govt-order-on-hijab-just-like-that-karnataka-education-minister-8639188/,education

NCERT drops references to ‘Khalistan’ in Class 12th political science textbook,The changes were made after the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) objected to the references. The committee said on Tuesday that it would study the changes before taking a fresh stand on the issue.,"The references to ‘Khalistan’ and ‘separate Sikh nation’, which were mentioned in context of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, have been dropped from the Class 12 political science textbook of the NCERT, the Union Ministry of Education announced Tuesday.
The changes were made after the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) objected to the references. The SGPC Tuesday said that it would study the changes before taking a fresh stand on the issue.
“We will analyse the changes made by the NCERT before dropping our objections. Our experts will look into the matter,” an SGPC spokesman told The Indian Express.
Department of School Education and Literacy Secretary Sanjay Kumar said that the decision to remove the references was taken by an expert committee of the NCERT to prevent possibilities of reading them out of context. The Sikh body’s objection pertained to the mention of the Anandpur Sahib resolution in the book “Politics In India Since Independence”.
The reference to ‘Sikh nation’ has been exercised from the passage: “The resolution also spoke of the aspirations of the Sikh community and declared its goal as attaining the ‘bolbala’ (dominance) of the Sikhs. The resolution was a plea for strengthening federalism, but it could also be interpreted as a plea for a separate Sikh nation”.

The sentence “the resolution was a plea for strengthening federalism but it could also be interpreted as a plea for a
separate Sikh nation” had been dropped and rewritten as “the resolution was a plea for strengthening federalism”.
The line, “The more extreme elements started advocating secession from India and the creation of ‘Khalistan’” has also been dropped.

In a statement, the NCERT said, “In view of the representation received from stakeholders, particularly a letter from the SGPC regarding withdrawing objectionable content against Sikh community by misrepresenting Sri Anandpur Sahib Resolution.”

The apex court was hearing a plea filed by Chandan Kumar and others against the eligibility criterion of 75 per cent marks in Class 12 board exams for admission to IITs. The counsel appearing for the petitioners contended the students were given a waiver during the Covid-19 pandemic and the same students now have greater chances to clear the examination for admission to the prestigious engineering institutes.
“They have scored more than 98 per cent in Joint Entrance Examination, JEE (Main). These are meritorious students. Kindly allow them,” the counsel said. The lawyer submitted that the applicant has scored 92 percentile in JEE Mains and is eligible to appear in JEE Advanced. However, she will not get admission even if she qualifies as her board exam score is less than 75 per cent.

‘Should encourage girl students at school level to take up engineering courses’: MAHE VC,"'It is important to provide additional scholarships, perhaps provide a necessary support system at the school level to take up science and technology as a subject and bring in academic and career counselling sessions at the school level,' MAHE V-C M D Venkatesh said.","On the sidelines of the ‘W20-MAHE Women Vice Chancellors’ and Leaders’ Conclave’, Vice Chancellor of MAHE Dr M D Venkatesh speaks to indianexpress.com about what the lack of women in workforce, on India being the largest exporter of students and action against controversial professor who made the ‘Kasab’ remark.
Q: What does the new MAHE campus in Bengaluru offer its students?
A: This is a very ambitious project for MAHE. We started building it in 2020 and started our academic programmes in 2021-22. Institutions that are housed here are Manipal Institute of Technology and Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru campus. As for MIT, already two batches have got admitted and the third batch will be admitted now. We are offering niche engineering courses like computer science, cyber security, AI and information technology, data science and electronics and communication. Srishti has become a part of the MAHE from 2020 and three batches of students are a part of the institution. We also started the Manipal Law School in this campus and the first batch has already joined. In the campus, we also have a department of liberal arts, social science, humanities and public policies which we will be expanding in a way.

Q: Despite India housing several institutions of imminence, many students still prefer to pursue higher education in foreign universities. Why?
A: I don’t think this is because of the lack of quality education. It is because of the number of opportunities available for the students to excel. In India, all admissions are based on entrance exams and merit based-admissions. Many people do get left out because capacity is just not there to absorb all undergraduate students who qualify for post graduate programmes. But the new National Education Policy will make the situation better as it is expected to bring higher capacity building in the system. Inviting foreign universities to India and allowing Indian universities to collaborate with foreign universities — all these things will empower our students to hold on to our country and also help in providing quality education at par with foreign universities. India is a net exporter of students for higher education outside. At some stage we would like to reverse this trend. With the NEP, higher education is opening up big time now and it’s going to get better and better.
Q: With the Congress government in Karnataka planning to withdraw the NEP, how do you think it will impact higher education institutions?
A: We (MAHE) are absolutely out of this regulation. We are an institution of imminence and deemed to be a university. We don’t come under the state government plan. We had our own NEP implementation plan which started two months after the NEP was announced. We have our own five-year NEP plan that we are implementing in sync with the changes proposed by the policy. We have already changed our three-year programmes, four-year programmes, introducing the multiple entry, multiple exit and other modifications. We also have a roadmap with parameters as to how much we are implementing, what have we achieved, what are the gaps and how the gaps will be covered up. As an institution of imminence, we have a fair amount of flexibility in general education to do things differently and take decisions independently without unduly being under the control of regulators. There is regulatory control in medicine and law, which is an impediment. However, with the status of IoE and other provisions of the government, it is definitely empowering us to make thighs better.
ADVERTISEMENT
Q: After The Indian Express published the three-part series on the delay in implementing the Institute of Eminence (IoE) scheme by the UGC, has there been any development?
A: We haven’t heard anything from them (UGC). We had a review meeting with the Institutions of Eminence discussing the progress of IoE but nothing specific on any other issues that was raised in the article. Even the empowered expert committee is yet to be constituted. There has been no follow up.
Q: Very few girls take up engineering courses, what according to you is the reason?
A: First, we should encourage girls to take up science and mathematics at the school level. It is important to provide additional scholarships, perhaps provide a necessary support system at the school level to take up science and technology as a subject and bring in academic and career counselling sessions at the school level. We should make them realise that it’s not about just seeking a career as an employee, you can yourself become an employer if you take STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and Mathematics) as your subjects.
ADVERTISEMENT
You can take up entrepreneurship, industrial research or academic research. It’s about building the aptitude and supporting the aptitude. Perhaps we could also create a quota system for high calibre girls to get into higher education. The social construct also plays a major role in the empowerment of women. Women are thought to be homemakers. There needs to be efforts to eradicate social and cultural barriers. The minute more and more women get into the productivity stage, the GDP will automatically increase. They are already doing a lot of unpaid jobs like household chores and as domestic help for which they are not being remunerated or for which the amount is not counted against.
Q: Your thoughts on the ratio of women vice chancellors compared to men in Indian institutions?
The presence of women vice chancellors is comparatively less but things are improving. It’s a global phenomenon and India is slightly lagging in that front. The day is not far when MAHE will have a woman vice chancellor.
Q: What action did MAHE take against the professor who called a student ‘Kasab’?
ADVERTISEMENT
A: The professor has not been sacked but has been punished. We have taken a very stringent disciplinary action against him. He is currently under good mentoring and monitoring. In fact, the student has also reconciled and did not want any action to be taken against the professor. There was a disciplinary committee and there was a recommendation and action was taken as per the regulations of the university. We have given him some major punishments which I better not disclose. He is under careful mentorship. The matter stands closed with the disciplinary action taken against the professor.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/should-encourage-girl-students-at-school-level-to-take-up-engineering-courses-mahe-v-c-8631615/,education

DU Academic Council clears syllabi changes; chapter on Muhammad Iqbal scrapped from BA Pol Science,The council also passed resolutions to set up two new centres -- one related to Partition studies and another one on Tribal studies.,"The Delhi University‘s Academic Council has approved several resolutions, including some contentious ones like the implementation of a four-year integrated teacher education programme, despite dissent by some members.
The council also cleared several syllabi changes, including the scrapping of a chapter on Muhammad Iqbal from the BA political science syllabus, officials aware of the matter said.
The meeting, which began Friday, went on till 1:30 am on Saturday.

The council approved a resolution to replace the Bachelor of Elementary Education (B.El.Ed.) programme with the four-year integrated teacher education programme.
Six members of the Academic Council dissented against the resolution, saying there was no consultation with teachers in this regard.
“It is unfortunate that ITEP has been passed despite the dissent of the members. We will continue our fight to safeguard the interests of stakeholders,” AC elected member Maya John told PTI.
Maya John was part of a group of members who dissented against the resolution.
ADVERTISEMENT
Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP) will be replacing B.El.Ed. programme, which was introduced in 1994. The Delhi University was the only university to have its own integrated four-year programme.
In their dissent notes, members have argued that the Committee of Courses and the Faculty of Education have been completely bypassed in bringing the NCTE notification on ITEP directly to the Academic Council.
Another controversial resolution that was passed was related to capping the class size for lectures and tutorials at 60 and 30 students, respectively, for undergraduate programmes.
A section of AC members also opposed this resolution, saying the increase in the group size of lectures, tutorials and practicals is going to negatively impact the teaching-learning process.
ADVERTISEMENT
Syllabus of several semesters across courses were presented in the council and approved.
The council also passed a motion to remove a chapter on Pakistan’s national poet Muhammad Iqbal from the political science syllabus, members of the statutory body confirmed.
Born in 1877 in Sialkot in undivided India, Iqbal wrote the famous song “Saare jahan se achcha”.
He is often credited with giving birth to the idea of Pakistan. The chapter, titled ‘Modern Indian Political Thought’, is part of BA’s sixth-semester paper, officials said, adding that the matter will now be presented before the Executive Council of the university that will take the final call.
ADVERTISEMENT
The council also passed resolutions to set up two new centres — one related to Partition studies and another one on Tribal studies.
Some of the members also issued dissent notes against the two resolutions.
The Centre for Independence and Partition Studies will facilitate research on the “high voltage politics” accompanying the country’s Partition and how the then central leadership failed to contain the “germs of separatism”, they said.
It will also focus on the “non-insistence of central leadership on having the Frontier Province with India” and the way the “Congress Working Committee consented to the Partition without consulting (Mahatma) Gandhi”, according to the documents.
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile, the new Centre on Tribal Studies will have seven major objectives, which include understanding the term “tribe” from an India-centric perspective and studying the “social, cultural, linguistic, religious, economic, and environmental diversity and commonalities” of different tribes.
During the zero hour, a section of Academic Council members raised a slew of issues including those related to displaced temporary and ad hoc teachers.
The members also protested against a Delhi University notification asking colleges to remain open from 8 am to 8 pm without any discussion in the Academic Council and the Executive Council.
According to the statement, the members “strongly fought” against salary delays and delay of grants and funds to 12 Delhi University colleges that are entirely funded by the Delhi government.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/du-academic-council-clears-syllabi-changes-chapter-on-muhammad-iqbal-scrapped-from-ba-political-science-8631703/,education
