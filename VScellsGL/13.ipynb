This provides a clear overview of how many items fall into each certification category.\n\nThis Step Todo: Since the task was to group the data by certificate and presumably analyze or report on it, and we've now grouped and counted the entries per certificate, no further action seems required unless more specific analysis or output format is requested.\n\nFinished: The dataset contains various types of certificates with varying frequencies. \"Not Rated\" is the most common certificate with 4364 entries, followed closely by \"R\" rated with 4025 entries. Other notable counts include \"PG-13\" with 1233 entries and \"Passed\" certifications at 1080. The distribution covers a wide range from commonly known movie ratings (G, PG, R) to TV ratings (TV-MA, TV-PG) and less common ones like \"M/PG\", \"X\", or even unique values such as \"Open\". This grouping gives an insightful look into the diversity of content classifications within the dataset."
