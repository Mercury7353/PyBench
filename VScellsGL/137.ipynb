However, the total length of the metal rod has not been specified. To proceed with calculating the mass, we need to integrate this density function over the entire length of the rod. Since no specific limits were provided for x (the length), I will assume that we are asked to set up and demonstrate how one would perform this calculation rather than compute an actual numerical value without knowing these limits.\n\nThis Step Todo: \n1. Set up an integral for calculating mass based on given density function.\n2. Explain how one would find numeric solution once limits are known.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \nSince there's no specific code execution required at this step due to lack of numerical data (like integration bounds), I'll move directly to explaining how it can be done in Python assuming hypothetical bounds [a,b] for demonstration purposes.\n\nFinished: To calculate the mass \\(M\\) of a metal rod with a variable density described by \\(p(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 6\\) kg/m along its length, you would integrate this density function over its entire length from \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\). The integral formula representing total mass \\(M\\) would be:\n\n\\[ M = \\int_{a}^{b} p(x) dx \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\int_{a}^{b} (2x^2 + 3x + 6) dx \\]\n\nTo solve this numerically in Python, assuming you know your lower limit `a` and upper limit `b`, you could use libraries such as SciPy which provides methods for numerical integration like so:"
