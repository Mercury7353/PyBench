However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath , which enhances the mathematical rea-\nsoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed Reinforced Evol-Instruct\nmethod to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathe-\nmatical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the ex-\ntraordinary capabilities of our model. WizardMath surpasses all other open-\nsource LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms\nChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously\nsurpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and\nmodel weights are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM3and\nhttps://huggingface.co/WizardLM .\n1 Introduction\nRecently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention and become\nthe go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain\nconversation [ 1\u20134], coding [ 5\u201313] and math [ 14\u201319]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed\nby OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further \ufb01ne-\ntuning with speci\ufb01c instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched\ntheir competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta\u2019s series of Llama [ 4,20] models have\nsparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs.\nThis trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT8, Falcon [ 21], StarCoder [ 12], Alpaca [ 22],\nVicuna [ 23], and WizardLM [ 24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios\nwhich require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science\nchallenges [25\u201335].\n\u21e4Equal contribution. Work done during the internship of Luo at Microsoft Research.\n\u2020Corresponding author: caxu@microsoft.com and shifeng.chen@siat.ac.cn\n3We are working with our legal team to review and publicly release the code and data in accordance with\nour policy.\nPreprint.
