These include steady increases in both volume and profitability within its feed business alongside improvements in cost reduction and efficiency within its pig breeding operations. Despite a minor revenue increase in 2023 (+0.14%), there was a significant rise in net profits (+117.07%) attributed largely to external investments into their poultry and food sectors which alleviated some operational pressures. With an anticipated improvement in performance towards the second half of 2024 driven by reversals in the pig cycle, adjustments have been made to earnings forecasts up until 2026 reflecting an optimistic outlook on profitability across these periods."
