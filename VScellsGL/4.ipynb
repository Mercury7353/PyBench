Given that some of these fields (like 'link') can be considered non-essential for certain analyses or could be replaced by other identifiers (e.g., 'link-href'), a decision needs to be made on how to handle these remaining nulls.\n\nThis Step Todo: For this step, I will focus on handling the remaining columns with missing values in a way that preserves as much data as possible. Specifically:\n- Since the 'link' column is redundant given that we have a functional URL in the 'link-href' column, it's safe to drop the entire 'link' column.\n- For numerical columns like rating and number_of_recommendations which have missing values, filling them with an average value might distort analysis due to their subjective nature; thus, they may either be left as is or filled with a placeholder indicating data was not available.\n- The price field is essential but has some missing values; considering it's critical for any financial analysis but cannot easily be imputed without potentially skewing data significantly, those rows might need further inspection before deciding whether to fill them based on similar items or another strategy.\n\nFirstly, let's remove the redundant link column.\n\nCode(WARNING:MAKE SURE YOU CODE FOLLOW THE FORMAT AND WRITE CODE OR THE TASK WILL BE FAILED): \n<|execute_start|>"
