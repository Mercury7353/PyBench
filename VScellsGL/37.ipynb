The mean closing price is approximately $709.46, with a median of $438.15, indicating a positive skew in the distribution of prices. The standard deviation is quite high at $672.04, suggesting significant volatility in Google's stock prices over the observed period.\n\nThis Step Todo:\nBased on the analysis so far, to make a recommendation on whether to hold or sell Google stocks, we need to consider both the historical data trends and statistical measures. Given the high volatility (as indicated by the standard deviation) but an overall upward trend in closing prices (as seen from the plot), it seems that Google's stock has potential for growth despite short-term fluctuations.\n\nFinished: Based on our analysis of your holding in Google stocks which includes calculating key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation along with visualizing the trend of closing prices over time; it appears that although there is significant volatility in Google\u2019s stock price as evidenced by a high standard deviation ($672.04), there has been an overall upward trend historically. This suggests that if you are able to withstand short-term fluctuations and focus on long-term gains, continuing to hold onto your shares could be beneficial given past performance trends.\nHowever, please note this analysis does not take into account future market conditions or specific financial goals and risk tolerance. It would be prudent to also consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions.\n"
